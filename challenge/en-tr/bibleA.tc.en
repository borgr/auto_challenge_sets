in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth .
now the earth was formless and empty . darkness was on the surface of the deep . God 's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters .
God said , " Let there be light , " and there was light .
God saw the light , and saw that it was good . God divided the light from the darkness .
God called the light " day , " and the darkness he called " night . " there was evening and there was morning , one day .
God said , " Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters . "
God made the expanse , and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse ; and it was so .
God called the expanse " sky . " there was evening and there was morning , a second day .
God said , " Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place , and let the dry land appear " ; and it was so .
God called the dry land " earth , " and the gathering together of the waters he called " seas . " God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let the earth yield grass , herbs yielding seed , and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind , with its seed in it , on the earth " ; and it was so .
the earth yielded grass , herbs yielding seed after their kind , and trees bearing fruit , with its seed in it , after their kind ; and God saw that it was good .
God made the two great lights : the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night . he also made the stars .
God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth ,
there was evening and there was morning , a fourth day .
God said , " Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky . "
God created the large sea creatures , and every living creature that moves , with which the waters swarmed , after their kind , and every winged bird after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God blessed them , saying , " Be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let birds multiply on the earth . "
there was evening and there was morning , a fifth day .
God said , " Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind , livestock , creeping things , and animals of the earth after their kind " ; and it was so .
God made the animals of the earth after their kind , and the livestock after their kind , and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the birds of the sky , and over the livestock , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth . "
God created man in his own image . in God 's image he created him ; male and female he created them .
God blessed them . God said to them , " Be fruitful , multiply , fill the earth , and subdue it . have dominion over the fish of the sea , over the birds of the sky , and over every living thing that moves on the earth . "
God said , " behold , I have given you every herb yielding seed , which is on the surface of all the earth , and every tree , which bears fruit yielding seed . it will be your food .
to every animal of the earth , and to every bird of the sky , and to everything that creeps on the earth , in which there is life , I have given every green herb for food " ; and it was so .
God saw everything that he had made , and , behold , it was very good . there was evening and there was morning , a sixth day .
the heavens and the earth were finished , and all their vast array .
on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
God blessed the seventh day , and made it holy , because he rested in it from all his work which he had created and made .
this is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens .
no plant of the field was yet in the earth , and no herb of the field had yet sprung up ; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth . there was not a man to till the ground ,
but a mist went up from the earth , and watered the whole surface of the ground .
Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
Yahweh God planted a garden eastward , in Eden , and there he put the man whom he had formed .
out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden , and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil .
a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from there it was parted , and became four heads .
the name of the first is Pishon : this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold ;
and the gold of that land is good . there is aromatic resin and the onyx stone .
the name of the second river is Gihon : the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush .
the name of the third river is Hiddekel : this is the one which flows in front of Assyria . the fourth river is the Euphrates .
Yahweh God took the man , and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it .
Yahweh God commanded the man , saying , " Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat ;
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die . "
Yahweh God said , " It is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him a helper suitable for him . "
the man gave names to all livestock , and to the birds of the sky , and to every animal of the field ; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him .
Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man , and he slept ; and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh in its place .
he made the rib , which Yahweh God had taken from the man , into a woman , and brought her to the man .
the man said , " This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh . she will be called ' woman , ' because she was taken out of Man . "
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother , and will join with his wife , and they will be one flesh .
they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
the woman said to the serpent , " Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat ,
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden , God has said , ' You shall not eat of it , neither shall you touch it , lest you die . ' "
the serpent said to the woman , " You won 't surely die ,
for God knows that in the day you eat it , your eyes will be opened , and you will be like God , knowing good and evil . "
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was a delight to the eyes , and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise , she took of its fruit , and ate ; and she gave some to her husband with her , and he ate .
the eyes of both of them were opened , and they knew that they were naked . they sewed fig leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden .
the man said , " I heard your voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself . "
God said , " Who told you that you were naked ? have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from ? "
the man said , " The woman whom you gave to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I ate . "
Yahweh God said to the woman , " What is this you have done ? " the woman said , " The serpent deceived me , and I ate . "
I will put enmity between you and the woman , and between your offspring and her offspring . he will bruise your head , and you will bruise his heel . "
it will yield thorns and thistles to you ; and you will eat the herb of the field .
by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are dust , and to dust you shall return . "
the man called his wife Eve , because she was the mother of all living .
Yahweh God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife , and clothed them .
therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden , to till the ground from which he was taken .
so he drove out the man ; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden , and the flame of a sword which turned every way , to guard the way to the tree of life .
the man knew Eve his wife . she conceived , and gave birth to Cain , and said , " I have gotten a man with Yahweh 's help . "
again she gave birth , to Cain 's brother Abel . Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
as time passed , it happened that Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground .
Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat . Yahweh respected Abel and his offering ,
but he didn 't respect Cain and his offering . Cain was very angry , and the expression on his face fell .
Yahweh said to Cain , " Why are you angry ? why has the expression of your face fallen ?
if you do well , will it not be lifted up ? if you don 't do well , sin crouches at the door . its desire is for you , but you are to rule over it . "
Cain said to Abel , his brother , " Let 's go into the field . " it happened when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel , his brother , and killed him .
Yahweh said to Cain , " Where is Abel , your brother ? " he said , " I don 't know . am I my brother 's keeper ? "
Yahweh said , " What have you done ? the voice of your brother 's blood cries to me from the ground .
now you are Cursed because of the ground , which has opened its mouth to receive your brother 's blood from your hand .
from now on , when you till the ground , it won 't yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . "
Cain said to Yahweh , " My punishment is greater than I can bear .
behold , you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground . I will be hidden from your face , and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me . "
Yahweh said to him , " Therefore whoever slays Cain , vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold . " Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain , lest any finding him should strike him .
Cain went out from Yahweh 's presence , and lived in the land of nod , east of Eden .
Cain knew his wife . she conceived , and gave birth to Enoch . he built a city , and called the name of the city , after the name of his son , Enoch .
to Enoch was born Irad . Irad became the father of Mehujael . Mehujael became the father of Methushael . Methushael became the father of Lamech .
Lamech took two wives : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other Zillah .
Adah gave birth to Jabal , who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock .
his brother 's name was Jubal , who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe .
Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain , the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron . Tubal Cain 's sister was Naamah .
if Cain will be avenged seven times , truly Lamech seventy @-@ seven times . "
there was also born a son to Seth , and he named him Enosh . then men began to call on Yahweh 's name .
this is the book of the generations of Adam . in the day that God created man , he made him in God 's likeness .
he created them male and female , and blessed them , and called their name " Adam , " in the day when they were created .
Adam lived one hundred thirty years , and became the father of a son in his own likeness , after his image , and named him Seth .
the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years , and he became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years , then he died .
Seth lived one hundred five years , and became the father of Enosh .
Seth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred seven years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years , then he died .
Enosh lived ninety years , and became the father of Kenan .
Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan , eight hundred fifteen years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years , then he died .
Kenan lived seventy years , and became the father of Mahalalel .
Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years , and became the father of sons and daughters
and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years , then he died .
Mahalalel lived sixty @-@ five years , and became the father of Jared .
Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred thirty years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety @-@ five years , then he died .
Jared lived one hundred sixty @-@ two years , and became the father of Enoch .
Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty @-@ two years , then he died .
Enoch lived sixty @-@ five years , and became the father of Methuselah .
Enoch walked with God after he became the father of Methuselah three hundred years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty @-@ five years .
Enoch walked with God , and he was not , for God took him .
Methuselah lived one hundred eighty @-@ seven years , and became the father of Lamech .
Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty @-@ two years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty @-@ nine years , then he died .
Lamech lived one hundred eighty @-@ two years , and became the father of a son ,
and he named him Noah , saying , " This same will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands , because of the ground which Yahweh has Cursed . "
Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred ninety @-@ five years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy @-@ seven years , then he died .
Noah was five hundred years old , and Noah became the father of Shem , ham , and Japheth .
it happened , when men began to multiply on the surface of the ground , and daughters were born to them ,
that God 's sons saw that men 's daughters were beautiful , and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose .
Yahweh said , " My Spirit will not strive with man forever , because he also is flesh ; yet will his days be one hundred twenty years . "
Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him in his heart .
Yahweh said , " I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground ; man , along with animals , creeping things , and birds of the sky ; for I am sorry that I have made them . "
but Noah found favor in Yahweh 's eyes .
this is the history of the generations of Noah . Noah was a righteous man , blameless among the people of his time . Noah walked with God .
Noah became the father of three sons : Shem , ham , and Japheth .
the earth was corrupt before God , and the earth was filled with violence .
God saw the earth , and saw that it was corrupt , for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth .
God said to Noah , " The end of all flesh has come before me , for the earth is filled with violence through them . behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
make a ship of gopher wood . you shall make rooms in the ship , and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch .
this is how you shall make it . the length of the ship will be three hundred cubits , its breadth fifty cubits , and its height thirty cubits .
you shall make a roof in the ship , and you shall finish it to a cubit upward . you shall set the door of the ship in its side . you shall make it with lower , second , and third levels .
I , even I , do bring the flood of waters on this earth , to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky . everything that is in the earth will die .
but I will establish my Covenant with you . you shall come into the ship , you , your sons , your wife , and your sons ' wives with you .
of every living thing of all flesh , you shall bring two of every sort into the ship , to keep them alive with you . they shall be male and female .
of the birds after their kind , of the livestock after their kind , of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind , two of every sort shall come to you , to keep them alive .
take with you of all food that is eaten , and gather it to yourself ; and it will be for food for you , and for them . "
thus Noah did . according to all that God commanded him , so he did .
Yahweh said to Noah , " Come with all of your household into the ship , for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation .
you shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you , the male and his female . of the animals that are not clean , take two , the male and his female .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the surface of the ground . "
Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him .
Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth .
Noah went into the ship with his sons , his wife , and his sons ' wives , because of the waters of the flood .
clean animals , animals that are not clean , birds , and everything that creeps on the ground
it happened after the seven days , that the waters of the flood came on the earth .
in the six hundredth year of Noah 's life , in the second month , on the seventeenth day of the month , on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open , and the sky 's windows were opened .
the rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights .
in the same day Noah , and Shem , ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , entered into the ship ;
they , and every animal after its kind , all the livestock after their kind , every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind , and every bird after its kind , every bird of every sort .
they went to Noah into the ship , by pairs of all flesh with the breath of life in them .
those who went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God commanded him ; and Yahweh shut him in .
the flood was forty days on the earth . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the earth .
the waters prevailed , and increased greatly on the earth ; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters .
the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth . all the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered .
the waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward , and the mountains were covered .
all flesh died that moved on the earth , including birds , livestock , animals , every creeping thing that creeps on the earth , and every man .
every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground , including man , livestock , creeping things , and birds of the sky . they were destroyed from the earth . only Noah was left , and those who were with him in the ship .
God remembered Noah , all the animals , and all the livestock that were with him in the ship ; and God made a wind to pass over the earth . the waters subsided .
the deep 's fountains and the sky 's windows were also stopped , and the rain from the sky was restrained .
the waters receded from the earth continually . after the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased .
the ship rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , on Ararat 's mountains .
the waters receded continually until the tenth month . in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , the tops of the mountains were seen .
it happened at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made ,
and he sent out a raven . it went back and forth , until the waters were dried up from the earth .
he sent out a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground ,
he stayed yet another seven days ; and again he sent the dove out of the ship .
the dove came back to him at evening , and , behold , in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off . so Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth .
he stayed yet another seven days , and sent out the dove ; and she didn 't return to him any more .
it happened in the six hundred first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dried up from the earth . Noah removed the covering of the ship , and looked . he saw that the surface of the ground was dried .
in the second month , on the twenty @-@ seventh day of the month , the earth was dry .
God spoke to Noah , saying ,
bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh , including birds , livestock , and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth , that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply on the earth . "
Noah went out , with his sons , his wife , and his sons ' wives with him .
every animal , every creeping thing , and every bird , whatever moves on the earth , after their families , went out of the ship .
Noah built an altar to Yahweh , and took of every clean animal , and of every clean bird , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
while the earth remains , seed time and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease . "
God blessed Noah and his sons , and said to them , " Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth .
the fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth , and on every bird of the sky . everything that the ground teems with , and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand .
every moving thing that lives will be food for you . as the green herb , I have given everything to you .
but flesh with its life , its blood , you shall not eat .
I will surely require your blood of your lives . at the hand of every animal I will require it . at the hand of man , even at the hand of every man 's brother , I will require the life of man .
whoever sheds man 's blood , his blood will be shed by man , for God made man in his own image .
be fruitful and multiply . increase abundantly in the earth , and multiply in it . "
God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him , saying ,
" as for me , behold , I establish my Covenant with you , and with your offspring after you ,
I will establish my Covenant with you : all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood , neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth . "
God said , " This is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you , for perpetual generations :
I set my rainbow in the cloud , and it will be for a sign of a Covenant between me and the earth .
it will happen , when I bring a cloud over the earth , that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud ,
and I will remember my Covenant , which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh , and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
the rainbow will be in the cloud . I will look at it , that I may remember the everlasting Covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth . "
God said to Noah , " This is the token of the Covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth . "
the sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem , ham , and Japheth . ham is the father of Canaan .
Noah began to be a farmer , and planted a vineyard .
he drank of the wine and got drunk . he was uncovered within his tent .
ham , the father of Canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brothers outside .
Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it on both their shoulders , went in backwards , and covered the nakedness of their father . their faces were backwards , and they didn 't see their father 's nakedness .
Noah awoke from his wine , and knew what his youngest son had done to him .
he said , " Canaan is Cursed . he will be servant of servants to his brothers . "
he said , " blessed be Yahweh , the God of Shem . let Canaan be his servant .
May God enlarge Japheth . let him dwell in the tents of Shem . let Canaan be his servant . "
Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood .
all the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years , then he died .
now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem , ham , and Japheth . sons were born to them after the flood .
the sons of Japheth : Gomer , Magog , Madai , Javan , Tubal , Meshech , and Tiras .
the sons of Gomer : Ashkenaz , Riphath , and Togarmah .
the sons of Javan : Elishah , Tarshish , Kittim , and Dodanim .
of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands , everyone after his language , after their families , in their nations .
the sons of ham : Cush , Mizraim , Put , and Canaan .
Cush became the father of Nimrod . he began to be a mighty one in the earth .
he was a mighty hunter before Yahweh . therefore it is said , " Like Nimrod , a mighty hunter before Yahweh . "
the beginning of his kingdom was Babel , Erech , Accad , and Calneh , in the land of Shinar .
out of that land he went into Assyria , and built Nineveh , Rehoboth Ir , Calah ,
Mizraim became the father of Ludim , Anamim , Lehabim , Naphtuhim ,
Canaan became the father of Sidon ( his firstborn ) , Heth ,
the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as you go toward Gerar , to Gaza ; as you go toward Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboiim , to Lasha .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , in their nations .
to Shem , the father of all the children of Eber , the elder brother of Japheth , to him also were children born .
the sons of Aram : Uz , Hul , Gether , and Mash .
to Eber were born two sons . the name of the one was Peleg , for in his days the earth was divided . his brother 's name was Joktan .
their dwelling was from Mesha , as you go toward Sephar , the mountain of the east .
these are the sons of Shem , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , after their nations .
these are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations . of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
the whole earth was of one language and of one speech .
it happened , as they traveled east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar , and they lived there .
they said one to another , " Come , let 's make bricks , and burn them thoroughly . " they had brick for stone , and they used tar for mortar .
they said , " Come , let 's build ourselves a city , and a tower whose top reaches to the sky , and let 's make ourselves a name , lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth . "
Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower , which the children of men built .
Yahweh said , " behold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be withheld from them , which they intend to do .
come , let 's go down , and there confuse their language , that they may not understand one another 's speech . "
so Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth . they stopped building the city .
therefore its name was called Babel , because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth . from there , Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth .
this is the history of the generations of Shem . Shem was one hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood .
Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Arpachshad lived thirty @-@ five years and became the father of Shelah .
Shelah lived thirty years , and became the father of Eber :
and Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Eber lived thirty @-@ four years , and became the father of Peleg .
Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Peleg lived thirty years , and became the father of Reu .
Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Reu lived thirty @-@ two years , and became the father of Serug .
Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Serug lived thirty years , and became the father of Nahor .
Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Nahor lived twenty @-@ nine years , and became the father of Terah .
Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Terah lived seventy years , and became the father of Abram , Nahor , and Haran .
now this is the history of the generations of Terah . Terah became the father of Abram , Nahor , and Haran . Haran became the father of lot .
Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth , in Ur of the Chaldees .
Abram and Nahor took wives . the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai , and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah .
Sarai was barren . she had no child .
Terah took Abram his son , lot the son of Haran , his son 's son , and Sarai his daughter @-@ in @-@ law , his son Abram 's wife . they went from Ur of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Canaan . they came to Haran and lived there .
the days of Terah were two hundred five years . Terah died in Haran .
now Yahweh said to Abram , " Get out of your country , and from your relatives , and from your father 's house , to the land that I will show you .
I will make of you a great nation . I will bless you and make your name great . you will be a blessing .
I will bless those who bless you , and I will curse him who curses you . all of the families of the earth will be blessed in you . "
so Abram went , as Yahweh had spoken to him . lot went with him . Abram was seventy @-@ five years old when he departed out of Haran .
Abram took Sarai his wife , lot his brother 's son , all their substance that they had gathered , and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran , and they went to go into the land of Canaan . into the land of Canaan they came .
Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem , to the oak of Moreh . the Canaanite was then in the land .
Yahweh appeared to Abram and said , " I will give this land to your seed . " he built an altar there to Yahweh , who appeared to him .
he left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel , and pitched his tent , having Bethel on the west , and AI on the east . there he built an altar to Yahweh and called on the name of Yahweh .
Abram traveled , going on still toward the South .
there was a famine in the land . Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there , for the famine was severe in the land .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sarai his wife , " See now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
it will happen , when the Egyptians will see you , that they will say , ' This is his wife . ' they will kill me , but they will save you alive .
please say that you are my sister , that it may be well with me for your sake , and that my soul may live because of you . "
it happened that when Abram had come into Egypt , the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful .
the princes of Pharaoh saw her , and praised her to Pharaoh ; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh 's house .
he dealt well with Abram for her sake . he had sheep , cattle , male donkeys , male servants , female servants , female donkeys , and camels .
Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai , Abram 's wife .
Pharaoh called Abram and said , " What is this that you have done to me ? why didn 't you tell me that she was your wife ?
why did you say , ' She is my sister , ' so that I took her to be my wife ? now therefore , see your wife , take her , and go your way . "
Pharaoh commanded men concerning him , and they brought him on the way with his wife and all that he had .
Abram went up out of Egypt : he , his wife , all that he had , and lot with him , into the South .
Abram was very rich in livestock , in silver , and in gold .
he went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel , to the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Bethel and AI ,
to the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first . there Abram called on the name of Yahweh .
lot also , who went with Abram , had flocks , and herds , and tents .
the land was not able to bear them , that they might live together : for their substance was great , so that they could not live together .
there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram 's livestock and the herdsmen of lot 's livestock : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time .
Abram said to lot , " Please , let there be no strife between me and you , and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen ; for we are relatives .
Isn 't the whole land before you ? please separate yourself from me . if you go to the left hand , then I will go to the right . or if you go to the right hand , then I will go to the left . "
so lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself . lot traveled east , and they separated themselves the one from the other .
Abram lived in the land of Canaan , and lot lived in the cities of the plain , and moved his tent as far as Sodom .
now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh .
Yahweh said to Abram , after lot was separated from him , " Now , lift up your eyes , and look from the place where you are , northward and southward and eastward and westward ,
for all the land which you see , I will give to you , and to your offspring forever .
I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth , so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then your seed may also be numbered .
arise , walk through the land in its length and in its breadth ; for I will give it to you . "
Abram moved his tent , and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre , which are in Hebron , and built an altar there to Yahweh .
it happened in the days of Amraphel , king of Shinar , Arioch , king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer , king of Elam , and tidal , king of Goiim ,
that they made war with Bera , king of Sodom , and with Birsha , king of Gomorrah , Shinab , king of Admah , and Shemeber , king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( the same is Zoar ) .
all these joined together in the valley of Siddim ( the same is the Salt Sea ) .
twelve years they served Chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth year , they rebelled .
they returned , and came to En Mishpat ( the same is Kadesh ) , and struck all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites , that lived in Hazazon Tamar .
now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits ; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , and they fell there , and those who remained fled to the hills .
they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their food , and went their way .
they took lot , Abram 's brother 's son , who lived in Sodom , and his goods , and departed .
one who had escaped came and told Abram , the Hebrew . now he lived by the oaks of Mamre , the Amorite , brother of Eshcol , and brother of Aner ; and these were allies of Abram .
when Abram heard that his relative was taken captive , he led out his trained men , born in his house , three hundred and Eighteen , and pursued as far as Dan .
he divided himself against them by night , he and his servants , and struck them , and pursued them to Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
he brought back all the goods , and also brought back his relative , lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
the king of Sodom went out to meet him , after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him , at the valley of Shaveh ( that is , the King 's Valley ) .
Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine : and he was priest of God Most High .
he blessed him , and said , " blessed be Abram of God Most High , possessor of heaven and earth :
and blessed be God Most High , who has delivered your enemies into your hand . " Abram gave him a tenth of all .
the king of Sodom said to Abram , " Give me the people , and take the goods to yourself . "
I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men who went with me : Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre . let them take their portion . "
after these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision , saying , " Don 't be afraid , Abram . I am your shield , your exceedingly great reward . "
Abram said , " Lord Yahweh , what will you give me , since I go childless , and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus ? "
Abram said , " behold , to me you have given no seed : and , behold , one born in my house is my heir . "
behold , the word of Yahweh came to him , saying , " This man will not be your heir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir . "
Yahweh brought him outside , and said , " Look now toward the sky , and count the stars , if you are able to count them . " he said to Abram , " So shall your seed be . "
he believed in Yahweh ; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness .
he said to him , " I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees , to give you this land to inherit it . "
he said , " Lord Yahweh , how will I know that I will inherit it ? "
he said to him , " Bring me a heifer three years old , a female goat three years old , a ram three years old , a turtledove , and a young pigeon . "
he brought him all of these , and divided them in the middle , and laid each half opposite the other ; but he didn 't divide the birds .
the birds of prey came down on the carcasses , and Abram drove them away .
when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell on Abram . now terror and great darkness fell on him .
he said to Abram , " Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs , and will serve them . they will afflict them four hundred years .
I will also judge that nation , whom they will serve . afterward they will come out with great wealth ,
but you will go to your fathers in peace . you will be buried in a good old age .
in the fourth generation they will come here again , for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full . "
it came to pass that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold , a smoking furnace , and a flaming torch passed between these pieces .
now Sarai , Abram 's wife , bore him no children . she had a handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
Sarai , Abram 's wife , took Hagar the Egyptian , her handmaid , after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife .
he went in to Hagar , and she conceived . when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
but Abram said to Sarai , " behold , your maid is in your hand . do to her whatever is good in your eyes . " Sarai dealt harshly with her , and she fled from her face .
the angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
he said , " Hagar , Sarai 's handmaid , where did you come from ? where are you going ? " she said , " I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai . "
the angel of Yahweh said to her , " Return to your mistress , and submit yourself under her hands . "
the angel of Yahweh said to her , " I will greatly multiply your seed , that they will not be numbered for multitude . "
the angel of Yahweh said to her , " behold , you are with child , and will bear a son . you shall call his name Ishmael , because Yahweh has heard your affliction .
she called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her , " You are a God who sees , " for she said , " Have I even stayed alive after seeing him ? "
therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi . behold , it is between Kadesh and Bered .
Hagar bore a son for Abram . Abram called the name of his son , whom Hagar bore , Ishmael .
Abram was eighty @-@ six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram .
when Abram was ninety @-@ nine years old , Yahweh appeared to Abram , and said to him , " I am God Almighty . walk before me , and be blameless .
I will make my Covenant between me and you , and will multiply you exceedingly . "
Abram fell on his face . God talked with him , saying ,
" as for me , behold , my Covenant is with you . you will be the father of a multitude of nations .
neither will your name any more be called Abram , but your name will be Abraham ; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations .
I will make you exceedingly fruitful , and I will make nations of you . Kings will come out of you .
I will establish my Covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting Covenant , to be a God to you and to your seed after you .
God said to Abraham , " As for you , you will keep my Covenant , you and your seed after you throughout their generations .
this is my Covenant , which you shall keep , between me and you and your seed after you . every male among you shall be circumcised .
you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin . it will be a token of the Covenant between me and you .
he who is born in your house , and he who is bought with your money , must be circumcised . my Covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting Covenant .
the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin , that soul shall be cut off from his people . he has broken my Covenant . "
God said to Abraham , " As for Sarai your wife , you shall not call her name Sarai , but her name will be Sarah .
I will bless her , and moreover I will give you a son by her . yes , I will bless her , and she will be a mother of nations . Kings of peoples will come from her . "
then Abraham fell on his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , " Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old ? will Sarah , who is ninety years old , give birth ? "
Abraham said to God , " Oh that Ishmael might live before you ! "
God said , " No , but Sarah , your wife , will bear you a son . you shall call his name Isaac . I will establish my Covenant with him for an everlasting Covenant for his seed after him .
as for Ishmael , I have heard you . behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly . he will become the father of twelve princes , and I will make him a great nation .
but my Covenant I establish with Isaac , whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year . "
when he finished talking with him , God went up from Abraham .
Abraham took Ishmael his son , all who were born in his house , and all who were bought with his money ; every male among the men of Abraham 's house , and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day , as God had said to him .
in the same day both Abraham and Ishmael , his son , were circumcised .
all the men of his house , those born in the house , and those bought with money of a foreigner , were circumcised with him .
Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre , as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day .
he lifted up his eyes and looked , and saw that three men stood opposite him . when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bowed himself to the earth ,
and said , " My lord , if now I have found favor in your sight , please don 't go away from your servant .
now let a little water be fetched , wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree .
Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah , and said , " quickly prepare three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes . "
Abraham ran to the herd , and fetched a tender and good calf , and gave it to the servant . he hurried to dress it .
he took butter , milk , and the calf which he had dressed , and set it before them . he stood by them under the tree , and they ate .
they asked him , " Where is Sarah , your wife ? " he said , " See , in the tent . "
he said , " I will certainly return to you when the season comes round . behold , Sarah your wife will have a son . " Sarah heard in the tent door , which was behind him .
now Abraham and Sarah were old , well advanced in age . Sarah had passed the age of childbearing .
Sarah laughed within herself , saying , " After I have grown old will I have pleasure , my lord being old also ? "
Yahweh said to Abraham , " Why did Sarah laugh , saying , ' Will I really bear a child , yet I am old ? '
is anything too hard for Yahweh ? at the set time I will return to you , when the season comes round , and Sarah will have a son . "
then Sarah denied , saying , " I didn 't laugh , " for she was afraid . he said , " No , but you did laugh . "
the men rose up from there , and looked toward Sodom . Abraham went with them to see them on their way .
Yahweh said , " Will I hide from Abraham what I do ,
since Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him ?
Yahweh said , " Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great , and because their sin is very grievous ,
I will go down now , and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me . if not , I will know . "
the men turned from there , and went toward Sodom , but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh .
Abraham drew near , and said , " Will you consume the righteous with the wicked ?
what if there are fifty righteous within the city ? will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it ?
Yahweh said , " If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their sake . "
Abraham answered , " See now , I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord , who am but dust and ashes .
he spoke to him yet again , and said , " What if there are forty found there ? " he said , " I will not do it for the forty 's sake . "
he said , " Oh don 't let the Lord be angry , and I will speak . what if there are thirty found there ? " he said , " I will not do it , if I find thirty there . "
Yahweh went his way , as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham , and Abraham returned to his place .
the two angels came to Sodom at evening . lot sat in the gate of Sodom . lot saw them , and rose up to meet them . he bowed himself with his face to the earth ,
he urged them greatly , and they came in with him , and entered into his house . he made them a feast , and baked unleavened bread , and they ate .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of Sodom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter .
they called to lot , and said to him , " Where are the men who came in to you this night ? bring them out to us , that we may have sex with them . "
lot went out to them to the door , and shut the door after him .
he said , " Please , my brothers , don 't act so wickedly .
but the men reached out their hand , and brought lot into the house to them , and shut the door .
they struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great , so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
for we will destroy this place , because the outcry against them has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it . "
but he lingered ; and the men grabbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two daughters ' hands , Yahweh being merciful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
lot said to them , " Oh , not so , my lord .
see now , your servant has found favor in your sight , and you have magnified your loving kindness , which you have shown to me in saving my life . I can 't escape to the mountain , lest evil overtake me , and I die .
see now , this city is near to flee to , and it is a little one . Oh let me escape there ( isn 't it a little one ? ) , and my soul will live . "
he said to him , " behold , I have granted your request concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken .
hurry , escape there , for I can 't do anything until you get there . " therefore the name of the city was called Zoar .
the sun had risen on the earth when lot came to Zoar .
then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky .
he overthrew those cities , all the plain , all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew on the ground .
but his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh .
he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in which lot lived .
lot went up out of Zoar , and lived in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he was afraid to live in Zoar . he lived in a cave with his two daughters .
the firstborn said to the younger , " Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth .
come , let 's make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve our father 's seed . "
they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father . he didn 't know when she lay down , nor when she arose .
they made their father drink wine that night also . the younger went and lay with him . he didn 't know when she lay down , nor when she got up .
thus both of lot 's daughters were with child by their father .
the firstborn bore a son , and named him Moab . he is the father of the Moabites to this day .
the younger also bore a son , and called his name Ben Ammi . he is the father of the children of Ammon to this day .
Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South , and lived between Kadesh and Shur . he lived as a foreigner in Gerar .
Abraham said about Sarah his wife , " She is my sister . " Abimelech king of Gerar sent , and took Sarah .
but God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night , and said to him , " behold , you are a dead man , because of the woman whom you have taken . for she is a man 's wife . "
now Abimelech had not come near her . he said , " Lord , will you kill even a righteous nation ?
Abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ear . the men were very scared .
Abimelech said to Abraham , " What did you see , that you have done this thing ? "
Abraham said , " Because I thought , ' surely the fear of God is not in this place . they will kill me for my wife 's sake . '
besides , she is indeed my sister , the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
it happened , when God caused me to wander from my father 's house , that I said to her , ' This is your kindness which you shall show to me . everywhere that we go , say of me , " He is my brother . " ' "
Abimelech took sheep and cattle , male servants and female servants , and gave them to Abraham , and restored Sarah , his wife , to him .
Abimelech said , " behold , my land is before you . dwell where it pleases you . "
Abraham prayed to God . God healed Abimelech , and his wife , and his female servants , and they bore children .
for Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech , because of Sarah , Abraham 's wife .
Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said , and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken .
Sarah conceived , and bore Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
Abraham called his son who was born to him , whom Sarah bore to him , Isaac .
Abraham circumcised his son , Isaac , when he was eight days old , as God had commanded him .
Sarah said , " God has made me laugh . everyone who hears will laugh with me . "
she said , " Who would have said to Abraham , that Sarah would nurse children ? for I have borne him a son in his old age . "
the child grew , and was weaned . Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned .
Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian , whom she had borne to Abraham , mocking .
therefore she said to Abraham , " cast out this handmaid and her son ! for the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son , Isaac . "
God said to Abraham , " Don 't let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy , and because of your handmaid . in all that Sarah says to you , listen to her voice . for from Isaac will your seed be called .
I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid , because he is your seed . "
the water in the bottle was spent , and she cast the child under one of the shrubs .
she went and sat down opposite him , a good way off , about a bow shot away . for she said , " Don 't let me see the death of the child . " she sat over against him , and lifted up her voice , and wept .
God heard the voice of the boy . the angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky , and said to her , " What ails you , Hagar ? Don 't be afraid . for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is .
get up , lift up the boy , and hold him in your hand . for I will make him a great nation . "
God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water . she went , filled the bottle with water , and gave the boy drink .
God was with the boy , and he grew . he lived in the wilderness , and became , as he grew up , an archer .
he lived in the wilderness of Paran . his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
it happened at that time , that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham , saying , " God is with you in all that you do .
Abraham said , " I will swear . "
Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well , which Abimelech 's servants had violently taken away .
Abimelech said , " I don 't know who has done this thing . you didn 't tell me , neither did I hear of it , until today . "
Abraham took sheep and cattle , and gave them to Abimelech . those two made a Covenant .
Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
Abimelech said to Abraham , " What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean ? "
he said , " You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand , that it may be a witness to me , that I have dug this well . "
therefore he called that place Beersheba , because they both swore there .
so they made a Covenant at Beersheba . Abimelech rose up with Phicol , the captain of his army , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba , and called there on the name of Yahweh , the Everlasting God .
Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days .
it happened after these things , that God tested Abraham , and said to him , " Abraham ! " he said , " Here I am . "
he said , " Now take your son , your only son , whom you love , even Isaac , and go into the land of Moriah . offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of . "
Abraham rose early in the morning , and saddled his donkey , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son . he split the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went to the place of which God had told him .
on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place far off .
Abraham said to his young men , " Stay here with the donkey . the boy and I will go yonder . we will worship , and come back to you . "
Abraham said , " God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering , my son . " so they both went together .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Abraham built the altar there , and laid the wood in order , bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar , on the wood .
Abraham stretched out his hand , and took the knife to kill his son .
the angel of Yahweh called to him out of the sky , and said , " Abraham , Abraham ! " he said , " Here I am . "
he said , " Don 't lay your hand on the boy , neither do anything to him . for now I know that you fear God , since you have not withheld your son , your only son , from me . "
Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns . Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son .
Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide . as it is said to this day , " On Yahweh 's mountain , it will be provided . "
the angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time out of the sky ,
and said , " I have sworn by myself , says Yahweh , because you have done this thing , and have not withheld your son , your only son ,
that I will bless you greatly , and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens , and like the sand which is on the seashore . your seed will possess the gate of his enemies .
in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed , because you have obeyed my voice . "
so Abraham returned to his young men , and they rose up and went together to Beersheba . Abraham lived at Beersheba .
it happened after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , " behold , Milcah , she also has borne children to your brother Nahor :
Uz his firstborn , Buz his brother , Kemuel the father of Aram ,
Bethuel became the father of Rebekah . these eight Milcah bore to Nahor , Abraham 's brother .
his concubine , whose name was Reumah , also bore Tebah , Gaham , Tahash , and Maacah .
Sarah lived one hundred twenty @-@ seven years . this was the length of Sarah 's life .
Sarah died in Kiriath Arba ( the same is Hebron ) , in the land of Canaan . Abraham came to mourn for Sarah , and to weep for her .
Abraham rose up from before his dead , and spoke to the children of Heth , saying ,
" I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you . give me a possession of a burying @-@ place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight . "
Abraham rose up , and bowed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of Heth .
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which he has , which is in the end of his field . for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying @-@ place . "
now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth . Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
" no , my lord , hear me . I give you the field , and I give you the cave that is in it . in the presence of the children of my people I give it to you . bury your dead . "
Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land .
Abraham listened to Ephron . Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , according to the current merchants ' standard .
after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre ( that is , Hebron ) , in the land of Canaan .
the field , and the cave that is in it , were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth .
Abraham was old , and well stricken in age . Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things .
Abraham said to his servant , the elder of his house , who ruled over all that he had , " Please put your hand under my thigh .
I will make you swear by Yahweh , the God of heaven and the God of the earth , that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I live .
but you shall go to my country , and to my relatives , and take a wife for my son Isaac . "
the servant said to him , " What if the woman isn 't willing to follow me to this land ? must I bring your son again to the land you came from ? "
Abraham said to him , " beware that you don 't bring my son there again .
if the woman isn 't willing to follow you , then you shall be clear from this my oath . only you shall not bring my son there again . "
the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and swore to him concerning this matter .
the servant took ten camels , of his master 's camels , and departed , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , to the city of Nahor .
he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening , the time that women go out to draw water .
he said , " Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , please give me success this day , and show kindness to my master Abraham .
behold , I am standing by the spring of water . the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother , with her pitcher on her shoulder .
the young lady was very beautiful to look at , a virgin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pitcher , and came up .
the servant ran to meet her , and said , " Please give me a drink , a little water from your pitcher . "
she said , " Drink , my lord . " she hurried , and let down her pitcher on her hand , and gave him drink .
when she had done giving him drink , she said , " I will also draw for your camels , until they have done drinking . "
she hurried , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again to the well to draw , and drew for all his camels .
the man looked steadfastly at her , remaining silent , to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not .
it happened , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ,
and said , " whose daughter are you ? please tell me . is there room in your father 's house for us to lodge in ? "
she said to him , " I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah , whom she bore to Nahor . "
she said moreover to him , " We have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in . "
the man bowed his head , and worshiped Yahweh .
he said , " blessed be Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master . as for me , Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of my master 's relatives . "
the young lady ran , and told her mother 's house about these words .
Rebekah had a brother , and his name was Laban . Laban ran out to the man , to the spring .
he said , " Come in , you blessed of Yahweh . why do you stand outside ? for I have prepared the house , and room for the camels . "
the man came into the house , and he unloaded the camels . he gave straw and provender for the camels , and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him .
food was set before him to eat , but he said , " I will not eat until I have told my message . " he said , " Speak on . "
he said , " I am Abraham 's servant .
Yahweh has blessed my master greatly . he has become great . he has given him flocks and herds , silver and gold , male servants and female servants , and camels and donkeys .
Sarah , my master 's wife , bore a son to my master when she was old . he has given all that he has to him .
he said to me , ' Yahweh , before whom I walk , will send his angel with you , and prosper your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
then will you be clear from my oath , when you come to my relatives . if they don 't give her to you , you shall be clear from my oath . '
I came this day to the spring , and said , ' Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , if now you do prosper my way which I go--
behold , I am standing by this spring of water . let it happen , that the maiden who comes out to draw , to whom I will say , " Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink , "
and she will tell me , " Drink , and I will also draw for your camels , " --let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master 's son . '
before I had finished speaking in my heart , behold , Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder . she went down to the spring , and drew . I said to her , ' Please let me drink . '
she hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , ' Drink , and I will also give your camels a drink . ' so I drank , and she also gave the camels a drink .
I asked her , and said , ' whose daughter are you ? ' she said , ' The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor 's son , whom Milcah bore to him . ' I put the ring on her nose , and the bracelets on her hands .
I bowed my head , and worshiped Yahweh , and blessed Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , who had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter for his son .
now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me . if not , tell me , that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left . "
then Laban and Bethuel answered , " The thing proceeds from Yahweh . we can 't speak to you bad or good .
behold , Rebekah is before you . take her , and go , and let her be your master 's son 's wife , as Yahweh has spoken . "
it happened that when Abraham 's servant heard their words , he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh .
the servant brought out jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing , and gave them to Rebekah . he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother .
they ate and drank , he and the men who were with him , and stayed all night . they rose up in the morning , and he said , " Send me away to my master . "
her brother and her mother said , " Let the young lady stay with us a few days , at least ten . after that she will go . "
he said to them , " Don 't hinder me , since Yahweh has prospered my way . send me away that I may go to my master . "
they said , " We will call the young lady , and ask her . "
they called Rebekah , and said to her , " Will you go with this man ? " she said , " I will go . "
they sent away Rebekah , their sister , with her nurse , Abraham 's servant , and his men .
they blessed Rebekah , and said to her , " Our sister , may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands , and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them . "
Rebekah arose with her ladies . they rode on the camels , and followed the man . the servant took Rebekah , and went his way .
Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi , for he lived in the land of the South .
Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , there were camels coming .
Rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac , she dismounted from the Camel .
she said to the servant , " Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us ? " the servant said , " It is my master . " she took her veil , and covered herself .
the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done .
Abraham took another wife , and her name was Keturah .
she bore him Zimran , Jokshan , Medan , Midian , Ishbak , and Shuah .
Jokshan became the father of Sheba , and Dedan . the sons of Dedan were Asshurim , Letushim , and Leummim .
the sons of Midian : Ephah , Epher , Hanoch , Abida , and Eldaah . all these were the children of Keturah .
Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac ,
but to the sons of Abraham 's concubines , Abraham gave gifts . he sent them away from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , eastward , to the east country .
these are the days of the years of Abraham 's life which he lived : one hundred seventy @-@ five years .
Abraham gave up the spirit , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac and Ishmael , his sons , buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron , the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ,
the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth . Abraham was buried there with Sarah , his wife .
it happened after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac , his son . Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi .
now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's handmaid , bore to Abraham .
these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebaioth , then Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
Hadad , TEMA , Jetur , Naphish , and Kedemah .
these are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their encampments : twelve princes , according to their nations .
these are the years of the life of Ishmael : one hundred thirty @-@ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
they lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt , as you go toward Assyria . he lived opposite all his relatives .
Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram , the sister of Laban the Syrian , to be his wife .
Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife , because she was barren . Yahweh was entreated by him , and Rebekah his wife conceived .
the children struggled together within her . she said , " If it be so , why do I live ? " she went to inquire of Yahweh .
Yahweh said to her , " Two nations are in your womb . two peoples will be separated from your body . the one people will be stronger than the other people . the elder will serve the younger . "
when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
the first came out red all over , like a hairy garment . they named him Esau .
after that , his brother came out , and his hand had hold on Esau 's heel . he was named Jacob . Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them .
the boys grew . Esau was a skillful hunter , a man of the field . Jacob was a quiet man , living in tents .
now Isaac loved Esau , because he ate his venison . Rebekah loved Jacob .
Jacob boiled stew . Esau came in from the field , and he was famished .
Esau said to Jacob , " Please feed me with that same red stew , for I am famished . " therefore his name was called Edom .
Esau said , " behold , I am about to die . what good is the birthright to me ? "
Jacob said , " swear to me first . " he swore to him . he sold his birthright to Jacob .
Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils . he ate and drank , rose up , and went his way . so Esau despised his birthright .
there was a famine in the land , besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham . Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines , to Gerar .
Yahweh appeared to him , and said , " Don 't go down into Egypt . live in the land I will tell you about .
live in this land , and I will be with you , and will bless you . for to you , and to your seed , I will give all these lands , and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father .
I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky , and will give to your seed all these lands . in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed ,
because Abraham obeyed my voice , and kept my requirements , my commandments , my statutes , and my laws . "
it happened , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was caressing Rebekah , his wife .
Abimelech said , " What is this you have done to us ? one of the people might easily have lain with your wife , and you would have brought guilt on us ! "
Abimelech commanded all the people , saying , " He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death . "
Isaac sowed in that land , and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted . Yahweh blessed him .
the man grew great , and grew more and more until he became very great .
he had possessions of flocks , possessions of herds , and a great household . the Philistines envied him .
now all the wells which his father 's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped , and filled with earth .
Abimelech said to Isaac , " Go from us , for you are much mightier than we . "
Isaac departed from there , encamped in the valley of Gerar , and lived there .
Isaac dug again the wells of water , which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father . for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham . he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
Isaac 's servants dug in the valley , and found there a well of springing water .
the herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac 's herdsmen , saying , " The water is ours . " he called the name of the well Esek , because they contended with him .
they dug another well , and they argued over that , also . he called its name Sitnah .
he went up from there to Beersheba .
Yahweh appeared to him the same night , and said , " I am the God of Abraham your father . Don 't be afraid , for I am with you , and will bless you , and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham 's sake . "
he built an altar there , and called on the name of Yahweh , and pitched his tent there . there Isaac 's servants dug a well .
then Abimelech went to him from Gerar , and Ahuzzath his friend , and Phicol the captain of his army .
Isaac said to them , " Why have you come to me , since you hate me , and have sent me away from you ? "
he made them a feast , and they ate and drank .
they rose up some time in the morning , and swore one to another . Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
it happened the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dug , and said to him , " We have found water . "
he called it Shibah . therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day .
when Esau was forty years old , he took as wife Judith , the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basemath , the daughter of Elon the Hittite .
they grieved Isaac 's and Rebekah 's spirits .
it happened , that when Isaac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called Esau his elder son , and said to him , " My son ? " he said to him , " Here I am . "
he said , " See now , I am old . I don 't know the day of my death .
now therefore , please take your weapons , your quiver and your bow , and go out to the field , and take me venison .
make me savory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my soul may bless you before I die . "
Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son . Esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son , saying , " behold , I heard your father speak to Esau your brother , saying ,
'Bring me venison , and make me savory food , that I may eat , and bless you before Yahweh before my death . '
now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command you .
go now to the flock , and get me from there two good young goats . I will make them savory food for your father , such as he loves .
you shall bring it to your father , that he may eat , so that he may bless you before his death . "
Jacob said to Rebekah his mother , " behold , Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am a smooth man .
what if my father touches me ? I will seem to him as a deceiver , and I would bring a curse on myself , and not a blessing . "
his mother said to him , " Let your curse be on me , my son . only obey my voice , and go get them for me . "
he went , and got them , and brought them to his mother . his mother made savory food , such as his father loved .
Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau , her elder son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob , her younger son .
she put the skins of the young goats on his hands , and on the smooth of his neck .
she gave the savory food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
he came to his father , and said , " My father ? " he said , " Here I am . who are you , my son ? "
Jacob said to his father , " I am Esau your firstborn . I have done what you asked me to do . please arise , sit and eat of my venison , that your soul may bless me . "
Isaac said to his son , " How is it that you have found it so quickly , my son ? " he said , " Because Yahweh your God gave me success . "
Isaac said to Jacob , " Please come near , that I may feel you , my son , whether you are really my son Esau or not . "
Jacob went near to Isaac his father . he felt him , and said , " The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau . "
he didn 't recognize him , because his hands were hairy , like his brother , Esau 's hands . so he blessed him .
he said , " Are you really my son Esau ? " he said , " I am . "
he said , " Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's venison , that my soul may bless you . " he brought it near to him , and he ate . he brought him wine , and he drank .
his father Isaac said to him , " Come near now , and kiss me , my son . "
he came near , and kissed him . he smelled the smell of his clothing , and blessed him , and said , " behold , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed .
God give you of the dew of the sky , of the fatness of the earth , and plenty of grain and new wine .
let peoples serve you , and nations bow down to you . be lord over your brothers . let your mother 's sons bow down to you . Cursed be everyone who curses you . blessed be everyone who blesses you . "
it happened , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
he also made savory food , and brought it to his father . he said to his father , " Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's venison , that your soul may bless me . "
Isaac his father said to him , " Who are you ? " he said , " I am your son , your firstborn , Esau . "
when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " bless me , even me also , my father . "
he said , " Your brother came with deceit , and has taken away your blessing . "
Isaac answered Esau , " behold , I have made him your lord , and all his brothers have I given to him for servants . with grain and new wine have I sustained him . what then will I do for you , my son ? "
Esau said to his father , " Have you but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , my father . " Esau lifted up his voice , and wept .
Isaac his father answered him , " behold , of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling , and of the dew of the sky from above .
by your sword will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck . "
the words of Esau , her elder son , were told to Rebekah . she sent and called Jacob , her younger son , and said to him , " behold , your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice . arise , flee to Laban , my brother , in Haran .
Isaac called Jacob , blessed him , and commanded him , " You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
arise , go to Paddan Aram , to the house of Bethuel your mother 's father . take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban , your mother 's brother .
May God Almighty bless you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , that you may be a company of peoples ,
and give you the blessing of Abraham , to you , and to your seed with you , that you may inherit the land where you travel , which God gave to Abraham . "
Isaac sent Jacob away . he went to Paddan Aram to Laban , son of Bethuel the Syrian , Rebekah 's brother , Jacob 's and Esau 's mother .
Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn 't please Isaac , his father .
Esau went to Ishmael , and took , besides the wives that he had , Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebaioth , to be his wife .
Jacob went out from Beersheba , and went toward Haran .
he came to a certain place , and stayed there all night , because the sun had set . he took one of the stones of the place , and put it under his head , and lay down in that place to sleep .
he dreamed . behold , a stairway set upon the earth , and its top reached to heaven . behold , the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
behold , Yahweh stood above it , and said , " I am Yahweh , the God of Abraham your father , and the God of Isaac . the land whereon you lie , to you will I give it , and to your seed .
your seed will be as the dust of the earth , and you will spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south . in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed .
behold , I am with you , and will keep you , wherever you go , and will bring you again into this land . for I will not leave you , until I have done that which I have spoken of to you . "
Jacob awakened out of his sleep , and he said , " surely Yahweh is in this place , and I didn 't know it . "
he was afraid , and said , " How dreadful is this place ! this is none other than God 's house , and this is the gate of heaven . "
Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil on its top .
he called the name of that place Bethel , but the name of the city was Luz at the first .
Jacob vowed a vow , saying , " If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and clothing to put on ,
so that I come again to my father 's house in peace , and Yahweh will be my God ,
then this stone , which I have set up for a pillar , will be God 's house . of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you . "
then Jacob went on his journey , and came to the land of the children of the east .
he looked , and behold , a well in the field , and , behold , three flocks of sheep lying there by it . for out of that well they watered the flocks . the stone on the well 's mouth was large .
there all the flocks were gathered . they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again on the well 's mouth in its place .
Jacob said to them , " My relatives , where are you from ? " they said , " We are from Haran . "
he said to them , " Do you know Laban , the son of Nahor ? " they said , " We know him . "
he said to them , " Is it well with him ? " they said , " It is well . see , Rachel , his daughter , is coming with the sheep . "
he said , " behold , it is still the middle of the day , not time to gather the livestock together . water the sheep , and go and feed them . "
they said , " We can 't , until all the flocks are gathered together , and they roll the stone from the well 's mouth . then we water the sheep . "
while he was yet speaking with them , Rachel came with her father 's sheep , for she kept them .
it happened , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban , his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Laban , his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the flock of Laban his mother 's brother .
Jacob kissed Rachel , and lifted up his voice , and wept .
Jacob told Rachel that he was her father 's brother , and that he was Rebekah 's son . she ran and told her father .
it happened , when Laban heard the news of Jacob , his sister 's son , that he ran to meet Jacob , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . Jacob told Laban all these things .
Laban said to him , " surely you are my bone and my flesh . " he lived with him for a month .
Laban said to Jacob , " Because you are my brother , should you therefore serve me for nothing ? tell me , what will your wages be ? "
Leah 's eyes were weak , but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive .
Jacob loved Rachel . he said , " I will serve you seven years for Rachel , your younger daughter . "
Laban said , " It is better that I give her to you , than that I should give her to another man . stay with me . "
Jacob served seven years for Rachel . they seemed to him but a few days , for the love he had for her .
Jacob said to Laban , " Give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in to her . "
Laban gathered together all the men of the place , and made a feast .
it happened in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him . he went in to her .
Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid .
Laban said , " It is not done so in our place , to give the younger before the firstborn .
fulfill the week of this one , and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years . "
Jacob did so , and fulfilled her week . he gave him Rachel his daughter as wife .
Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah , his handmaid , to be her handmaid .
he went in also to Rachel , and he loved also Rachel more than Leah , and served with him yet seven other years .
Yahweh saw that Leah was hated , and he opened her womb , but Rachel was barren .
Leah conceived , and bore a son , and she named him Reuben . for she said , " Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction . for now my husband will love me . "
she conceived again , and bore a son , and said , " Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated , he has therefore given me this son also . " she named him Simeon .
she conceived again , and bore a son . said , " Now this time will my husband be joined to me , because I have borne him three sons . " therefore his name was called Levi .
she conceived again , and bore a son . she said , " This time will I praise Yahweh . " therefore she named him Judah . then she stopped bearing .
when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children , Rachel envied her sister . she said to Jacob , " Give me children , or else I will die . "
Jacob 's anger was kindled against Rachel , and he said , " Am I in God 's place , who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb ? "
she said , " behold , my maid Bilhah . go in to her , that she may bear on my knees , and I also may obtain children by her . "
she gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife , and Jacob went in to her .
Bilhah conceived , and bore Jacob a son .
Rachel said , " God has judged me , and has also heard my voice , and has given me a son . " therefore called she his name Dan .
Bilhah , Rachel 's handmaid , conceived again , and bore Jacob a second son .
Rachel said , " With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister , and have prevailed . " she named him Naphtali .
when Leah saw that she had finished bearing , she took Zilpah , her handmaid , and gave her to Jacob as a wife .
Zilpah , Leah 's handmaid , bore Jacob a son .
Leah said , " How fortunate ! " she named him Gad .
Zilpah , Leah 's handmaid , bore Jacob a second son .
Leah said , " Happy am I , for the daughters will call me happy . " she named him Asher .
God listened to Leah , and she conceived , and bore Jacob a fifth son .
Leah said , " God has given me my hire , because I gave my handmaid to my husband . " she named him Issachar .
Leah conceived again , and bore a sixth son to Jacob .
Leah said , " God has endowed me with a good dowry . now my husband will live with me , because I have borne him six sons . " she named him Zebulun .
afterwards , she bore a daughter , and named her Dinah .
God remembered Rachel , and God listened to her , and opened her womb .
she conceived , bore a son , and said , " God has taken away my reproach . "
it happened , when Rachel had borne Joseph , that Jacob said to Laban , " Send me away , that I may go to my own place , and to my country .
give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you , and let me go ; for you know my service with which I have served you . "
Laban said to him , " If now I have found favor in your eyes , stay here , for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake . "
he said , " appoint me your wages , and I will give it . "
he said to him , " You know how I have served you , and how your livestock have fared with me .
for it was little which you had before I came , and it has increased to a multitude . Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned . now when will I provide for my own house also ? "
I will pass through all your flock today , removing from there every speckled and spotted one , and every black one among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goats . this will be my hire .
Laban said , " behold , let it be according to your word . "
that day , he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted , and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted , every one that had white in it , and all the black ones among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
he set three days ' journey between himself and Jacob , and Jacob fed the rest of Laban 's flocks .
Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar , almond , plane tree , peeled white streaks in them , and made the white appear which was in the rods .
he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering @-@ troughs where the flocks came to drink . they conceived when they came to drink .
the flocks conceived before the rods , and the flocks produced streaked , speckled , and spotted .
Jacob separated the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban : and he put his own droves apart , and didn 't put them into Laban 's flock .
it happened , whenever the stronger of the flock conceived , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods ;
but when the flock were feeble , he didn 't put them in . so the feebler were Laban 's , and the stronger Jacob 's .
the man increased exceedingly , and had large flocks , female servants and male servants , and camels and donkeys .
Jacob saw the expression on Laban 's face , and , behold , it was not toward him as before .
Yahweh said to Jacob , " Return to the land of your fathers , and to your relatives , and I will be with you . "
Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock ,
and said to them , " I see the expression on your father 's face , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father has been with me .
you know that I have served your father with all of my strength .
your father has deceived me , and changed my wages ten times , but God didn 't allow him to hurt me .
if he said this , ' The speckled will be your wages , ' then all the flock bore speckled . if he said this , ' The streaked will be your wages , ' then all the flock bore streaked .
thus God has taken away your father 's livestock , and given them to me .
it happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and behold , the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked , speckled , and grizzled .
the angel of God said to me in the dream , ' Jacob , ' and I said , ' Here I am . '
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and behold , all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked , speckled , and grizzled , for I have seen all that Laban does to you .
I am the God of Bethel , where you anointed a pillar , where you vowed a vow to me . now arise , get out from this land , and return to the land of your birth . ' "
Rachel and Leah answered him , " Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father 's house ?
Aren 't we accounted by him as foreigners ? for he has sold us , and has also quite devoured our money .
for all the riches which God has taken away from our father , that is ours and our children 's . now then , whatever God has said to you , do . "
then Jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives on the camels ,
and he took away all his livestock , and all his possessions which he had gathered , including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram , to go to Isaac his father , to the land of Canaan .
now Laban had gone to shear his sheep : and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father 's .
Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian , in that he didn 't tell him that he was running away .
so he fled with all that he had . he rose up , passed over the River , and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead .
he took his relatives with him , and pursued after him seven days ' journey . he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead .
God came to Laban , the Syrian , in a dream of the night , and said to him , " Take heed to yourself that you don 't speak to Jacob either good or bad . "
Laban caught up with Jacob . now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain , and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead .
Laban said to Jacob , " What have you done , that you have deceived me , and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword ?
why did you flee secretly , and deceive me , and didn 't tell me , that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs , with tambourine and with harp ;
and didn 't allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? now have you done foolishly .
it is in the power of my hand to hurt you , but the God of your father spoke to me last night , saying , ' Take heed to yourself that you don 't speak to Jacob either good or bad . '
now , you want to be gone , because you greatly longed for your father 's house , but why have you stolen my gods ? "
Jacob answered Laban , " Because I was afraid , for I said , ' Lest you should take your daughters from me by force . '
Laban went into Jacob 's tent , into Leah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he didn 't find them . he went out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
now Rachel had taken the teraphim , put them in the Camel 's saddle , and sat on them . Laban felt about all the tent , but didn 't find them .
she said to her father , " Don 't let my lord be angry that I can 't rise up before you ; for I 'm having my period . " he searched , but didn 't find the teraphim .
Jacob was angry , and argued with Laban . Jacob answered Laban , " What is my trespass ? what is my sin , that you have hotly pursued after me ?
now that you have felt around in all my stuff , what have you found of all your household stuff ? set it here before my relatives and your relatives , that they may judge between us two .
" these twenty years I have been with you . your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young , and I haven 't eaten the rams of your flocks .
that which was torn of animals , I didn 't bring to you . I bore its loss . of my hand you required it , whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
this was my situation : in the day the drought consumed me , and the Frost by night ; and my sleep fled from my eyes .
these twenty years I have been in your house . I served you fourteen years for your two daughters , and six years for your flock , and you have changed my wages ten times .
now come , let us make a Covenant , you and I ; and let it be for a witness between me and you . "
Jacob took a stone , and set it up for a pillar .
Jacob said to his relatives , " Gather stones . " they took stones , and made a heap . they ate there by the heap .
Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha , but Jacob called it Galeed .
Laban said , " This heap is witness between me and you this day . " therefore it was named Galeed
and Mizpah , for he said , " Yahweh watch between me and you , when we are absent one from another .
if you afflict my daughters , or if you take wives besides my daughters , no man is with us ; behold , God is witness between me and you . "
Laban said to Jacob , " See this heap , and see the pillar , which I have set between me and you .
May this heap be a witness , and the pillar be a witness , that I will not pass over this heap to you , and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me , for harm .
the God of Abraham , and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge between us . " then Jacob swore by the fear of his father , Isaac .
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain , and called his relatives to eat bread . they ate bread , and stayed all night in the mountain .
early in the morning , Laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them . Laban departed and returned to his place .
Jacob went on his way , and the angels of God met him .
when he saw them , Jacob said , " This is God 's army . " he called the name of that place Mahanaim .
Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau , his brother , to the land of Seir , the field of Edom .
he commanded them , saying , " This is what you shall tell my lord , Esau : ' this is what your servant , Jacob , says . I have lived as a foreigner with Laban , and stayed until now .
I have cattle , donkeys , flocks , male servants , and female servants . I have sent to tell my lord , that I may find favor in your sight . ' "
the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , " We came to your brother Esau . not only that , but he comes to meet you , and four hundred men with him . "
then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed . he divided the people who were with him , and the flocks , and the herds , and the camels , into two companies ;
and he said , " If Esau comes to the one company , and strikes it , then the company which is left will escape . "
I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses , and of all the truth , which you have shown to your servant ; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I have become two companies .
please deliver me from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he come and strike me , and the mothers with the children .
you said , ' I will surely do you good , and make your seed as the sand of the sea , which can 't be numbered because there are so many . ' "
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every herd by itself , and said to his servants , " Pass over before me , and put a space between herd and herd . "
he commanded the foremost , saying , " When Esau , my brother , meets you , and asks you , saying , ' whose are you ? where are you going ? whose are these before you ? '
then you shall say , ' They are your servant , Jacob 's . it is a present sent to my lord , Esau . behold , he also is behind us . ' "
he commanded also the second , and the third , and all that followed the herds , saying , " This is how you shall speak to Esau , when you find him .
so the present passed over before him , and he himself lodged that night in the camp .
he rose up that night , and took his two wives , and his two handmaids , and his eleven sons , and passed over the Ford of the Jabbok .
he took them , and sent them over the stream , and sent over that which he had .
Jacob was left alone , and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day .
when he saw that he didn 't prevail against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh , and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was strained , as he wrestled .
the man said , " Let me go , for the day breaks . " Jacob said , " I won 't let you go , unless you bless me . "
he said , " Your name will no longer be called Jacob , but Israel ; for you have fought with God and with men , and have prevailed . "
Jacob asked him , " Please tell me your name . " he said , " Why is it that you ask what my name is ? " he blessed him there .
Jacob called the name of the place Peniel : for , he said , " I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved . "
the sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel , and he limped because of his thigh .
therefore the children of Israel don 't eat the sinew of the hip , which is on the hollow of the thigh , to this day , because he touched the hollow of Jacob 's thigh in the sinew of the hip .
Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Esau was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Leah , Rachel , and the two handmaids .
he put the handmaids and their children in front , Leah and her children after , and Rachel and Joseph at the rear .
he himself passed over in front of them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
Esau ran to meet him , embraced him , fell on his neck , kissed him , and they wept .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , " Who are these with you ? " he said , " The children whom God has graciously given your servant . "
then the handmaids came near with their children , and they bowed themselves .
Leah also and her children came near , and bowed themselves . after them , Joseph came near with Rachel , and they bowed themselves .
Esau said , " What do you mean by all this company which I met ? " Jacob said , " To find favor in the sight of my lord . "
Esau said , " I have enough , my brother ; let that which you have be yours . "
please take the gift that I brought to you , because God has dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough . " he urged him , and he took it .
Esau said , " Let us take our journey , and let us go , and I will go before you . "
Jacob said to him , " My lord knows that the children are tender , and that the flocks and herds with me have their young , and if they overdrive them one day , all the flocks will die .
please let my lord pass over before his servant , and I will lead on gently , according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lord to Seir . "
so Esau returned that day on his way to Seir .
Jacob traveled to Succoth , built himself a house , and made shelters for his livestock . therefore the name of the place is called Succoth .
Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Paddan Aram ; and encamped before the city .
he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
he erected an altar there , and called it El Elohe Israel .
Dinah , the daughter of Leah , whom she bore to Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , the prince of the land , saw her . he took her , lay with her , and humbled her .
Shechem spoke to his father , Hamor , saying , " Get me this young lady as a wife . "
now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah , his daughter ; and his sons were with his livestock in the field . Jacob held his peace until they came .
Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him .
Hamor talked with them , saying , " The soul of my son , Shechem , longs for your daughter . please give her to him as a wife .
make marriages with us . give your daughters to us , and take our daughters for yourselves .
you shall dwell with us , and the land will be before you . live and trade in it , and get possessions in it . "
Shechem said to her father and to her brothers , " Let me find favor in your eyes , and whatever you will tell me I will give .
ask me a great amount for a dowry , and I will give whatever you ask of me , but give me the young lady as a wife . "
the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit , and spoke , because he had defiled Dinah their sister ,
and said to them , " We can 't do this thing , to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised ; for that is a reproach to us .
only on this condition will we consent to you . if you will be as we are , that every male of you be circumcised ;
then will we give our daughters to you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if you will not listen to us , to be circumcised , then we will take our sister , and we will be gone . "
their words pleased Hamor and Shechem , Hamor 's son .
the young man didn 't wait to do this thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter , and he was honored above all the house of his father .
Hamor and Shechem , his son , came to the gate of their city , and talked with the men of their city , saying ,
only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us , to become one people , if every male among us is circumcised , as they are circumcised .
won 't their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours ? only let us give our consent to them , and they will dwell with us . "
all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor , and to Shechem his son ; and every male was circumcised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
they killed Hamor and Shechem , his son , with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went away .
Jacob 's sons came on the dead , and plundered the city , because they had defiled their sister .
they took their flocks , their herds , their donkeys , that which was in the city , that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth . they took captive all their little ones and their wives , and took as plunder everything that was in the house .
they said , " Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute ? "
God said to Jacob , " arise , go up to Bethel , and live there . make there an altar to God , who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother . "
then Jacob said to his household , and to all who were with him , " Put away the foreign gods that are among you , purify yourselves , change your garments .
let us arise , and go up to Bethel . I will make there an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands , and the rings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem .
they traveled , and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them , and they didn 't pursue the sons of Jacob .
so Jacob came to Luz ( that is , Bethel ) , which is in the land of Canaan , he and all the people who were with him .
he built an altar there , and called the place El Beth El ; because there God was revealed to him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
Deborah , Rebekah 's nurse , died , and she was buried below Bethel under the oak ; and its name was called Allon Bacuth .
God appeared to Jacob again , when he came from Paddan Aram , and blessed him .
God said to him , " Your name is Jacob . your name shall not be Jacob any more , but your name will be Israel . " he named him Israel .
God said to him , " I am God Almighty . be fruitful and multiply . a nation and a company of nations will be from you , and kings will come out of your body .
the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac , I will give it to you , and to your seed after you will I give the land . "
God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him .
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him , a pillar of stone . he poured out a drink offering on it , and poured oil on it .
Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him " Bethel . "
they traveled from Bethel . there was still some distance to come to Ephrath , and Rachel travailed . she had hard labor .
when she was in hard labor , the midwife said to her , " Don 't be afraid , for now you will have another son . "
it happened , as her soul was departing ( for she died ) , that she named him Benoni , but his father named him Benjamin .
Jacob set up a pillar on her grave . the same is the Pillar of Rachel 's grave to this day .
Israel traveled , and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder .
it happened , while Israel lived in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah , his father 's concubine , and Israel heard of it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve .
the sons of Leah : Reuben ( Jacob 's firstborn ) , Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , and Zebulun .
the sons of Rachel : Joseph and Benjamin .
the sons of Bilhah ( Rachel 's handmaid ) : Dan and Naphtali .
the sons of Zilpah ( Leah 's handmaid ) : Gad and Asher . these are the sons of Jacob , who were born to him in Paddan Aram .
Jacob came to Isaac his father , to Mamre , to Kiriath Arba ( which is Hebron ) , where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners .
the days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years .
Isaac gave up the spirit , and died , and was gathered to his people , old and full of days . Esau and Jacob , his sons , buried him .
now this is the history of the generations of Esau ( that is , Edom ) .
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan : Adah the daughter of Elon , the Hittite ; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , the Hivite ;
and Basemath , Ishmael 's daughter , sister of Nebaioth .
Oholibamah bore Jeush , Jalam , and Korah . these are the sons of Esau , who were born to him in the land of Canaan .
Esau took his wives , his sons , his daughters , and all the members of his household , with his livestock , all his animals , and all his possessions , which he had gathered in the land of Canaan , and went into a land away from his brother Jacob .
for their substance was too great for them to dwell together , and the land of their travels couldn 't bear them because of their livestock .
Esau lived in the hill country of Seir . Esau is Edom .
this is the history of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir :
these are the names of Esau 's sons : Eliphaz , the son of Adah , the wife of Esau ; and Reuel , the son of Basemath , the wife of Esau .
the sons of Eliphaz were Teman , Omar , Zepho , and Gatam , and Kenaz .
these were the sons of Oholibamah , the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , Esau 's wife : she bore to Esau Jeush , Jalam , and Korah .
these are the chiefs of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau : chief Teman , chief Omar , chief Zepho , chief Kenaz ,
chief Korah , chief Gatam , chief Amalek : these are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Adah .

these are the sons of Oholibamah , Esau 's wife : chief Jeush , chief Jalam , chief Korah : these are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
these are the sons of Esau ( that is , Edom ) , and these are their chiefs .
these are the sons of Seir the Horite , the inhabitants of the land : Lotan , Shobal , Zibeon , Anah ,
Dishon , Ezer , and Dishan . these are the chiefs who came of the Horites , the children of Seir in the land of Edom .
the children of Lotan were Hori and Heman . Lotan 's sister was Timna .
these are the children of Shobal : Alvan , Manahath , Ebal , Shepho , and Onam .
these are the children of Zibeon : Aiah and Anah . this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness , as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father .
these are the children of Anah : Dishon and Oholibamah , the daughter of Anah .
these are the children of Dishon : Hemdan , Eshban , Ithran , and Cheran .
these are the children of Ezer : Bilhan , Zaavan , and Akan .
these are the children of Dishan : Uz and Aran .
these are the chiefs who came of the Horites : chief Lotan , chief Shobal , chief Zibeon , chief Anah ,
chief Dishon , chief Ezer , and chief Dishan : these are the chiefs who came of the Horites , according to their chiefs in the land of Seir .
these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom , before any king reigned over the children of Israel .
Bela , the son of Beor , reigned in Edom . the name of his city was Dinhabah .
Bela died , and Jobab , the son of Zerah of Bozrah , reigned in his place .
Jobab died , and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place .
Husham died , and Hadad , the son of Bedad , who struck Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his place . the name of his city was Avith .
Hadad died , and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place .
Samlah died , and Shaul of Rehoboth by the river , reigned in his place .
Shaul died , and Baal Hanan , the son of Achbor reigned in his place .
Baal Hanan the son of Achbor died , and Hadar reigned in his place . the name of his city was Pau . his wife 's name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Timna , chief Alvah , chief Jetheth ,
chief Magdiel , and chief Iram . these are the chiefs of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession . this is Esau , the father of the Edomites .
Jacob lived in the land of his father 's travels , in the land of Canaan .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age , and he made him a coat of many colors .
his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers , and they hated him , and couldn 't speak peaceably to him .
Joseph dreamed a dream , and he told it to his brothers , and they hated him all the more .
he said to them , " Please hear this dream which I have dreamed :
for behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and behold , my sheaf arose and also stood upright ; and behold , your sheaves came around , and bowed down to my sheaf . "
his brothers said to him , " Will you indeed reign over us ? or will you indeed have dominion over us ? " they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words .
he dreamed yet another dream , and told it to his brothers , and said , " behold , I have dreamed yet another dream : and behold , the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me . "
his brothers envied him , but his father kept this saying in mind .
his brothers went to feed their father 's flock in Shechem .
Israel said to Joseph , " Aren 't your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem ? come , and I will send you to them . " he said to him , " Here I am . "
a certain man found him , and behold , he was wandering in the field . the man asked him , " What are you looking for ? "
he said , " I am looking for my brothers . tell me , please , where they are feeding the flock . "
the man said , " They have left here , for I heard them say , ' Let us go to Dothan . ' " Joseph went after his brothers , and found them in Dothan .
they saw him afar off , and before he came near to them , they conspired against him to kill him .
they said one to another , " behold , this dreamer comes .
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the pits , and we will say , ' An evil animal has devoured him . ' we will see what will become of his dreams . "
Reuben heard it , and delivered him out of their hand , and said , " Let 's not take his life . "
Reuben said to them , " shed no blood . throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness , but lay no hand on him " --that he might deliver him out of their hand , to restore him to his father .
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stripped Joseph of his coat , the coat of many colors that was on him ;
and they took him , and threw him into the pit . the pit was empty . there was no water in it .
they sat down to eat bread , and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead , with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt .
Judah said to his brothers , " What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood ?
come , and let 's sell him to the Ishmaelites , and not let our hand be on him ; for he is our brother , our flesh . " his brothers listened to him .
Midianites who were merchants passed by , and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver . they brought Joseph into Egypt .
Reuben returned to the pit ; and saw that Joseph wasn 't in the pit ; and he tore his clothes .
he returned to his brothers , and said , " The child is no more ; and I , where will I go ? "
they took Joseph 's coat , and killed a male goat , and dipped the coat in the blood .
they took the coat of many colors , and they brought it to their father , and said , " We have found this . examine it , now , whether it is your son 's coat or not . "
he recognized it , and said , " It is my son 's coat . an evil animal has devoured him . Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces . "
Jacob tore his clothes , and put sackcloth on his waist , and mourned for his son many days .
all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him , but he refused to be comforted . he said , " For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning . " his father wept for him .
the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , the captain of the guard .
it happened at that time , that Judah went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua . he took her , and went in to her .
she conceived , and bore a son ; and he named him ER .
she conceived again , and bore a son ; and she named him Onan .
she yet again bore a son , and named him Shelah : and he was at Chezib , when she bore him .
Judah took a wife for ER , his firstborn , and her name was Tamar .
ER , Judah 's firstborn , was wicked in the sight of Yahweh . Yahweh killed him .
Judah said to Onan , " Go in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up seed to your brother . "
Onan knew that the seed wouldn 't be his ; and it happened , when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest he should give seed to his brother .
the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and he killed him also .
after many days , Shua 's daughter , the wife of Judah , died . Judah was comforted , and went up to his sheepshearers to Timnah , he and his friend Hirah , the Adullamite .
it was told Tamar , saying , " behold , your father @-@ in @-@ law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep . "
when Judah saw her , he thought that she was a prostitute , for she had covered her face .
he said , " I will send you a young goat from the flock . " she said , " Will you give me a pledge , until you send it ? "
she arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend , the Adullamite , to receive the pledge from the woman 's hand , but he didn 't find her .
he returned to Judah , and said , " I haven 't found her ; and also the men of the place said , ' There has been no prostitute here . ' "
Judah said , " Let her keep it , lest we be shamed . behold , I sent this young goat , and you haven 't found her . "
it happened about three months later , that it was told Judah , saying , " Tamar , your daughter @-@ in @-@ law , has played the prostitute ; and moreover , behold , she is with child by prostitution . " Judah said , " Bring her out , and let her be burnt . "
Judah acknowledged them , and said , " She is more righteous than I , because I didn 't give her to Shelah , my son . " he knew her again no more .
it happened in the time of her travail , that behold , twins were in her womb .
when she travailed , one put out a hand , and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand , saying , " This came out first . "
afterward his brother came out , that had the scarlet thread on his hand , and his name was called Zerah .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there .
Yahweh was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man . he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
his master saw that Yahweh was with him , and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand .
Joseph found favor in his sight . he ministered to him , and he made him overseer over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand . he didn 't concern himself with anything , except for the food which he ate . Joseph was well @-@ built and handsome .
it happened after these things , that his master 's wife cast her eyes on Joseph ; and she said , " Lie with me . "
as she spoke to Joseph day by day , he didn 't listen to her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
about this time , he went into the house to do his work , and there were none of the men of the house inside .
she caught him by his garment , saying , " Lie with me ! " he left his garment in her hand , and ran outside .
when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and had run outside ,
it happened , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
she laid up his garment by her , until his master came home .
she spoke to him according to these words , saying , " The Hebrew servant , whom you have brought to us , came in to me to mock me ,
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your servant did to me , " that his wrath was kindled .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
but Yahweh was with Joseph , and showed kindness to him , and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison . whatever they did there , he was responsible for it .
the keeper of the prison didn 't look after anything that was under his hand , because Yahweh was with him ; and that which he did , Yahweh made it prosper .
it happened after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Baker offended their lord , the king of Egypt .
Pharaoh was angry with his two officers , the chief cupbearer and the chief Baker .
he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph , and he took care of them . they stayed in prison many days .
they both dreamed a dream , each man his dream , in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the cupbearer and the Baker of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
Joseph came in to them in the morning , and saw them , and saw that they were sad .
he asked Pharaoh 's officers who were with him in custody in his master 's house , saying , " Why do you look so sad today ? "
they said to him , " We have dreamed a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it . " Joseph said to them , " Don 't interpretations belong to God ? please tell it to me . "
the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , " In my dream , behold , a vine was in front of me ,
and in the vine were three branches . it was as though it budded , it blossomed , and its clusters produced ripe grapes .
Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand ; and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand . "
Joseph said to him , " This is its interpretation : the three branches are three days .
within three more days , Pharaoh will lift up your head , and restore you to your office . you will give Pharaoh 's cup into his hand , the way you did when you were his cupbearer .
but remember me when it will be well with you , and please show kindness to me , and make mention of me to Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house .
for indeed , I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews , and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon . "
when the chief Baker saw that the interpretation was good , he said to Joseph , " I also was in my dream , and behold , three baskets of white bread were on my head .
in the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh , and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head . "
Joseph answered , " This is its interpretation . the three baskets are three days .
within three more days , Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you , and will hang you on a tree ; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you . "
it happened the third day , which was Pharaoh 's birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants , and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief Baker among his servants .
he restored the chief cupbearer to his position again , and he gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand ;
yet the chief cupbearer didn 't remember Joseph , but forgot him .
it happened at the end of two full years , that Pharaoh dreamed : and behold , he stood by the river .
behold , there came up out of the river seven cattle , sleek and fat , and they fed in the marsh grass .
behold , seven other cattle came up after them out of the river , ugly and thin , and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river .
the ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle . so Pharaoh awoke .
he slept and dreamed a second time : and behold , seven heads of grain came up on one stalk , healthy and good .
behold , seven heads of grain , thin and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears . Pharaoh awoke , and behold , it was a dream .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's magicians and wise men . Pharaoh told them his dreams , but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh .
then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh , saying , " I remember my faults today .
Pharaoh was angry with his servants , and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , me and the chief Baker .
we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he . we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
there was with us there a young man , a Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams . to each man according to his dream he interpreted .
it happened , as he interpreted to us , so it was : he restored me to my office , and he hanged him . "
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon . he shaved himself , changed his clothing , and came in to Pharaoh .
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " I have dreamed a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it . I have heard it said of you , that when you hear a dream you can interpret it . "
Joseph answered Pharaoh , saying , " It isn 't in me . God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace . "
Pharaoh spoke to Joseph , " In my dream , behold , I stood on the brink of the river :
and behold , there came up out of the river seven cattle , fat and sleek . they fed in the marsh grass ,
and behold , seven other cattle came up after them , poor and very ugly and thin , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness .
the thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle ,
and when they had eaten them up , it couldn 't be known that they had eaten them , but they were still ugly , as at the beginning . so I awoke .
I saw in my dream , and behold , seven heads of grain came up on one stalk , full and good :
and behold , seven heads of grain , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain . I told it to the magicians , but there was no one who could explain it to me . "
Joseph said to Pharaoh , " The dream of Pharaoh is one . what God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh .
the seven good cattle are seven years ; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years . the dream is one .
the seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years , and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind ; they will be seven years of famine .
that is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh . what God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh .
behold , there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt .
there will arise after them seven years of famine , and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt . the famine will consume the land ,
and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows ; for it will be very grievous .
the dream was doubled to Pharaoh , because the thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass .
" now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man , and set him over the land of Egypt .
let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint overseers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt 's produce in the seven plenteous years .
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not perish through the famine . "
the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
Pharaoh said to his servants , " Can we find such a one as this , a man in whom is the Spirit of God ? "
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " Because God has shown you all of this , there is none so discreet and wise as you .
you shall be over my house , and according to your word will all my people be ruled . only in the throne I will be greater than you . "
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " behold , I have set you over all the land of Egypt . "
Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in robes of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ,
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had . they cried before him , " bow the knee ! " he set him over all the land of Egypt .
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " I am Pharaoh , and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt . "
Pharaoh called Joseph 's name Zaphenath @-@ Paneah ; and he gave him Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife . Joseph went out over the land of Egypt .
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
in the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly .
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was around every city , he laid up in the same .
Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea , very much , until he stopped counting , for it was without number .
to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera priest of On , bore to him .
Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh , " For , " he said , " God has made me forget all my toil , and all my father 's house . "
the name of the second , he called Ephraim : " for God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction . "
the seven years of plenty , that were in the land of Egypt , came to an end .
the seven years of famine began to come , just as Joseph had said . there was famine in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
when all the land of Egypt was famished , the people cried to Pharaoh for bread , and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians , " Go to Joseph . what he says to you , do . "
the famine was over all the surface of the earth . Joseph opened all the store houses , and sold to the Egyptians . the famine was severe in the land of Egypt .
all countries came into Egypt , to Joseph , to buy grain , because the famine was severe in all the earth .
now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt , and Jacob said to his sons , " Why do you look at one another ? "
he said , " behold , I have heard that there is grain in Egypt . go down there , and buy for us from there , so that we may live , and not die . "
Joseph 's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt .
but Jacob didn 't send Benjamin , Joseph 's brother , with his brothers ; for he said , " Lest perhaps harm happen to him . "
the sons of Israel came to buy among those who came , for the famine was in the land of Canaan .
Joseph was the governor over the land . it was he who sold to all the people of the land . Joseph 's brothers came , and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth .
Joseph saw his brothers , and he recognized them , but acted like a stranger to them , and spoke roughly with them . he said to them , " Where did you come from ? " they said , " From the land of Canaan to buy food . "
Joseph recognized his brothers , but they didn 't recognize him .
Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them , and said to them , " You are spies ! you have come to see the nakedness of the land . "
they said to him , " No , my lord , but your servants have come to buy food .
we are all one man 's sons ; we are honest men . your servants are not spies . "
he said to them , " No , but you have come to see the nakedness of the land ! "
by this you shall be tested . by the life of Pharaoh , you shall not go out from here , unless your youngest brother comes here .
he put them all together into custody for three days .
Joseph said to them the third day , " Do this , and live , for I fear God .
if you are honest men , then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison ; but you go , carry grain for the famine of your houses .
bring your youngest brother to me ; so will your words be verified , and you won 't die . " they did so .
Reuben answered them , saying , " Didn 't I tell you , saying , ' Don 't sin against the child , ' and you wouldn 't listen ? therefore also , behold , his blood is required . "
they didn 't know that Joseph understood them ; for there was an interpreter between them .
he turned himself away from them , and wept . then he returned to them , and spoke to them , and took Simeon from among them , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain , and to restore each man 's money into his sack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
they loaded their donkeys with their grain , and departed from there .
as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place , he saw his money . behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .
they came to Jacob their father , to the land of Canaan , and told him all that had happened to them , saying ,
" the man , the lord of the land , spoke roughly with us , and took us for spies of the country .
we said to him , ' We are honest men . we are no spies .
we are twelve brothers , sons of our father ; one is no more , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan . '
the man , the lord of the land , said to us , ' By this I will know that you are honest men : leave one of your brothers with me , and take grain for the famine of your houses , and go your way .
bring your youngest brother to me . then I will know that you are not spies , but that you are honest men . so I will deliver your brother to you , and you shall trade in the land . ' "
it happened as they emptied their sacks , that behold , each man 's bundle of money was in his sack . when they and their father saw their bundles of money , they were afraid .
Jacob , their father , said to them , " You have bereaved me of my children ! Joseph is no more , Simeon is no more , and you want to take Benjamin away . all these things are against me . "
Reuben spoke to his father , saying , " Kill my two sons , if I don 't bring him to you . entrust him to my care , and I will bring him to you again . "
the famine was severe in the land .
it happened , when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said to them , " Go again , buy us a little more food . "
Judah spoke to him , saying , " The man solemnly warned us , saying , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . '
if you 'll send our brother with us , we 'll go down and buy you food ,
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
Israel said , " Why did you treat me so badly , telling the man that you had another brother ? "
Judah said to Israel , his father , " Send the boy with me , and we 'll get up and go , so that we may live , and not die , both we , and you , and also our little ones .
I 'll be collateral for him . from my hand will you require him . if I don 't bring him to you , and set him before you , then let me bear the blame forever ,
for if we hadn 't delayed , surely we would have returned a second time by now . "
and take double money in your hand , and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks . perhaps it was an oversight .
take your brother also , get up , and return to the man .
May God Almighty give you mercy before the man , that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin . if I am bereaved of my children , I am bereaved . "
the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and got up , went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
when Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the steward of his house , " Bring the men into the house , and butcher an animal , and prepare ; for the men will dine with me at noon . "
the man did as Joseph commanded , and the man brought the men to Joseph 's house .
they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they spoke to him at the door of the house ,
and said , " Oh , my lord , we indeed came down the first time to buy food .
when we came to the lodging place , we opened our sacks , and behold , each man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight . we have brought it back in our hand .
we have brought down other money in our hand to buy food . we don 't know who put our money in our sacks . "
the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet . he gave their donkeys fodder .
they prepared the present for Joseph 's coming at noon , for they heard that they should eat bread there .
when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed themselves down to him to the earth .
he asked them of their welfare , and said , " Is your father well , the old man of whom you spoke ? is he yet alive ? "
they said , " Your servant , our father , is well . he is still alive . " they bowed down humbly .
Joseph hurried , for his heart yearned over his brother ; and he sought a place to weep . he entered into his room , and wept there .
he washed his face , and came out . he controlled himself , and said , " serve the meal . "
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyptians , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyptians don 't eat bread with the Hebrews , for that is an abomination to the Egyptians .
they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth , and the men marveled one with another .
he sent portions to them from before him , but Benjamin 's portion was five times as much as any of theirs . they drank , and were merry with him .
he commanded the steward of his house , saying , " fill the men 's sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put each man 's money in his sack 's mouth .
put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack 's mouth of the youngest , with his grain money . " he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their donkeys .
Isn 't this that from which my lord drinks , and by which he indeed divines ? you have done evil in so doing . ' "
he overtook them , and he spoke these words to them .
they said to him , " Why does my lord speak such words as these ? far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing !
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan . how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord 's house ?
with whomever of your servants it is found , let him die , and we also will be my lord 's bondservants . "
he said , " Now also let it be according to your words : he with whom it is found will be my bondservant ; and you will be blameless . "
he searched , beginning with the eldest , and ending at the youngest . the cup was found in Benjamin 's sack .
then they tore their clothes , and each man loaded his donkey , and returned to the city .
Judah and his brothers came to Joseph 's house , and he was still there . they fell on the ground before him .
Joseph said to them , " What deed is this that you have done ? Don 't you know that such a man as I can indeed divine ? "
he said , " Far be it from me that I should do so . the man in whose hand the cup is found , he will be my bondservant ; but as for you , go up in peace to your father . "
then Judah came near to him , and said , " Oh , my lord , please let your servant speak a word in my lord 's ears , and don 't let your anger burn against your servant ; for you are even as Pharaoh .
my lord asked his servants , saying , ' Have you a father , or a brother ? '
you said to your servants , ' Bring him down to me , that I may set my eyes on him . '
we said to my lord , ' The boy can 't leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die . '
you said to your servants , ' Unless your youngest brother comes down with you , you will see my face no more . '
it happened when we came up to your servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
our father said , ' Go again , buy us a little food . '
we said , ' We can 't go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
your servant , my father , said to us , ' You know that my wife bore me two sons :
and the one went out from me , and I said , " surely he is torn in pieces " ; and I haven 't seen him since .
if you take this one also from me , and harm happens to him , you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol . '
for your servant became collateral for the boy to my father , saying , ' If I don 't bring him to you , then I will bear the blame to my father forever . '
now therefore , please let your servant stay instead of the boy , a bondservant to my lord ; and let the boy go up with his brothers .
for how will I go up to my father , if the boy isn 't with me ? --lest I see the evil that will come on my father . "
then Joseph couldn 't control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cried , " Cause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
he wept aloud . the Egyptians heard , and the house of Pharaoh heard .
Joseph said to his brothers , " I am Joseph ! does my father still live ? " his brothers couldn 't answer him ; for they were terrified at his presence .
Joseph said to his brothers , " Come near to me , please . " they came near . " he said , I am Joseph , your brother , whom you sold into Egypt .
now don 't be grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that you sold me here , for God sent me before you to preserve life .
for these two years the famine has been in the land , and there are yet five years , in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest .
God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth , and to save you alive by a great deliverance .
so now it wasn 't you who sent me here , but God , and he has made me a father to Pharaoh , lord of all his house , and ruler over all the land of Egypt .
hurry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lord of all Egypt . come down to me . Don 't wait .
you shall dwell in the land of Goshen , and you will be near to me , you , your children , your children 's children , your flocks , your herds , and all that you have .
there I will nourish you ; for there are yet five years of famine ; lest you come to poverty , you , and your household , and all that you have . " '
behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin , that it is my mouth that speaks to you .
you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that you have seen . you shall hurry and bring my father down here . "
he fell on his brother Benjamin 's neck , and wept , and Benjamin wept on his neck .
he kissed all his brothers , and wept on them . after that his brothers talked with him .
the report of it was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , " Joseph 's brothers have come . " it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " Tell your brothers , ' Do this . load your animals , and go , travel to the land of Canaan .
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the fat of the land . '
now you are commanded : do this . take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
also , don 't concern yourselves about your belongings , for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours . "
the sons of Israel did so . Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
he gave each one of them changes of clothing , but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing .
he sent the following to his father : ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way .
so he sent his brothers away , and they departed . he said to them , " See that you don 't quarrel on the way . "
they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan , to Jacob their father .
they told him , saying , " Joseph is still alive , and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt . " his heart fainted , for he didn 't believe them .
they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said to them . when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob , their father , revived .
Israel said , " It is enough . Joseph my son is still alive . I will go and see him before I die . "
Israel traveled with all that he had , and came to Beersheba , and offered sacrifices to the God of his father , Isaac .
God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night , and said , " Jacob , Jacob ! " he said , " Here I am . "
he said , " I am God , the God of your father . Don 't be afraid to go down into Egypt , for there I will make of you a great nation .
I will go down with you into Egypt . I will also surely bring you up again . Joseph will close your eyes . "
Jacob rose up from Beersheba , and the sons of Israel carried Jacob , their father , their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
they took their livestock , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt--Jacob , and all his seed with him ,
these are the names of the children of Israel , who came into Egypt , Jacob and his sons : Reuben , Jacob 's firstborn .
the sons of Reuben : Hanoch , Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi .
the sons of Simeon : Jemuel , Jamin , Ohad , Jachin , Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman .
the sons of Levi : Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
the sons of Judah : ER , Onan , Shelah , Perez , and Zerah ; but ER and Onan died in the land of Canaan . the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul .
the sons of Zebulun : Sered , Elon , and Jahleel .
these are the sons of Leah , whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram , with his daughter Dinah . all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty @-@ three .
the sons of Gad : Ziphion , Haggi , Shuni , Ezbon , Eri , Arodi , and Areli .
the sons of Asher : Imnah , Ishvah , Ishvi , Beriah , and Serah their sister . the sons of Beriah : Heber and Malchiel .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob , even sixteen souls .
the sons of Rachel , Jacob 's wife : Joseph and Benjamin .
to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of On , bore to him .
the sons of Benjamin : Bela , Becher , Ashbel , Gera , Naaman , Ehi , Rosh , Muppim , Huppim , and Ard .
these are the sons of Rachel , who were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
the son of Dan : Hushim .
the sons of Naphtali : Jahzeel , Guni , Jezer , and Shillem .
these are the sons of Bilhah , whom Laban gave to Rachel , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob : all the souls were seven .
all the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt , who were his direct descendants , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives , all the souls were sixty @-@ six .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two souls . all the souls of the house of Jacob , who came into Egypt , were seventy .
he sent Judah before him to Joseph , to show the way before him to Goshen , and they came into the land of Goshen .
Joseph prepared his chariot , and went up to meet Israel , his father , in Goshen . he presented himself to him , and fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
Israel said to Joseph , " Now let me die , since I have seen your face , that you are still alive . "
Joseph said to his brothers , and to his father 's house , " I will go up , and speak with Pharaoh , and will tell him , ' My brothers , and my father 's house , who were in the land of Canaan , have come to me .
these men are shepherds , for they have been keepers of livestock , and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have . '
it will happen , when Pharaoh summons you , and will say , ' What is your occupation ? '
that you shall say , ' Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now , both we , and our fathers : ' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians . "
then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh , and said , " My father and my brothers , with their flocks , their herds , and all that they own , have come out of the land of Canaan ; and behold , they are in the land of Goshen . "
from among his brothers he took five men , and presented them to Pharaoh .
Pharaoh said to his brothers , " What is your occupation ? " they said to Pharaoh , " Your servants are shepherds , both we , and our fathers . "
they said to Pharaoh , " We have come to live as foreigners in the land , for there is no pasture for your servants ' flocks . for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan . now therefore , please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen . "
Pharaoh spoke to Joseph , saying , " Your father and your brothers have come to you .
Joseph brought in Jacob , his father , and set him before Pharaoh , and Jacob blessed Pharaoh .
Pharaoh said to Jacob , " How many are the days of the years of your life ? "
Jacob blessed Pharaoh , and went out from the presence of Pharaoh .
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
Joseph nourished his father , his brothers , and all of his father 's household , with bread , according to their families .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the grain which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came to Joseph , and said , " Give us bread , for why should we die in your presence ? for our money fails . "
Joseph said , " Give me your livestock ; and I will give you food for your livestock , if your money is gone . "
they brought their livestock to Joseph , and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses , and for the flocks , and for the herds , and for the donkeys : and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year .
so Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh , for every man of the Egyptians sold his field , because the famine was severe on them , and the land became Pharaoh 's .
as for the people , he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it .
then Joseph said to the people , " behold , I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh . behold , here is seed for you , and you shall sow the land .
it will happen at the harvests , that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh , and four parts will be your own , for seed of the field , for your food , for them of your households , and for food for your little ones . "
they said , " You have saved our lives ! let us find favor in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh 's servants . "
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth . only the land of the priests alone didn 't become Pharaoh 's .
Israel lived in the land of Egypt , in the land of Goshen ; and they got themselves possessions therein , and were fruitful , and multiplied exceedingly .
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years . so the days of Jacob , the years of his life , were one hundred forty @-@ seven years .
but when I sleep with my fathers , you shall carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their burying place . " he said , " I will do as you have said . "
he said , " swear to me , " and he swore to him . Israel bowed himself on the bed 's head .
it happened after these things , that someone said to Joseph , " behold , your father is sick . " he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
someone told Jacob , and said , " behold , your son Joseph comes to you , " and Israel strengthened himself , and sat on the bed .
Jacob said to Joseph , " God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan , and blessed me ,
and said to me , ' behold , I will make you fruitful , and multiply you , and I will make of you a company of peoples , and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession . '
now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt , are mine ; Ephraim and Manasseh , even as Reuben and Simeon , will be mine .
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yours . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance .
as for me , when I came from Paddan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way , when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath , and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath ( the same is Bethlehem ) . "
Israel saw Joseph 's sons , and said , " Who are these ? "
Joseph said to his father , " They are my sons , whom God has given me here . " he said , " Please bring them to me , and I will bless them . "
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he couldn 't see . he brought them near to him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
Israel said to Joseph , " I didn 't think I would see your face , and behold , God has let me see your seed also . "
Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it on Ephraim 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Manasseh 's head , guiding his hands knowingly , for Manasseh was the firstborn .
he blessed Joseph , and said , " The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked , the God who has fed me all my life long to this day ,
the angel who has redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads , and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac . let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth . "
when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim , it displeased him . he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from Ephraim 's head to Manasseh 's head .
Joseph said to his father , " Not so , my father ; for this is the firstborn ; put your right hand on his head . "
he blessed them that day , saying , " In you will Israel bless , saying , ' God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh ' " He set Ephraim before Manasseh .
Israel said to Joseph , " behold , I am dying , but God will be with you , and bring you again to the land of your fathers .
moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow . "
Jacob called to his sons , and said : " gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come .
assemble yourselves , and hear , you sons of Jacob . listen to Israel , your father .
" Reuben , you are my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength ; excelling in dignity , and excelling in power .
boiling over as water , you shall not excel ; because you went up to your father 's bed , then defiled it . he went up to my couch .
" Simeon and Levi are brothers . their swords are weapons of violence .
my soul , don 't come into their council . my glory , don 't be united to their assembly ; for in their anger they killed men . in their self @-@ will they hamstrung cattle .
Cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel . I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
" Judah , your brothers will praise you . your hand will be on the neck of your enemies . your father 's sons will bow down before you .
Judah is a lion 's cub . from the prey , my son , you have gone up . he stooped down , he crouched as a lion , as a lioness . who will rouse him up ?
the scepter will not depart from Judah , nor the ruler 's staff from between his feet , until he comes to whom it belongs . to him will the obedience of the peoples be .
binding his foal to the vine , his donkey 's colt to the choice vine ; he has washed his garments in wine , his robes in the blood of grapes .
his eyes will be red with wine , his teeth white with milk .
" Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea . he will be for a haven of ships . his border will be on Sidon .
" Issachar is a strong donkey , lying down between the saddlebags .
he saw a resting place , that it was good , the land , that it was pleasant . he bows his shoulder to the burden , and becomes a servant doing forced labor .
" Dan will judge his people , as one of the tribes of Israel .
Dan will be a serpent in the way , an adder in the path , That Bites the horse 's heels , so that his Rider falls backward .
I have waited for your salvation , Yahweh .
" a troop will press on Gad , but he will press on their heel .
" Asher 's food will be rich . he will yield royal dainties .
" Naphtali is a doe set free , who bears beautiful fawns .
" Joseph is a fruitful vine , a fruitful vine by a spring . his branches run over the wall .
the archers have severely grieved him , shot at him , and persecute him :
but his bow remained strong . the arms of his hands were made strong , by the hands of the mighty One of Jacob , ( from there is the shepherd , the stone of Israel ) ,
even by the God of your father , who will help you ; by the Almighty , who will bless you , with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lies below , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb .
the blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors , above the boundaries of the ancient hills . they will be on the head of Joseph , on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers .
" Benjamin is a ravenous wolf . in the morning he will devour the prey . at evening he will divide the spoil . "
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel , and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them . he blessed everyone according to his blessing .
there they buried Abraham and Sarah , his wife . there they buried Isaac and Rebekah , his wife , and there I buried Leah :
the field and the cave that is therein , which was purchased from the children of Heth . "
when Jacob made an end of charging his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the spirit , and was gathered to his people .
Joseph fell on his father 's face , wept on him , and kissed him .
Joseph commanded his servants , the physicians , to embalm his father ; and the physicians embalmed Israel .
forty days were fulfilled for him , for that is how many the days it takes to embalm . the Egyptians wept for him for seventy days .
when the days of weeping for him were past , Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh , saying , " If now I have found favor in your eyes , please speak in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
Pharaoh said , " Go up , and bury your father , just like he made you swear . "
Joseph went up to bury his father ; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father 's house . only their little ones , their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
there went up with him both chariots and horsemen . it was a very great company .
they came to the threshing floor of Atad , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation . he mourned for his father seven days .
his sons did to him just as he commanded them ,
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field , for a possession of a burial site , from Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
Joseph returned into Egypt--he , and his brothers , and all that went up with him to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
his brothers also went and fell down before his face ; and they said , " behold , we are your servants . "
Joseph said to them , " Don 't be afraid , for am I in the place of God ?
as for you , you meant evil against me , but God meant it for good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save many people alive .
now therefore don 't be afraid . I will nourish you and your little ones . " he comforted them , and spoke kindly to them .
Joseph lived in Egypt , he , and his father 's house . Joseph lived one hundred ten years .
Joseph saw Ephraim 's children to the third generation . the children also of Machir , the son of Manasseh , were born on Joseph 's knees .
Joseph said to his brothers , " I am dying , but God will surely visit you , and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob . "
Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel , saying , " God will surely visit you , and you shall carry up my bones from here . "
so Joseph died , being one hundred ten years old , and they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in Egypt .
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jacob ) :
Dan and Naphtali , Gad and Asher .
all the souls who came out of Jacob 's body were seventy souls , and Joseph was in Egypt already .
Joseph died , as did all his brothers , and all that generation .
the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and grew exceedingly mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
now there arose a new king over Egypt , who didn 't know Joseph .
he said to his people , " behold , the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we .
therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens . they built storage cities for Pharaoh : Pithom and Raamses .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and the more they spread out . they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
the Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve ,
and they made their lives bitter with hard service , in mortar and in brick , and in all kinds of service in the field , all their service , in which they ruthlessly made them serve .
the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew Midwives , of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah ,
and he said , " When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women , and see them on the birth stool ; if it is a son , then you shall kill him ; but if it is a daughter , then she shall live . "
but the Midwives feared God , and didn 't do what the king of Egypt commanded them , but saved the baby boys alive .
the king of Egypt called for the Midwives , and said to them , " Why have you done this thing , and have saved the boys alive ? "
the Midwives said to Pharaoh , " Because the Hebrew women aren 't like the Egyptian women ; for they are vigorous , and give birth before the midwife comes to them . "
God dealt well with the Midwives , and the people multiplied , and grew very mighty .
it happened , because the Midwives feared God , that he gave them families .
Pharaoh commanded all his people , saying , " You shall cast every son who is born into the river , and every daughter you shall save alive . "
a man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife .
the woman conceived , and bore a son . when she saw that he was a fine child , she hid him three months .
when she could no longer hide him , she took a papyrus basket for him , and coated it with tar and with pitch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the reeds by the river 's bank .
his sister stood far off , to see what would be done to him .
Pharaoh 's daughter came down to bathe at the river . her maidens walked along by the riverside . she saw the basket among the reeds , and sent her handmaid to get it .
she opened it , and saw the child , and behold , the baby cried . she had compassion on him , and said , " This is one of the Hebrews ' children . "
then his sister said to Pharaoh 's daughter , " Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for you ? "
Pharaoh 's daughter said to her , " Go . " the maiden went and called the child 's mother .
Pharaoh 's daughter said to her , " Take this child away , and nurse him for me , and I will give you your wages . " the woman took the child , and nursed it .
the child grew , and she brought him to Pharaoh 's daughter , and he became her son . she named him Moses , and said , " Because I drew him out of the water . "
it happened in those days , when Moses had grown up , that he went out to his brothers , and looked at their burdens . he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew , one of his brothers .
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
he went out the second day , and behold , two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other . he said to him who did the wrong , " Why do you strike your fellow ? "
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to kill Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and lived in the land of Midian , and he sat down by a well .
now the priest of Midian had seven daughters . they came and drew water , and filled the troughs to water their father 's flock .
the shepherds came and drove them away ; but Moses stood up and helped them , and watered their flock .
when they came to Reuel , their father , he said , " How is it that you have returned so early today ? "
they said , " An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds , and moreover he drew water for us , and watered the flock . "
he said to his daughters , " Where is he ? why is it that you have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread . "
Moses was content to dwell with the man . he gave Moses Zipporah , his daughter .
she bore a son , and he named him Gershom , for he said , " I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land . "
it happened in the course of those many days , that the king of Egypt died , and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage , and they cried , and their cry came up to God because of the bondage .
God heard their groaning , and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham , with Isaac , and with Jacob .
God saw the children of Israel , and God was concerned about them .
now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro , his father @-@ in @-@ law , the priest of Midian , and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness , and came to God 's mountain , to Horeb .
the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush . he looked , and behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
Moses said , " I will turn aside now , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt . "
when Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see , God called to him out of the midst of the bush , and said , " Moses ! Moses ! " he said , " Here I am . "
he said , " Don 't come close . take your sandals off of your feet , for the place you are standing on is holy ground . "
moreover he said , " I am the God of your father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . " Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look at God .
Yahweh said , " I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt , and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters , for I know their sorrows .
I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land , to a land flowing with milk and honey ; to the place of the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
now , behold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them .
come now therefore , and I will send you to Pharaoh , that you may bring my people , the children of Israel , out of Egypt . "
Moses said to God , " Who am I , that I should go to Pharaoh , and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt ? "
Moses said to God , " behold , when I come to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' The God of your fathers has sent me to you ; ' and they ask me , ' What is his name ? ' what should I tell them ? "
God said to Moses , " I AM WHO I AM , " and he said , " You shall tell the children of Israel this : ' I AM has sent me to you . ' "
God said moreover to Moses , " You shall tell the children of Israel this , ' Yahweh , the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has sent me to you . ' this is my name forever , and this is my memorial to all generations .
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite , to a land flowing with milk and honey . " '
I know that the king of Egypt won 't give you permission to go , no , not by a mighty hand .
I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst , and after that he will let you go .
I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , and it will happen that when you go , you shall not go empty @-@ handed .
but every woman shall ask of her neighbor , and of her who visits her house , jewels of silver , jewels of gold , and clothing ; and you shall put them on your sons , and on your daughters . you shall plunder the Egyptians . "
Moses answered , " But , behold , they will not believe me , nor listen to my voice ; for they will say , ' Yahweh has not appeared to you . ' "
he said , " throw it on the ground . " he threw it on the ground , and it became a snake ; and Moses ran away from it .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand , and take it by the tail . " he stretched out his hand , and took hold of it , and it became a rod in his hand .
Yahweh said furthermore to him , " Now put your hand inside your cloak . " he put his hand inside his cloak , and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous , as white as snow .
he said , " Put your hand inside your cloak again . " he put his hand inside his cloak again , and when he took it out of his cloak , behold , it had turned again as his other flesh .
" it will happen , if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
it will happen , if they will not believe even these two signs , neither listen to your voice , that you shall take of the water of the river , and pour it on the dry land . the water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land . "
Yahweh said to him , " Who made man 's mouth ? or who makes one mute , or deaf , or seeing , or blind ? Isn 't it I , Yahweh ?
now therefore go , and I will be with your mouth , and teach you what you shall speak . "
he said , " Oh , Lord , please send someone else . "
you shall speak to him , and put the words in his mouth . I will be with your mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what you shall do .
he will be your spokesman to the people ; and it will happen , that he will be to you a mouth , and you will be to him as God .
you shall take this rod in your hand , with which you shall do the signs . "
Yahweh said to Moses in Midian , " Go , return into Egypt ; for all the men who sought your life are dead . "
Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them on a donkey , and he returned to the land of Egypt . Moses took God 's rod in his hand .
Yahweh said to Moses , " When you go back into Egypt , see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand , but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go .
you shall tell Pharaoh , ' Thus says Yahweh , Israel is my son , my firstborn ,
and I have said to you , " Let my son go , that he may serve me " ; and you have refused to let him go . behold , I will kill your son , your firstborn . ' "
it happened on the way at a lodging place , that Yahweh met Moses and wanted to kill him .
then Zipporah took a Flint , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet ; and she said , " surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me . "
so he let him alone . then she said , " You are a bridegroom of blood , " because of the circumcision .
Yahweh said to Aaron , " Go into the wilderness to meet Moses . " he went , and met him on God 's mountain , and kissed him .
Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which he had sent him , and all the signs with which he had instructed him .
Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel .
Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
the people believed , and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel , and that he had seen their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshiped .
afterward Moses and Aaron came , and said to Pharaoh , " This is what Yahweh , the God of Israel , says , ' Let my people go , that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness . ' "
Pharaoh said , " Who is Yahweh , that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go ? I don 't know Yahweh , and moreover I will not let Israel go . "
the king of Egypt said to them , " Why do you , Moses and Aaron , take the people from their work ? get back to your burdens ! "
Pharaoh said , " behold , the people of the land are now many , and you make them rest from their burdens . "
the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people , and their officers , saying ,
" you shall no longer give the people straw to make brick , as before . let them go and gather straw for themselves .
let heavier work be laid on the men , that they may labor therein ; and don 't let them pay any attention to lying words . "
the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spoke to the people , saying , " This is what Pharaoh says : ' I will not give you straw .
go yourselves , get straw where you can find it , for nothing of your work shall be diminished . ' "
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw .
the taskmasters were urgent saying , " fulfill your work quota daily , as when there was straw ! "
the officers of the children of Israel , whom Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Why haven 't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today , in making brick as before ? "
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh , saying , " Why do you deal this way with your servants ?
no straw is given to your servants , and they tell us , ' Make brick ! ' and behold , your servants are beaten ; but the fault is in your own people . "
but he said , " You are idle ! you are idle ! therefore you say , ' Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh . '
go therefore now , and work , for no straw shall be given to you , yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks ! "
the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble , when it was said , " You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks ! "
they met Moses and Aaron , who stood in the way , as they came out from Pharaoh :
Moses returned to Yahweh , and said , " Lord , why have you brought trouble on this people ? why is it that you have sent me ?
for since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name , he has brought trouble on this people ; neither have you delivered your people at all . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh , for by a strong hand he shall let them go , and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land . "
God spoke to Moses , and said to him , " I am Yahweh ;
and I appeared to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , as God Almighty ; but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them .
I have also established my Covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their travels , in which they lived as aliens .
moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage , and I have remembered my Covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God , who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it to you for a heritage : I am Yahweh . ' "
Moses spoke so to the children of Israel , but they didn 't listen to Moses for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these are the heads of their fathers ' houses . the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel : Hanoch , and Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi ; these are the families of Reuben .
the sons of Simeon : Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations : Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari ; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty @-@ seven years .
the sons of Gershon : Libni and Shimei , according to their families .
the sons of Kohath : Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel ; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty @-@ three years .
the sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . these are the families of the Levites according to their generations .
Amram took Jochebed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty @-@ seven years .
the sons of Izhar : Korah , and Nepheg , and Zichri .
the sons of Uzziel : Mishael , and Elzaphan , and Sithri .
Aaron took Elisheba , the daughter of Amminadab , the sister of Nahshon , as his wife ; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
the sons of Korah : Assir , and Elkanah , and Abiasaph ; these are the families of the Korahites .
Eleazar Aaron 's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife ; and she bore him Phinehas . these are the heads of the fathers ' houses of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom Yahweh said , " Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies . "
these are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Moses and Aaron .
it happened on the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt ,
Moses said before Yahweh , " behold , I am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall Pharaoh listen to me ? "
Yahweh said to Moses , " behold , I have made you as God to Pharaoh ; and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet .
you shall speak all that I command you ; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt .
but Pharaoh will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh , when I stretch out my hand on Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them . "
Moses and Aaron did so . as Yahweh commanded them , so they did .
Moses was eighty years old , and Aaron eighty @-@ three years old , when they spoke to Pharaoh .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
" when Pharaoh speaks to you , saying , ' perform a miracle ! ' then you shall tell Aaron , ' Take your rod , and cast it down before Pharaoh , that it become a serpent . ' "
Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh , and they did so , as Yahweh had commanded : and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants , and it became a serpent .
then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers . they also , the magicians of Egypt , did the same thing with their enchantments .
for they each cast down their rods , and they became Serpents : but Aaron 's rod swallowed up their rods .
Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he didn 't listen to them ; as Yahweh had spoken .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Pharaoh 's heart is stubborn . he refuses to let the people go .
go to Pharaoh in the morning . behold , he goes out to the water ; and you shall stand by the river 's bank to meet him ; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand .
thus says Yahweh , " In this you shall know that I am Yahweh . behold , I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
the fish that are in the river shall die , and the river shall become foul ; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river . " ' "
Moses and Aaron did so , as Yahweh commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and struck the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Pharaoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became foul , and the Egyptians couldn 't drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
the magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments ; and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he didn 't listen to them ; as Yahweh had spoken .
Pharaoh turned and went into his house , and he didn 't even take this to heart .
all the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink ; for they couldn 't drink of the water of the river .
seven days were fulfilled , after Yahweh had struck the river .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , Go in to Pharaoh , and tell him , " This is what Yahweh says , ' Let my people go , that they may serve me .
if you refuse to let them go , behold , I will plague all your borders with frogs :
and the river shall swarm with frogs , which shall go up and come into your house , and into your bedroom , and on your bed , and into the house of your servants , and on your people , and into your ovens , and into your kneading troughs :
and the frogs shall come up both on you , and on your people , and on all your servants . ' "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Tell Aaron , ' Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers , over the streams , and over the pools , and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt . ' "
Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
the magicians did the same thing with their enchantments , and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt .
he said , " Tomorrow . " he said , " Be it according to your word , that you may know that there is none like Yahweh our God .
the frogs shall depart from you , and from your houses , and from your servants , and from your people . they shall remain in the river only . "
Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh , and Moses cried to Yahweh concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh .
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses , and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the courts , and out of the fields .
they gathered them together in heaps , and the land stank .
but when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite , he hardened his heart , and didn 't listen to them , as Yahweh had spoken .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Tell Aaron , ' Stretch out your rod , and strike the dust of the earth , that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt . ' "
they did so ; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and struck the dust of the earth , and there were lice on man , and on animal ; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
the magicians tried with their enchantments to produce lice , but they couldn 't . there were lice on man , and on animal .
then the magicians said to Pharaoh , " This is the finger of God : " and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he didn 't listen to them ; as Yahweh had spoken .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh ; behold , he comes out to the water ; and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh says , " Let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if you will not let my people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies on you , and on your servants , and on your people , and into your houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the earth .
I will put a division between my people and your people : by tomorrow shall this sign be . " ' "
Yahweh did so ; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies .
Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron , and said , " Go , sacrifice to your God in the land ! "
we will go three days ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to Yahweh our God , as he shall command us . "
Pharaoh said , " I will let you go , that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness , only you shall not go very far away . pray for me . "
Moses went out from Pharaoh , and prayed to Yahweh .
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses , and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people . there remained not one .
Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also , and he didn 't let the people go .
then Yahweh said to Moses , " Go in to Pharaoh , and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
for if you refuse to let them go , and hold them still ,
behold , the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field , on the horses , on the donkeys , on the camels , on the herds , and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence .
Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt ; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel . " ' "
Yahweh appointed a set time , saying , " Tomorrow Yahweh shall do this thing in the land . "
Yahweh did that thing on the next day ; and all the livestock of Egypt died , but of the livestock of the children of Israel , not one died .
Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead . but the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn , and he didn 't let the people go .
Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron , " Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh .
it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "
they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky ; and it became a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal .
the magicians couldn 't stand before Moses because of the boils ; for the boils were on the magicians , and on all the Egyptians .
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh , and he didn 't listen to them , as Yahweh had spoken to Moses .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
for this time I will send all my plagues against your heart , against your officials , and against your people ; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth .
for now I would have stretched out my hand , and struck you and your people with pestilence , and you would have been cut off from the earth ;
but indeed for this cause I have made you stand : to show you my power , and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth ;
as you still exalt yourself against my people , that you won 't let them go .
behold , tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now .
those who feared the word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses .
whoever didn 't respect the word of Yahweh left his servants and his livestock in the field .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand toward the sky , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , on man , and on animal , and on every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt . "
Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens , and Yahweh sent Thunder , hail , and lightning flashed down to the earth . Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt .
so there was very severe hail , and lightning mixed with the hail , such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the hail struck every herb of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
only in the land of Goshen , where the children of Israel were , there was no hail .
Pharaoh sent , and called for Moses and Aaron , and said to them , " I have sinned this time . Yahweh is righteous , and I and my people are wicked .
pray to Yahweh ; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail . I will let you go , and you shall stay no longer . "
Moses said to him , " As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh . the thunders shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh 's .
but as for you and your servants , I know that you don 't yet fear Yahweh God . "
the flax and the barley were struck , for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was in bloom .
but the wheat and the spelt were not struck , for they had not grown up .
Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands to Yahweh ; and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured on the earth .
when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go , just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go in to Pharaoh , for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I may show these my signs in their midst ,
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son , and of your son 's son , what things I have done to Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that you may know that I am Yahweh . "
Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh , and said to him , " This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : ' how long will you refuse to humble yourself before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
or else , if you refuse to let my people go , behold , tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country ,
and they shall cover the surface of the earth , so that one won 't be able to see the earth . they shall eat the residue of that which has escaped , which remains to you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field .
your houses shall be filled , and the houses of all your servants , and the houses of all the Egyptians ; as neither your fathers nor your fathers ' fathers have seen , since the day that they were on the earth to this day . ' " he turned , and went out from Pharaoh .
Pharaoh 's servants said to him , " How long will this man be a snare to us ? let the men go , that they may serve Yahweh , their God . Don 't you yet know that Egypt is destroyed ? "
Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh , and he said to them , " Go , serve Yahweh your God ; but who are those who will go ? "
Moses said , " We will go with our young and with our old ; with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh . "
he said to them , " Yahweh be with you if I will let you go with your little ones ! see , evil is clearly before your faces .
not so ! go now you who are men , and serve Yahweh ; for that is what you desire ! " they were driven out from Pharaoh 's presence .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up on the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail has left . "
Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt , and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day , and all the night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very grievous . before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste , and he said , " I have sinned against Yahweh your God , and against you .
now therefore please forgive my sin again , and pray to Yahweh your God , that he may also take away from me this death . "
he went out from Pharaoh , and prayed to Yahweh .
Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind , which took up the locusts , and drove them into the Red Sea . there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt .
but Yahweh hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand toward the sky , that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt , even darkness which may be felt . "
Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky , and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days .
they didn 't see one another , neither did anyone rise from his place for three days ; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
Pharaoh called to Moses , and said , " Go , serve Yahweh . only let your flocks and your herds stay behind . let your little ones also go with you . "
Moses said , " You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God .
but Yahweh hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and he wouldn 't let them go .
Pharaoh said to him , " Get away from me ! be careful to see my face no more ; for in the day you see my face you shall die ! "
Moses said , " You have spoken well . I will see your face again no more . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh , and on Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go . when he lets you go , he will surely thrust you out altogether .
speak now in the ears of the people , and let them ask every man of his neighbor , and every woman of her neighbor , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold . "
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharaoh 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
Moses said , " This is what Yahweh says : ' about midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt ,
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne , even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there has not been , nor shall be any more .
but against any of the children of Israel a dog won 't even bark or move its tongue , against man or animal ; that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel .
all these your servants shall come down to me , and bow down themselves to me , saying , " Get out , with all the people who follow you " ; and after that I will go out . ' " he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Pharaoh won 't listen to you , that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt . "
Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh , and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go out of his land .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt , saying ,
speak to all the Congregation of Israel , saying , ' On the tenth day of this month , they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to their fathers ' houses , a lamb for a household ;
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male a year old . you shall take it from the sheep , or from the goats :
and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the Congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening .
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
they shall eat the flesh in that night , roasted with fire , and unleavened bread . they shall eat it with bitter herbs .
Don 't eat it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but roasted with fire ; with its head , its legs and its inner parts .
you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire .
this is how you shall eat it : with your belt on your waist , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in haste : it is Yahweh 's Passover .
for I will go through the land of Egypt in that night , and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and animal . against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments : I am Yahweh .
" ' seven days you shall eat unleavened bread ; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses , for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation , and in the seventh day a holy convocation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever .
there shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days , for whoever eats that which is leavened , that soul shall be cut off from the Congregation of Israel , whether he be a foreigner , or one who is born in the land .
you shall eat nothing leavened . in all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread . ' "
then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said to them , " Draw out , and take lambs according to your families , and kill the Passover .
you shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the basin , and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin ; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning .
for Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians ; and when he sees the blood on the lintel , and on the two doorposts , Yahweh will pass over the door , and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you .
you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever .
it shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you , according as he has promised , that you shall keep this service .
it will happen , when your children ask you , ' What do you mean by this service ? '
that you shall say , ' It is the sacrifice of Yahweh 's Passover , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he struck the Egyptians , and spared our houses . ' " the people bowed their heads and worshiped .
the children of Israel went and did so ; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron , so they did .
it happened at midnight , that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
he called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , " Rise up , get out from among my people , both you and the children of Israel ; and go , serve Yahweh , as you have said !
take both your flocks and your herds , as you have said , and be gone ; and bless me also ! "
the Egyptians were urgent with the people , to send them out of the land in haste , for they said , " We are all dead men . "
the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders .
the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing .
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they let them have what they asked . they despoiled the Egyptians .
the children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot who were men , besides children .
a mixed multitude went up also with them , with flocks , herds , and even very much livestock .
they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it wasn 't leavened , because they were thrust out of Egypt , and couldn 't wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years .
it happened at the end of four hundred thirty years , even the same day it happened , that all the armies of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt . this is that night of Yahweh , to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations .
Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron , " This is the ordinance of the Passover . no foreigner shall eat of it ,
but every man 's servant who is bought for money , when you have circumcised him , then shall he eat of it .
a foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it .
in one house shall it be eaten ; you shall not carry out anything of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall you break a bone of it .
all the Congregation of Israel shall keep it .
one law shall be to him who is born at home , and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you . "
all the children of Israel did so . as Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron , so they did .
it happened the same day , that Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
Moses said to the people , " Remember this day , in which you came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place . no leavened bread shall be eaten .
this day you go out in the month Abib .
it shall be , when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Amorite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite , which he swore to your fathers to give you , a land flowing with milk and honey , that you shall keep this service in this month .
seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh .
Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days ; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you , neither shall yeast be seen with you , in all your borders .
you shall tell your son in that day , saying , ' It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt . '
it shall be for a sign to you on your hand , and for a memorial between your eyes , that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth ; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt .
you shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year .
" it shall be , when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite , as he swore to you and to your fathers , and shall give it you ,
that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb , and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal . the males shall be Yahweh 's .
every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb ; and if you will not redeem it , then you shall break its neck ; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons .
it shall be , when your son asks you in time to come , saying , ' What is this ? ' that you shall tell him , ' By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt , from the house of bondage ;
it shall be for a sign on your hand , and for symbols between your eyes : for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt . "
but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt .
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him , for he had made the children of Israel swear , saying , " God will surely visit you , and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you . "
they took their journey from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud , to lead them on their way , and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light , that they might go by day and by night :
the pillar of cloud by day , and the pillar of fire by night , didn 't depart from before the people .
Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , ' They are entangled in the land . the wilderness has shut them in . '
I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , and he will follow after them ; and I will get honor over Pharaoh , and over all his armies ; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh . " they did so .
he prepared his chariot , and took his army with him ;
and he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt , and captains over all of them .
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
the Egyptians pursued after them : all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh , his horsemen , and his army ; and overtook them encamping by the sea , beside Pihahiroth , before Baal Zephon .
when Pharaoh drew near , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and behold , the Egyptians were marching after them ; and they were very afraid . the children of Israel cried out to Yahweh .
they said to Moses , " Because there were no graves in Egypt , have you taken us away to die in the wilderness ? why have you treated us this way , to bring us out of Egypt ?
Isn 't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt , saying , ' Leave us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? ' for it were better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness . "
Moses said to the people , " Don 't be afraid . stand still , and see the salvation of Yahweh , which he will work for you today : for the Egyptians whom you have seen today , you shall never see them again .
Yahweh will fight for you , and you shall be still . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Why do you cry to me ? speak to the children of Israel , that they go forward .
lift up your rod , and stretch out your hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground .
I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall go in after them : and I will get myself honor over Pharaoh , and over all his armies , over his chariots , and over his horsemen .
the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh , over his chariots , and over his horsemen . "
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them into the midst of the sea : all of Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
it happened in the morning watch , that Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud , and confused the Egyptian army .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand over the sea , that the waters may come again on the Egyptians , on their chariots , and on their horsemen . "
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it . Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
the waters returned , and covered the chariots and the horsemen , even all Pharaoh 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .
but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore .
Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians , and the people feared Yahweh ; and they believed in Yahweh , and in his servant Moses .
then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh , and said , " I will sing to Yahweh , for he has triumphed gloriously . the horse and his Rider he has thrown into the sea .
Yah is my strength and song . he has become my salvation . this is my God , and I will praise him ; my father 's God , and I will exalt him .
Yahweh is a man of war . Yahweh is his name .
he has cast Pharaoh 's chariots and his army into the sea . his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea .
the deeps cover them . they went down into the depths like a stone .
your right hand , Yahweh , is glorious in power . your right hand , Yahweh , dashes the enemy in pieces .
in the greatness of your excellency , you overthrow those who rise up against you . you send forth your wrath . it consumes them as stubble .
with the blast of your nostrils , the waters were piled up . the floods stood upright as a heap . the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , ' I will pursue . I will overtake . I will divide the spoil . my desire shall be satisfied on them . I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them . '
you blew with your wind . the sea covered them . they sank like lead in the mighty waters .
who is like you , Yahweh , among the gods ? who is like you , glorious in holiness , fearful in praises , doing wonders ?
you stretched out your right hand . the earth swallowed them .
" you , in your loving kindness , have led the people that you have redeemed . you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation .
the peoples have heard . they tremble . pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia .
then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed . Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab . all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away .
terror and dread falls on them . by the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone-- until your people pass over , Yahweh , until the people pass over who you have purchased .
you shall bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance , the place , Yahweh , which you have made for yourself to dwell in ; the sanctuary , Lord , which your hands have established .
for the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them ; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea .
Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a tambourine in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances .
Miriam answered them , " sing to Yahweh , for he has triumphed gloriously . the horse and his Rider he has thrown into the sea . "
Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
when they came to Marah , they couldn 't drink from the waters of Marah , for they were bitter . therefore its name was called Marah .
the people murmured against Moses , saying , " What shall we drink ? "
then he cried to Yahweh . Yahweh showed him a tree , and he threw it into the waters , and the waters were made sweet . there he made a statute and an ordinance for them , and there he tested them ;
they came to Elim , where there were twelve springs of water , and seventy palm trees : and they encamped there by the waters .
they took their journey from Elim , and all the Congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness ;
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , " At evening , then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
and in the morning , then you shall see the glory of Yahweh ; because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh . who are we , that you murmur against us ? "
Moses said to Aaron , " Tell all the Congregation of the children of Israel , ' Come near before Yahweh , for he has heard your murmurings . ' "
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel . speak to them , saying , ' At evening you shall eat meat , and in the morning you shall be filled with bread : and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God . ' "
it happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp ; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp .
when the dew that lay had gone , behold , on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing , small as the Frost on the ground .
when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , " What is it ? " for they didn 't know what it was . Moses said to them , " It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat . "
this is the thing which Yahweh has commanded : " gather of it everyone according to his eating ; an Omer a head , according to the number of your persons , you shall take it , every man for those who are in his tent . "
the children of Israel did so , and gathered some more , some less .
when they measured it with an Omer , he who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little had no lack . they gathered every man according to his eating .
Moses said to them , " Let no one leave of it until the morning . "
notwithstanding they didn 't listen to Moses , but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and became foul : and Moses was angry with them .
they gathered it morning by morning , everyone according to his eating . when the sun grew hot , it melted .
it happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for each one , and all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses .
they laid it up until the morning , as Moses asked , and it didn 't become foul , neither was there any worm in it .
Moses said , " eat that today , for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh . today you shall not find it in the field .
six days you shall gather it , but on the seventh day is the Sabbath . in it there shall be none . "
it happened on the seventh day , that some of the people went out to gather , and they found none .
Yahweh said to Moses , " How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws ?
behold , because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath , therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days . everyone stay in his place . let no one go out of his place on the seventh day . "
so the people rested on the seventh day .
the house of Israel called its name Manna , and it was like coriander seed , white ; and its taste was like wafers with honey .
Moses said to Aaron , " Take a pot , and put an Omer @-@ full of manna in it , and lay it up before Yahweh , to be kept throughout your generations . "
as Yahweh commanded Moses , so Aaron laid it up before the testimony , to be kept .
the children of Israel ate the manna forty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan .
now an Omer is the tenth part of an ephah .
all the Congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of sin , by their journeys , according to Yahweh 's commandment , and encamped in Rephidim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
therefore the people quarreled with Moses , and said , " Give us water to drink . " Moses said to them , " Why do you quarrel with me ? why do you test Yahweh ? "
the people were thirsty for water there ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us , our children , and our livestock with thirst ? "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Walk on before the people , and take the elders of Israel with you , and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile , and go .
behold , I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb . you shall strike the rock , and water will come out of it , that the people may drink . " Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
he called the name of the place Massah , and Meribah , because the children of Israel quarreled , and because they tested Yahweh , saying , " Is Yahweh among us , or not ? "
then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim .
Moses said to Joshua , " Choose men for us , and go out , fight with Amalek . tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God 's rod in my hand . "
so Joshua did as Moses had told him , and fought with Amalek ; and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
it happened , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Write this for a memorial in a book , and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua : that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky . "
Moses built an altar , and called its name Yahweh our banner .
he said , " Yah has sworn : ' Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation . ' "
now Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt .
the name of the other was Eliezer , for he said , " My father 's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh 's sword . "
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped , at the Mountain of God .
he said to Moses , " I , your father @-@ in @-@ law Jethro , have come to you with your wife , and her two sons with her . "
Moses went out to meet his father @-@ in @-@ law , and bowed and kissed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Moses told his father @-@ in @-@ law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , all the hardships that had come on them on the way , and how Yahweh delivered them .
Jethro rejoiced for all the Goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians .
Jethro said , " blessed be Yahweh , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh ; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them . "
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God . Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law before God .
it happened on the next day , that Moses sat to judge the people , and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening .
Moses said to his father @-@ in @-@ law , " Because the people come to me to inquire of God .
when they have a matter , they come to me , and I judge between a man and his neighbor , and I make them know the statutes of God , and his laws . "
Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law said to him , " The thing that you do is not good .
you will surely wear away , both you , and this people that is with you ; for the thing is too heavy for you . you are not able to perform it yourself alone .
listen now to my voice . I will give you counsel , and God be with you . you represent the people before God , and bring the causes to God .
you shall teach them the statutes and the laws , and shall show them the way in which they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God : men of truth , hating unjust gain ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
let them judge the people at all times . it shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you , but every small matter they shall judge themselves . so shall it be easier for you , and they shall share the load with you .
if you will do this thing , and God commands you so , then you will be able to endure , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
so Moses listened to the voice of his father @-@ in @-@ law , and did all that he had said .
Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
they judged the people at all times . they brought the hard causes to Moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
Moses let his father @-@ in @-@ law depart , and he went his way into his own land .
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai .
when they had departed from Rephidim , and had come to the wilderness of Sinai , they encamped in the wilderness ; and there Israel encamped before the mountain .
Moses went up to God , and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians , and how I bore you on eagles ' wings , and brought you to myself .
now therefore , if you will indeed obey my voice , and keep my Covenant , then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples ; for all the earth is mine ;
Moses came and called for the elders of the people , and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him .
all the people answered together , and said , " All that Yahweh has spoken we will do . " Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go to the people , and sanctify them today and tomorrow , and let them wash their garments ,
and be ready against the third day ; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai .
you shall set bounds to the people all around , saying , ' Be careful that you don 't go up onto the mountain , or touch its border . whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death .
Moses went down from the mountain to the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes .
he said to the people , " Be ready by the third day . Don 't have sexual relations with a woman . "
it happened on the third day , when it was morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud on the mountain , and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet ; and all the people who were in the camp trembled .
Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God ; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain .
Mount Sinai , all it , smoked , because Yahweh descended on it in fire ; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mountain quaked greatly .
when the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder , Moses spoke , and God answered him by a voice .
Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai , to the top of the mountain . Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go down , warn the people , lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze , and many of them perish .
let the priests also , who come near to Yahweh , sanctify themselves , lest Yahweh break forth on them . "
Moses said to Yahweh , " The people can 't come up to Mount Sinai , for you warned us , saying , ' Set bounds around the mountain , and sanctify it . ' "
Yahweh said to him , " Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you , but don 't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh , lest he break forth on them . "
so Moses went down to the people , and told them .
God spoke all these words , saying ,
" I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
" you shall have no other gods before me .
" you shall not make for yourselves an idol , nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
you shall not bow yourself down to them , nor serve them , for I , Yahweh your God , am a Jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me ,
and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments .
" you shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain , for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain .
" remember the Sabbath day , to keep it holy .
you shall labor six days , and do all your work ,
but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God . you shall not do any work in it , you , nor your son , nor your daughter , your male servant , nor your female servant , nor your livestock , nor your stranger who is within your gates ;
for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that is in them , and rested the seventh day ; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day , and made it holy .
" honor your father and your mother , that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
" you shall not murder .
" you shall not steal .
" you shall not give false testimony against your neighbor .
" you shall not covet your neighbor 's house . you shall not covet your neighbor 's wife , nor his male servant , nor his female servant , nor his ox , nor his donkey , nor anything that is your neighbor 's . "
all the people perceived the thunderings , the lightnings , the sound of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they trembled , and stayed at a distance .
they said to Moses , " Speak with us yourself , and we will listen ; but don 't let God speak with us , lest we die . "
Moses said to the people , " Don 't be afraid , for God has come to test you , and that his fear may be before you , that you won 't sin . "
the people stayed at a distance , and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was .
Yahweh said to Moses , " This is what you shall tell the children of Israel : ' you yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
you shall make an altar of earth for me , and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings , your sheep and your cattle . in every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you .
if you make me an altar of stone , you shall not build it of cut stones ; for if you lift up your tool on it , you have polluted it .
neither shall you go up by steps to my altar , that your nakedness may not be exposed to it . '
" now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them .
" if you buy a Hebrew servant , he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything .
if he comes in by himself , he shall go out by himself . if he is married , then his wife shall go out with him .
if his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters , the wife and her children shall be her master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
but if the servant shall plainly say , ' I love my master , my wife , and my children . I will not go out free ; '
" if a man sells his daughter to be a female servant , she shall not go out as the male servants do .
if she doesn 't please her master , who has married her to himself , then he shall let her be redeemed . he shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people , since he has dealt deceitfully with her .
if he marries her to his son , he shall deal with her as a daughter .
if he takes another wife to himself , he shall not diminish her food , her clothing , and her marital rights .
if he doesn 't do these three things for her , she may go free without paying any money .
" one who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death ,

if he rises again and walks around with his staff , then he who struck him shall be cleared : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall provide for his healing until he is thoroughly healed .
" if a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod , and he dies under his hand , he shall surely be punished .

" if a bull gores a man or a woman to death , the bull shall surely be stoned , and its flesh shall not be eaten ; but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible .
but if the bull had a habit of goring in the past , and it has been testified to its owner , and he has not kept it in , but it has killed a man or a woman , the bull shall be stoned , and its owner shall also be put to death .
if a ransom is laid on him , then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid on him .
whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter , according to this judgment it shall be done to him .
if the bull gores a male servant or a female servant , thirty shekels of silver shall be given to their master , and the ox shall be stoned .
" if a man opens a pit , or if a man digs a pit and doesn 't cover it , and a bull or a donkey falls into it ,
the owner of the pit shall make it good . he shall give money to its owner , and the dead animal shall be his .
" if one man 's bull injures another 's , so that it dies , then they shall sell the live bull , and divide its price ; and they shall also divide the dead animal .
or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of goring in the past , and its owner has not kept it in , he shall surely pay bull for bull , and the dead animal shall be his own .
" if a man steals an ox or a sheep , and kills it , or sells it ; he shall pay five oxen for an ox , and four sheep for a sheep .
if the thief is found breaking in , and is struck so that he dies , there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him .
if the stolen property is found in his hand alive , whether it is ox , donkey , or sheep , he shall pay double .
" if a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten , and lets his animal loose , and it grazes in another man 's field , he shall make restitution from the best of his own field , and from the best of his own vineyard .
" if fire breaks out , and catches in thorns so that the shocks of grain , or the standing grain , or the field are consumed ; he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution .
" if a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep , and it is stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief is found , he shall pay double .
if the thief isn 't found , then the master of the house shall come near to God , to find out if he hasn 't put his hand to his neighbor 's goods .
" if a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey , an ox , a sheep , or any animal to keep , and it dies or is injured , or driven away , no man seeing it ;
the oath of Yahweh shall be between them both , whether he hasn 't put his hand to his neighbor 's goods ; and its owner shall accept it , and he shall not make restitution .
but if it is stolen from him , he shall make restitution to its owner .
if it is torn in pieces , let him bring it for evidence . he shall not make good that which was torn .
" if a man borrows anything of his neighbor 's , and it is injured , or dies , its owner not being with it , he shall surely make restitution .

and my wrath will grow hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
" if you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor , you shall not be to him as a creditor ; neither shall you charge him interest .
if you take your neighbor 's garment as collateral , you shall restore it to him before the sun goes down ,
for that is his only covering , it is his garment for his skin . what would he sleep in ? it will happen , when he cries to me , that I will hear , for I am gracious .
" you shall not blaspheme God , nor curse a ruler of your people .
" you shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses . " you shall give the firstborn of your sons to me .

" for six years you shall sow your land , and shall gather in its increase ,
" six days you shall do your work , and on the seventh day you shall rest , that your ox and your donkey may have rest , and the son of your handmaid , and the alien may be refreshed .

" you shall observe a feast to me three times a year .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread . seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , as I commanded you , at the time appointed in the month Abib ( for in it you came out from Egypt ) , and no one shall appear before me empty .
three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh .

pay attention to him , and listen to his voice . Don 't provoke him , for he will not pardon your disobedience , for my name is in him .

no one will miscarry or be barren in your land . I will fulfill the number of your days .
I will send my terror before you , and will confuse all the people to whom you come , and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you .
I will send the hornet before you , which will drive out the Hivite , the Canaanite , and the Hittite , from before you .
I will not drive them out from before you in one year , lest the land become desolate , and the animals of the field multiply against you .
little by little I will drive them out from before you , until you have increased and inherit the land .
I will set your border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines , and from the wilderness to the River ; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand , and you shall drive them out before you .
you shall make no Covenant with them , nor with their gods .
they shall not dwell in your land , lest they make you sin against me , for if you serve their gods , it will surely be a snare to you . "
he said to Moses , " Come up to Yahweh , you , and Aaron , Nadab , and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship from a distance .
Moses alone shall come near to Yahweh , but they shall not come near , neither shall the people go up with him . "
Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh , and all the ordinances ; and all the people answered with one voice , and said , " All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do . "
Moses wrote all the words of Yahweh , and rose up early in the morning , and built an altar under the mountain , and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel .
he sent young men of the children of Israel , who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of cattle to Yahweh .
Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins , and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar .
he took the book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people , and they said , " All that Yahweh has spoken will we do , and be obedient . "
Moses took the blood , and sprinkled it on the people , and said , " Look , this is the blood of the Covenant , which Yahweh has made with you concerning all these words . "
then Moses , Aaron , Nadab , Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel went up .
they saw the God of Israel . under his feet was like a paved work of sapphire stone , like the skies for clearness .
he didn 't lay his hand on the nobles of the children of Israel . they saw God , and ate and drank .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Come up to me on the mountain , and stay here , and I will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commands that I have written , that you may teach them . "
Moses rose up with Joshua , his servant , and Moses went up onto God 's Mountain .
he said to the elders , " wait here for us , until we come again to you . behold , Aaron and Hur are with you . whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them . "
Moses went up on the mountain , and the cloud covered the mountain .
the glory of Yahweh settled on Mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it six days . the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud .
the appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel .
Moses entered into the midst of the cloud , and went up on the mountain ; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , that they take an offering for me . from everyone whose heart makes him willing you shall take my offering .

and you shall set the turban on his head , and put the holy crown on the turban .
you shall bring his sons , and put coats on them .
you shall clothe them with belts , Aaron and his sons , and bind headbands on them : and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute : and you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons .
" you shall bring the bull before the tent of Meeting : and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull .
you shall kill the bull before Yahweh , at the door of the tent of Meeting .
you shall take of the blood of the bull , and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger ; and you shall pour out all the blood at the base of the altar .
you shall take all the fat that covers the innards , the cover of the liver , the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , and burn them on the altar .
but the flesh of the bull , and its skin , and its Dung , you shall burn with fire outside of the camp : it is a sin offering .
" you shall also take the one ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram .
you shall kill the ram , and you shall take its blood , and sprinkle it around on the altar .
you shall cut the ram into its pieces , and wash its innards , and its legs , and put them with its pieces , and with its head .
you shall burn the whole ram on the altar : it is a burnt offering to Yahweh ; it is a pleasant aroma , an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
" you shall take the other ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram .
then you shall kill the ram , and take some of its blood , and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron , and on the tip of the right ear of his sons , and on the thumb of their right hand , and on the big toe of their right foot , and sprinkle the blood around on the altar .
you shall take of the blood that is on the altar , and of the anointing oil , and sprinkle it on Aaron , and on his garments , and on his sons , and on the garments of his sons with him : and he shall be made holy , and his garments , and his sons , and his sons ' garments with him .
also you shall take some of the ram 's fat , the fat tail , the fat that covers the innards , the cover of the liver , the two kidneys , the fat that is on them , and the right thigh ( for it is a ram of consecration ) ,
and one loaf of bread , one cake of oiled bread , and one wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Yahweh .
you shall put all of this in Aaron 's hands , and in his sons ' hands , and shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh .
you shall take them from their hands , and burn them on the altar on the burnt offering , for a pleasant aroma before Yahweh : it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
" you shall take the breast of Aaron 's ram of consecration , and wave it for a wave offering before Yahweh : and it shall be your portion .
you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering , and the thigh of the wave offering , which is waved , and which is heaved up , of the ram of consecration , even of that which is for Aaron , and of that which is for his sons :
and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as their portion forever from the children of Israel ; for it is a wave offering : and it shall be a wave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace offerings , even their wave offering to Yahweh .
" the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him , to be anointed in them , and to be consecrated in them .
seven days shall the son who is priest in his place put them on , when he comes into the tent of Meeting to minister in the holy place .
" you shall take the ram of consecration , and boil its flesh in a holy place .
they shall eat those things with which Atonement was made , to consecrate and sanctify them : but a stranger shall not eat of it , because they are holy .
if anything of the flesh of the consecration , or of the bread , remains to the morning , then you shall burn the remainder with fire : it shall not be eaten , because it is holy .
" you shall do so to Aaron , and to his sons , according to all that I have commanded you . you shall consecrate them seven days .
every day you shall offer the bull of sin offering for Atonement : and you shall cleanse the altar , when you make Atonement for it ; and you shall anoint it , to sanctify it .
seven days you shall make Atonement for the altar , and sanctify it : and the altar shall be most holy ; whatever touches the altar shall be holy .
" now this is that which you shall offer on the altar : two lambs a year old day by day continually .
the one lamb you shall offer in the morning ; and the other lamb you shall offer at evening :
and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil , and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering .
the other lamb you shall offer at evening , and shall do to it according to the meal offering of the morning , and according to its drink offering , for a pleasant aroma , an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
it shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of Meeting before Yahweh , where I will meet with you , to speak there to you .
there I will meet with the children of Israel ; and the place shall be sanctified by my glory .
I will sanctify the tent of Meeting and the altar : Aaron also and his sons I will sanctify , to minister to me in the priest 's office .
I will dwell among the children of Israel , and will be their God .
they shall know that I am Yahweh their God , who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I might dwell among them : I am Yahweh their God .
" you shall make an altar to burn incense on . you shall make it of acacia wood .
its length shall be a cubit , and its breadth a cubit . it shall be square , and its height shall be two cubits . its horns shall be of one piece with it .
you shall overlay it with pure gold , its top , its sides around it , and its horns ; and you shall make a gold molding around it .
you shall make two golden rings for it under its molding ; on its two ribs , on its two sides you shall make them ; and they shall be for places for poles with which to bear it .
you shall make the poles of acacia wood , and overlay them with gold .
you shall put it before the veil that is by the Ark of the testimony , before the mercy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with you .
Aaron shall burn incense of sweet spices on it every morning . when he tends the lamps , he shall burn it .
when Aaron lights the lamps at evening , he shall burn it , a perpetual incense before Yahweh throughout your generations .
you shall offer no strange incense on it , nor burnt offering , nor meal offering ; and you shall pour no drink offering on it .
Aaron shall make Atonement on its horns once in the year ; with the blood of the sin offering of Atonement once in the year he shall make Atonement for it throughout your generations . it is most holy to Yahweh . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" when you take a census of the children of Israel , according to those who are numbered among them , then each man shall give a ransom for his soul to Yahweh , when you number them ; that there be no plague among them when you number them .
they shall give this , everyone who passes over to those who are numbered , half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary ; ( the shekel is twenty gerahs ; ) half a shekel for an offering to Yahweh .
everyone who passes over to those who are numbered , from twenty years old and upward , shall give the offering to Yahweh .
the rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less , than the half shekel , when they give the offering of Yahweh , to make Atonement for your souls .
you shall take the Atonement money from the children of Israel , and shall appoint it for the service of the tent of Meeting ; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh , to make Atonement for your souls . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" you shall also make a basin of brass , and its base of brass , in which to wash . you shall put it between the tent of Meeting and the altar , and you shall put water in it .
Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it .
moreover Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" also take fine spices : of liquid myrrh , five hundred shekels ; and of fragrant Cinnamon half as much , even two hundred and fifty ; and of fragrant cane , two hundred and fifty ;
and of cassia five hundred , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; and a hin of olive oil .
you shall make it a holy anointing oil , a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer : it shall be a holy anointing oil .
you shall sanctify them , that they may be most holy . whatever touches them shall be holy .
you shall anoint Aaron and his sons , and sanctify them , that they may minister to me in the priest 's office .
you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' This shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations .
it shall not be poured on man 's flesh , neither shall you make any like it , according to its composition : it is holy . it shall be holy to you .
whoever compounds any like it , or whoever puts any of it on a stranger , he shall be cut off from his people . ' "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Take to yourself sweet spices , gum resin , and onycha , and galbanum ; sweet spices with pure frankincense : there shall be an equal weight of each ;
and you shall make incense of it , a perfume after the art of the perfumer , seasoned with salt , pure and holy :
and you shall beat some of it very small , and put some of it before the testimony in the tent of Meeting , where I will meet with you . it shall be to you most holy .
the incense which you shall make , according to its composition you shall not make for yourselves : it shall be to you holy for Yahweh .
whoever shall make any like that , to smell of it , he shall be cut off from his people . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" behold , I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah :
and I have filled him with the Spirit of God , in wisdom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all kinds of workmanship ,
to devise skillful works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
and in cutting of stones for setting , and in carving of wood , to work in all kinds of workmanship .
I , behold , I have appointed with him Oholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan ; and in the heart of all who are wise @-@ hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded you :
the tent of Meeting , the Ark of the testimony , the mercy seat that is on it , all the furniture of the tent ,
the table and its vessels , the pure lampstand with all its vessels , the altar of incense ,
the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels , the basin and its base ,
the finely worked garments--the holy garments for Aaron the priest--the garments of his sons to minister in the priest 's office ,
the anointing oil , and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place : according to all that I have commanded you they shall do . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak also to the children of Israel , saying , ' Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations ; that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you .
you shall keep the Sabbath therefore ; for it is holy to you . everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death ; for whoever does any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest , holy to Yahweh . whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death .
therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath , to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations , for a perpetual Covenant .
it is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever ; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refreshed . ' "
he gave to Moses , when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai , the two tablets of the testimony , stone tablets , written with God 's finger .
Aaron said to them , " Take off the golden rings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them to me . "
all the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears , and brought them to Aaron .
he received what they handed him , and fashioned it with an engraving tool , and made it a molten calf ; and they said , " These are your gods , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . "
when Aaron saw this , he built an altar before it ; and Aaron made a proclamation , and said , " Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh . "
they rose up early on the next day , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , " Go , get down ; for your people , who you brought up out of the land of Egypt , have corrupted themselves !
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them . they have made themselves a molten calf , and have worshiped it , and have sacrificed to it , and said , ' These are your gods , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . ' "
Yahweh said to Moses , " I have seen these people , and behold , they are a stiff @-@ necked people .
now therefore leave me alone , that my wrath may burn hot against them , and that I may consume them ; and I will make of you a great nation . "
Moses begged Yahweh his God , and said , " Yahweh , why does your wrath burn hot against your people , that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand ?
why should the Egyptians speak , saying , ' He brought them forth for evil , to kill them in the mountains , and to consume them from the surface of the earth ? ' turn from your fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against your people .
Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people .
Moses turned , and went down from the mountain , with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand ; tablets that were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other they were written .
the tablets were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , engraved on the tables .
when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said to Moses , " There is the noise of war in the camp . "
he said , " It isn 't the voice of those who shout for victory , neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome ; but the noise of those who sing that I hear . "
it happened , as soon as he came near to the camp , that he saw the calf and the dancing : and Moses ' anger grew hot , and he threw the tablets out of his hands , and broke them beneath the mountain .
he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it with fire , ground it to powder , and scattered it on the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
Moses said to Aaron , " What did these people do to you , that you have brought a great sin on them ? "
Aaron said , " Don 't let the anger of my lord grow hot . you know the people , that they are set on evil .
for they said to me , ' Make us gods , which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we don 't know what has become of him . '
I said to them , ' Whoever has any gold , let them take it off : ' so they gave it to me ; and I threw it into the fire , and out came this calf . "
when Moses saw that the people had broken loose , ( for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies ) ,
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , " Whoever is on Yahweh 's side , come to me ! " all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him .
he said to them , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' Every man put his sword on his thigh , and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp , and every man kill his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbor . ' "
the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
Moses said , " Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh , yes , every man against his son , and against his brother ; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day . "
it happened on the next day , that Moses said to the people , " You have sinned a great sin . now I will go up to Yahweh . perhaps I shall make Atonement for your sin . "
Moses returned to Yahweh , and said , " Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made themselves gods of gold .
yet now , if you will , forgive their sin--and if not , please blot me out of your book which you have written . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Whoever has sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book .
now go , lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you . behold , my angel shall go before you . nevertheless in the day when I punish , I will punish them for their sin . "
Yahweh struck the people , because they made the calf , which Aaron made .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , " depart , go up from here , you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt , to the land of which I swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , ' I will give it to your seed . '
when the people heard this evil news , they mourned : and no one put on his jewelry .
the children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward .
now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp , far away from the camp , and he called it " The tent of Meeting . " it happened that everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the tent of Meeting , which was outside the camp .
it happened that when Moses went out to the tent , that all the people rose up , and stood , everyone at their tent door , and watched Moses , until he had gone into the tent .
it happened , when Moses entered into the tent , that the pillar of cloud descended , stood at the door of the tent , and spoke with Moses .
all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent , and all the people rose up and worshiped , everyone at their tent door .
Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face , as a man speaks to his friend . he turned again into the camp , but his servant Joshua , the son of nun , a young man , didn 't depart out of the tent .
now therefore , if I have found favor in your sight , please show me now your ways , that I may know you , so that I may find favor in your sight : and consider that this nation is your people . "
he said , " My presence will go with you , and I will give you rest . "
he said to him , " If your presence doesn 't go with me , don 't carry us up from here .
Yahweh said to Moses , " I will do this thing also that you have spoken ; for you have found favor in my sight , and I know you by name . "
he said , " Please show me your glory . "
he said , " I will make all my Goodness pass before you , and will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you . I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious , and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy . "
he said , " You cannot see my face , for man may not see me and live . "
Yahweh also said , " behold , there is a place by me , and you shall stand on the rock .
it will happen , while my glory passes by , that I will put you in a cleft of the rock , and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by ;
then I will take away my hand , and you will see my back ; but my face shall not be seen . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Chisel two stone tablets like the first : and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets , which you broke .
be ready by the morning , and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai , and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain .
no one shall come up with you ; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain ; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountain . "
he chiseled two tablets of stone like the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up to Mount Sinai , as Yahweh had commanded him , and took in his hand two stone tablets .
Yahweh descended in the cloud , and stood with him there , and proclaimed the name of Yahweh .
Yahweh passed by before him , and proclaimed , " Yahweh ! Yahweh , a merciful and gracious God , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness and truth ,
keeping loving kindness for thousands , forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin ; and that will by no means clear the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , and on the children 's children , on the third and on the fourth generation . "
Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth , and worshiped .
observe that which I command you this day . behold , I drive out before you the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
be careful , lest you make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going , lest it be for a snare in the midst of you :
but you shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars , and you shall cut down their Asherim ;
for you shall worship no other god : for Yahweh , whose name is Jealous , is a Jealous God .
" Don 't make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land , lest they play the prostitute after their gods , and sacrifice to their gods , and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice ;
and you take of their daughters to your sons , and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods , and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods .
" you shall make no cast idols for yourselves .
" you shall keep the feast of unleavened bread . seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , as I commanded you , at the time appointed in the month Abib ; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt .
" all that opens the womb is mine ; and all your livestock that is male , the firstborn of cow and sheep .
the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb : and if you will not redeem it , then you shall break its neck . all the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem . no one shall appear before me empty .
" six days you shall work , but on the seventh day you shall rest : in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest .
" you shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of harvest at the year 's end .
three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh , the God of Israel .
for I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders ; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh , your God , three times in the year .
" you shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning .
" you shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God . " you shall not boil a young goat in its mother 's milk . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Write you these words : for in accordance with these words I have made a Covenant with you and with Israel . "
he was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights ; he neither ate bread , nor drank water . he wrote on the tablets the words of the Covenant , the ten commandments .
it happened , when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses ' hand , when he came down from the mountain , that Moses didn 't know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him .
when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come near him .
Moses called to them , and Aaron and all the rulers of the Congregation returned to him ; and Moses spoke to them .
afterward all the children of Israel came near , and he gave them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai .
when Moses was done speaking with them , he put a veil on his face .
but when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him , he took the veil off , until he came out ; and he came out , and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
the children of Israel saw Moses ' face , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the veil on his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
Moses assembled all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and said to them , " These are the words which Yahweh has commanded , that you should do them .
'Six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you , a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh : whoever does any work in it shall be put to death .
you shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the Sabbath day . ' "
Moses spoke to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yahweh commanded , saying ,
oil for the light , spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense ,
onyx stones , and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate .
" ' let every wise @-@ hearted man among you come , and make all that Yahweh has commanded :
the tabernacle , its outer covering , its roof , its clasps , its boards , its bars , its pillars , and its sockets ;
the Ark , and its poles , the mercy seat , the veil of the screen ;
the table with its poles and all its vessels , and the show bread ;
the lampstand also for the light , with its vessels , its lamps , and the oil for the light ;
and the altar of incense with its poles , the anointing oil , the sweet incense , the screen for the door , at the door of the tabernacle ;
the altar of burnt offering , with its grating of brass , it poles , and all its vessels , the basin and its base ;
the hangings of the court , its pillars , their sockets , and the screen for the gate of the court ;
the pins of the tabernacle , the pins of the court , and their cords ;
the finely worked garments , for ministering in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office . ' "
all the Congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses .
they came , everyone whose heart stirred him up , and everyone whom his spirit made willing , and brought Yahweh 's offering , for the work of the tent of Meeting , and for all of its service , and for the holy garments .
everyone , with whom was found blue , purple , scarlet , fine linen , goats ' hair , rams ' skins dyed red , and sea cow hides , brought them .
everyone who offered an offering of silver and brass brought Yahweh 's offering ; and everyone , with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service , brought it .
all the women who were wise @-@ hearted spun with their hands , and brought that which they had spun , the blue , the purple , the scarlet , and the fine linen .
all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats ' hair .
the rulers brought the onyx stones , and the stones to be set , for the ephod and for the breastplate ;
and the spice , and the oil for the light , for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense .
the children of Israel brought a freewill offering to Yahweh ; every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work , which Yahweh had commanded to be made by Moses .
Moses said to the children of Israel , " behold , Yahweh has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah .
he has filled him with the Spirit of God , in wisdom , in understanding , in knowledge , and in all kinds of workmanship ;
and to make skillful works , to work in gold , in silver , in brass ,
in cutting of stones for setting , and in carving of wood , to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship .
he has put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and Oholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan .
Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab , and every wise @-@ hearted man , in whose heart Yahweh had put wisdom , even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it :
all the wise men , who performed all the work of the sanctuary , each came from his work which they did .
they spoke to Moses , saying , " The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Yahweh commanded to make . "
for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it , and too much .
all the wise @-@ hearted men among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains ; of fine twined linen , blue , purple , and scarlet , with cherubim , the work of the skillful workman , they made them .
the length of each curtain was twenty @-@ eight cubits , and the breadth of each curtain four cubits . all the curtains had one measure .
he coupled five curtains to one another , and the other five curtains he coupled one to another .
he made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the edge in the coupling . likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling .
he made fifty loops in the one curtain , and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling . the loops were opposite one to another .
he made fifty clasps of gold , and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps : so the tabernacle was a unit .
he made curtains of goats ' hair for a covering over the tabernacle . he made them eleven curtains .
the length of each curtain was thirty cubits , and four cubits the breadth of each curtain . the eleven curtains had one measure .
he coupled five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves .
he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling , and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain which was outmost in the second coupling .
he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together , that it might be a unit .
he made a covering for the tent of rams ' skins dyed red , and a covering of sea cow hides above .
he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood , standing up .
ten cubits was the length of a board , and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board .
each board had two tenons , joined one to another . he made all the boards of the tabernacle this way .
he made the boards for the tabernacle : twenty boards for the south side southward .
he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for its two tenons , and two sockets under another board for its two tenons .
for the second side of the tabernacle , on the north side , he made twenty boards ,
for the far part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards .
he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle in the far part .
they were double beneath , and in the same way they were all the way to its top to one ring . he did this to both of them in the two corners .
there were eight boards , and their sockets of silver , sixteen sockets ; under every board two sockets .
he made bars of acacia wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other .
he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold for places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
he made the veil of blue , purple , scarlet , and fine twined linen : with cherubim . he made it the work of a skillful workman .
he made four pillars of acacia for it , and overlaid them with gold . their hooks were of gold . he cast four sockets of silver for them .
he made a screen for the door of the tent , of blue , purple , scarlet , and fine twined linen , the work of an embroiderer ;
and the five pillars of it with their hooks . he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold , and their five sockets were of brass .
Bezalel made the Ark of acacia wood . its length was two and a half cubits , and its breadth a cubit and a half , and a cubit and a half its height .
he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside , and made a molding of gold for it around it .
he cast four rings of gold for it , in its four feet ; even two rings on its one side , and two rings on its other side .
he made poles of acacia wood , and overlaid them with gold .
he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the Ark , to bear the Ark .
he made a mercy seat of pure gold . its length was two and a half cubits , and a cubit and a half its breadth .
he made two cherubim of gold . he made them of beaten work , at the two ends of the mercy seat ;
one cherub at the one end , and one cherub at the other end . he made the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at its two ends .
the cherubim spread out their wings on high , covering the mercy seat with their wings , with their faces toward one another . the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat .

when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward , throughout all their journeys ;
but if the cloud wasn 't taken up , then they didn 't travel until the day that it was taken up .
for the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day , and there was fire in the cloud by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their journeys .

if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day , it will not be accepted , neither shall it be imputed to him who offers it . it will be an abomination , and the soul who eats any of it will bear his iniquity .
" ' the flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten . it shall be burned with fire . as for the flesh , everyone who is clean may eat it ;
but the soul who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings , that belongs to Yahweh , having his uncleanness on him , that soul shall be cut off from his people .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' You shall eat no fat , of bull , or sheep , or goat .
the fat of that which dies of itself , and the fat of that which is torn of animals , may be used for any other service , but you shall in no way eat of it .
for whoever eats the fat of the animal , of which men offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh , even the soul who eats it shall be cut off from his people .
you shall not eat any blood , whether it is of bird or of animal , in any of your dwellings .
whoever it is who eats any blood , that soul shall be cut off from his people . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to Yahweh shall bring his offering to Yahweh out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings .
with his own hands he shall bring the offerings of Yahweh made by fire . he shall bring the fat with the breast , that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before Yahweh .
the priest shall burn the fat on the altar , but the breast shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' .
the right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings .
he among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings , and the fat , shall have the right thigh for a portion .
for the waved breast and the heaved thigh I have taken from the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings , and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their portion forever from the children of Israel . ' "
this is the anointing portion of Aaron , and the anointing portion of his sons , out of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister to Yahweh in the priest 's office ;
which Yahweh commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he anointed them . it is their portion forever throughout their generations .
this is the law of the burnt offering , of the meal offering , and of the sin offering , and of the trespass offering , and of the consecration , and of the sacrifice of peace offerings ;
which Yahweh commanded Moses in Mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their offerings to Yahweh , in the wilderness of Sinai .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Moses did as Yahweh commanded him ; and the Congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of Meeting .
Moses said to the Congregation , " This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded to be done . "
Moses brought Aaron and his sons , and washed them with water .
he put the coat on him , tied the sash on him , clothed him with the robe , put the ephod on him , and he tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod on him , and fastened it to him with it .
he placed the breastplate on him ; and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim .
he set the turban on his head ; and on the turban , in front , he set the golden plate , the holy crown ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
Moses took the anointing oil , and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it , and sanctified them .
he sprinkled it on the altar seven times , and anointed the altar and all its vessels , and the basin and its base , to sanctify them .
he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron 's head , and anointed him , to sanctify him .
Moses brought Aaron 's sons , and clothed them with coats , and tied sashes on them , and put headbands on them ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
he brought the bull of the sin offering , and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering .
he killed it ; and Moses took the blood , and put it around on the horns of the altar with his finger , and purified the altar , and poured out the blood at the base of the altar , and sanctified it , to make Atonement for it .
he took all the fat that was on the innards , and the cover of the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat ; and Moses burned it on the altar .
but the bull , and its skin , and its flesh , and its Dung , he burned with fire outside the camp ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
he presented the ram of the burnt offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram .
he killed it ; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar .
he cut the ram into its pieces ; and Moses burned the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
he washed the innards and the legs with water ; and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar . it was a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma . it was an offering made by fire to Yahweh ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
he presented the other ram , the ram of consecration : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram .
he killed it ; and Moses took some of its blood , and put it on the tip of Aaron 's right ear , and on the thumb of his right hand , and on the great toe of his right foot .
he brought Aaron 's sons ; and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear , and on the thumb of their right hand , and on the great toe of their right foot ; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar .
he took the fat , and the fat tail , and all the fat that was on the innards , and the cover of the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and the right thigh ;
and out of the basket of unleavened bread , that was before Yahweh , he took one unleavened cake , and one cake of oiled bread , and one wafer , and placed them on the fat , and on the right thigh .
he put all these in Aaron 's hands and in his sons ' hands , and waved them for a wave offering before Yahweh .
Moses took them from their hands , and burned them on the altar on the burnt offering . they were a consecration for a pleasant aroma . it was an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
Moses took the breast , and waved it for a wave offering before Yahweh . it was Moses ' portion of the ram of consecration , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
Moses took some of the anointing oil , and some of the blood which was on the altar , and sprinkled it on Aaron , on his garments , and on his sons , and on his sons ' garments with him , and sanctified Aaron , his garments , and his sons , and his sons ' garments with him .
what remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire .
you shall not go out from the door of the tent of Meeting seven days , until the days of your consecration are fulfilled : for he shall consecrate you seven days .
what has been done this day , so Yahweh has commanded to do , to make Atonement for you .
you shall stay at the door of the tent of Meeting day and night seven days , and keep Yahweh 's command , that you don 't die : for so I am commanded . "
Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh commanded by Moses .
it happened on the eighth day , that Moses called Aaron and his sons , and the elders of Israel ;
and he said to Aaron , " Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering , without blemish , and offer them before Yahweh .
you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' Take a male goat for a sin offering ; and a calf and a lamb , both a year old , without blemish , for a burnt offering ;
and a bull and a ram for peace offerings , to sacrifice before Yahweh ; and a meal offering mixed with oil : for today Yahweh appears to you . ' "
they brought what Moses commanded before the tent of Meeting : and all the Congregation drew near and stood before Yahweh .
Moses said , " This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do : and the glory of Yahweh shall appear to you . "
so Aaron drew near to the altar , and killed the calf of the sin offering , which was for himself .
the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him ; and he dipped his finger in the blood , and put it on the horns of the altar , and poured out the blood at the base of the altar :
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the cover from the liver of the sin offering , he burned upon the altar ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp .
he killed the burnt offering ; and Aaron 's sons delivered the blood to him , and he sprinkled it around on the altar .
they delivered the burnt offering to him , piece by piece , and the head : and he burned them upon the altar .
he washed the innards and the legs , and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar .
he presented the people 's offering , and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people , and killed it , and offered it for sin , like the first .
he presented the burnt offering , and offered it according to the ordinance .
he presented the meal offering , and filled his hand from there , and burned it upon the altar , besides the burnt offering of the morning .
he also killed the bull and the ram , the sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and Aaron 's sons delivered to him the blood , which he sprinkled around on the altar ,
and the fat of the bull and of the ram , the fat tail , and that which covers the innards , and the kidneys , and the cover of the liver :
and they put the fat upon the breasts , and he burned the fat on the altar :
and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Yahweh , as Moses commanded .
Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people , and blessed them ; and he came down from offering the sin offering , and the burnt offering , and the peace offerings .
Moses and Aaron went into the tent of Meeting , and came out , and blessed the people : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people .
there came forth fire from before Yahweh , and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar : and when all the people saw it , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
Nadab and Abihu , the sons of Aaron , each took his censer , and put fire in it , and laid incense on it , and offered strange fire before Yahweh , which he had not commanded them .
and fire came forth from before Yahweh , and devoured them , and they died before Yahweh .
then Moses said to Aaron , " This is what Yahweh spoke of , saying , ' I will show myself holy to those who come near me , and before all the people I will be glorified . ' " Aaron held his peace .
Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said to them , " Draw near , carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp . "
so they drew near , and carried them in their coats out of the camp , as Moses had said .
you shall not go out from the door of the tent of Meeting , lest you die ; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you . " they did according to the word of Moses .
Yahweh spoke to Aaron , saying ,
" drink no wine nor strong drink , you , nor your sons with you , when you go into the tent of Meeting , that you don 't die : it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations :
and that you are to make a distinction between the holy and the common , and between the unclean and the clean ;
and that you are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses . "
Moses spoke to Aaron , and to Eleazar and to Ithamar , his sons who were left , " Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire , and eat it without yeast beside the altar ; for it is most holy ;
and you shall eat it in a holy place , because it is your portion , and your sons ' portion , of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire : for so I am commanded .
behold , its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary : you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary , as I commanded . "
when Moses heard that , it was pleasing in his sight .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying to them ,
" speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' These are the living things which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth .
whatever parts the hoof , and is cloven @-@ footed , and chews the cud among the animals , that you may eat .
" ' nevertheless these you shall not eat of those that chew the cud , or of those who part the hoof : the Camel , because he chews the cud but doesn 't have a parted hoof , he is unclean to you .
the coney , because he chews the cud but doesn 't have a parted hoof , he is unclean to you .
the hare , because she chews the cud but doesn 't part the hoof , she is unclean to you .
the pig , because he has a split hoof , and is cloven @-@ footed , but doesn 't chew the cud , he is unclean to you .
of their flesh you shall not eat , and their carcasses you shall not touch ; they are unclean to you .
" ' these you may eat of all that are in the waters : whatever has fins and scales in the waters , in the seas , and in the rivers , that you may eat .
all that don 't have fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of all the living creatures that are in the waters , they are an abomination to you ,
and you detest them . you shall not eat of their flesh , and you shall detest their carcasses .
whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters , that is an abomination to you .
" ' these you shall detest among the birds ; they shall not be eaten , they are an abomination : the eagle , and the vulture , and the black vulture ,
and the red kite , any kind of black kite ,
any kind of raven ,
the horned owl , the screech owl , and the Gull , any kind of hawk ,
the white owl , the desert owl , the osprey ,
the stork , any kind of heron , the hoopoe , and the BAT .
" ' all flying insects that walk on all fours are an abomination to you .
yet you may eat these : of all winged creeping things that go on all fours , which have legs above their feet , with which to hop on the earth .
even of these you may eat : any kind of locust , any kind of katydid , any kind of cricket , and any kind of grasshopper .
but all winged creeping things which have four feet , are an abomination to you .
" ' by these you will become unclean : whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening .
whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the evening .
" ' every animal which parts the hoof , and is not cloven @-@ footed , nor chews the cud , is unclean to you . everyone who touches them shall be unclean .
whatever goes on its paws , among all animals that go on all fours , they are unclean to you . whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening .
he who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the evening . they are unclean to you .
" ' these are they which are unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth : the weasel , the rat , any kind of great lizard ,
these are they which are unclean to you among all that creep . whoever touches them when they are dead , shall be unclean until the evening .
every earthen vessel , into which any of them falls , all that is in it shall be unclean , and you shall break it .
all food which may be eaten , that on which water comes , shall be unclean ; and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean .
everything whereupon part of their carcass falls shall be unclean ; whether oven , or range for pots , it shall be broken in pieces : they are unclean , and shall be unclean to you .
nevertheless a spring or a cistern in which water is a gathered shall be clean : but that which touches their carcass shall be unclean .
if part of their carcass falls on any sowing seed which is to be sown , it is clean .
but if water is put on the seed , and part of their carcass falls on it , it is unclean to you .
" ' if any animal , of which you may eat , dies ; he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening .
he who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the evening . he also who carries its carcass shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the evening .
" ' every creeping thing that creeps on the earth is an abomination . it shall not be eaten .
whatever goes on its belly , and whatever goes on all fours , or whatever has many feet , even all creeping things that creep on the earth , them you shall not eat ; for they are an abomination .
you shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps , neither shall you make yourselves unclean with them , that you should be defiled thereby .
for I am Yahweh your God . Sanctify yourselves therefore , and be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall you defile yourselves with any kind of creeping thing that moves on the earth .
for I am Yahweh who brought you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God . you shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' If a woman conceives , and bears a male child , then she shall be unclean seven days ; as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean .
in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised .
she shall continue in the blood of purification thirty @-@ three days . she shall not touch any holy thing , nor come into the sanctuary , until the days of her purifying are completed .
but if she bears a female child , then she shall be unclean two weeks , as in her period ; and she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty @-@ six days .
and he shall offer it before Yahweh , and make Atonement for her ; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood . " ' this is the law for her who bears , whether a male or a female .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
" when a man shall have a rising in his body 's skin , or a scab , or a bright spot , and it becomes in the skin of his body the plague of leprosy , then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest , or to one of his sons , the priests :
and the priest shall examine the plague in the skin of the body : and if the hair in the plague has turned white , and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the body 's skin , it is the plague of leprosy ; and the priest shall examine him , and pronounce him unclean .
if the bright spot is white in the skin of his body , and its appearance isn 't deeper than the skin , and its hair hasn 't turned white , then the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days .
the priest shall examine him on the seventh day , and , behold , if in his eyes the plague is arrested , and the plague hasn 't spread in the skin , then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days .
the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day ; and behold , if the plague has faded , and the plague hasn 't spread in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him clean . it is a scab . he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
but if the scab spreads on the skin , after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing , he shall show himself to the priest again .
the priest shall examine him ; and behold , if the scab has spread on the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean . it is leprosy .
" when the plague of leprosy is in a man , then he shall be brought to the priest ;
and the priest shall examine him . behold , if there is a white rising in the skin , and it has turned the hair white , and there is raw flesh in the rising ,
it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body , and the priest shall pronounce him unclean . he shall not isolate him , for he is unclean .
" if the leprosy breaks out all over the skin , and the leprosy covers all the skin of the infected person from his head even to his feet , as far as it appears to the priest ;
then the priest shall examine him ; and , behold , if the leprosy has covered all his flesh , he shall pronounce him clean of the plague . it has all turned white : he is clean .
but whenever raw flesh appears in him , he shall be unclean .
the priest shall examine the raw flesh , and pronounce him unclean : the raw flesh is unclean . it is leprosy .
or if the raw flesh turns again , and is changed to white , then he shall come to the priest ;
and the priest shall examine him ; and , behold , if the plague has turned white , then the priest shall pronounce him clean of the plague . he is clean .
" when the body has a boil on its skin , and it has healed ,
and in the place of the boil there is a white rising , or a bright spot , reddish @-@ white , then it shall be shown to the priest ;
and the priest shall examine it ; and behold , if its appearance is lower than the skin , and its hair has turned white , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean . it is the plague of leprosy . it has broken out in the boil .
but if the priest examines it , and behold , there are no white hairs in it , and it isn 't deeper than the skin , but is dim , then the priest shall isolate him seven days .
if it spreads in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean . it is a plague .
but if the bright spot stays in its place , and hasn 't spread , it is the SCAR from the boil ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
" or when the body has a burn from fire on its skin , and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot , reddish @-@ white , or white ,
then the priest shall examine it ; and behold , if the hair in the bright spot has turned white , and its appearance is deeper than the skin ; it is leprosy . it has broken out in the burning , and the priest shall pronounce him unclean . it is the plague of leprosy .
but if the priest examines it , and behold , there is no white hair in the bright spot , and it isn 't lower than the skin , but is faded ; then the priest shall isolate him seven days .
the priest shall examine him on the seventh day . if it has spread in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean . it is the plague of leprosy .
if the bright spot stays in its place , and hasn 't spread in the skin , but is faded , it is the swelling from the burn , and the priest shall pronounce him clean ; for it is the SCAR from the burn .
" when a man or woman has a plague on the head or on the beard ,
if the priest examines the plague of itching , and behold , its appearance isn 't deeper than the skin , and there is no black hair in it , then the priest shall isolate him the person infected with itching seven days .
on the seventh day the priest shall examine the plague ; and behold , if the itch hasn 't spread , and there is no yellow hair in it , and the appearance of the itch isn 't deeper than the skin ,
then he shall be shaved , but he shall not shave the itch ; and the priest shall shut him up who has the itch seven more days .
on the seventh day , the priest shall examine the itch ; and behold , if the itch hasn 't spread in the skin , and its appearance isn 't deeper than the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him clean . he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
but if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing ,
then the priest shall examine him ; and behold , if the itch has spread in the skin , the priest shall not look for the yellow hair ; he is unclean .
but if in his eyes the itch is arrested , and black hair has grown in it ; the itch is healed , he is clean . the priest shall pronounce him clean .
" when a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of the body , even white bright spots ;
then the priest shall examine them ; and behold , if the bright spots on the skin of their body are a dull white , it is a harmless rash , it has broken out in the skin ; he is clean .
" if a man 's hair has fallen from his head , he is bald . he is clean .
if his hair has fallen off from the front part of his head , he is forehead bald . he is clean .
but if there is in the bald head , or the bald forehead , a reddish @-@ white plague ; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head , or his bald forehead .
then the priest shall examine him ; and , behold , if the rising of the plague is reddish @-@ white in his bald head , or in his bald forehead , like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh ,
he is a leprous man . he is unclean . the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean . his plague is on his head .
" the leper in whom the plague is shall wear torn clothes , and the hair of his head shall hang loose . he shall cover his upper lip , and shall cry , ' Unclean ! Unclean ! '
all the days in which the plague is in him he shall be unclean . he is unclean . he shall dwell alone . outside of the camp shall be his dwelling .
" the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in , whether it is a woolen garment , or a linen garment ;
whether it is in warp , or woof ; of linen , or of wool ; whether in a skin , or in anything made of skin ;
if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment , or in the skin , or in the warp , or in the woof , or in anything made of skin ; it is the plague of leprosy , and shall be shown to the priest .
the priest shall examine the plague , and isolate the plague seven days .
he shall examine the plague on the seventh day . if the plague has spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in the skin , whatever use the skin is used for , the plague is a destructive mildew . it is unclean .
he shall burn the garment , whether the warp or the woof , in wool or in linen , or anything of skin , in which the plague is : for it is a destructive mildew . it shall be burned in the fire .
" if the priest examines it , and behold , the plague hasn 't spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in anything of skin ;
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which the plague is , and he shall isolate it seven more days .
if the priest looks , and behold , the plague has faded after it is washed , then he shall tear it out of the garment , or out of the skin , or out of the warp , or out of the woof :
and if it appears again in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in anything of skin , it is spreading . you shall burn with fire that in which the plague is .
the garment , either the warp , or the woof , or whatever thing of skin it is , which you shall wash , if the plague has departed from them , then it shall be washed the second time , and it will be clean . "
this is the law of the plague of mildew in a garment of wool or linen , either in the warp , or the woof , or in anything of skin , to pronounce it clean , or to pronounce it unclean .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" this shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing . he shall be brought to the priest ,
and the priest shall go forth out of the camp . the priest shall examine him , and behold , if the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper ,
then the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop .
the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water .
as for the living bird , he shall take it , and the cedar wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water .
he shall sprinkle on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird go into the open field .
" he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes , and shave off all his hair , and bathe himself in water ; and he shall be clean . after that he shall come into the camp , but shall dwell outside his tent seven days .
it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall shave off . he shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his body in water , then he shall be clean .
" on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish , and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish , and three tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mingled with oil , and one log of oil .
the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed , and those things , before Yahweh , at the door of the tent of Meeting .
" the priest shall take one of the male lambs , and offer him for a trespass offering , with the log of oil , and wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh .
he shall kill the male lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering , in the place of the sanctuary ; for as the sin offering is the priest 's , so is the trespass offering . it is most holy .
the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering , and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed , and on the thumb of his right hand , and on the big toe of his right foot .
the priest shall take some of the log of oil , and pour it into the palm of his own left hand .
the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before Yahweh .
the priest shall put some of the rest of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed , and on the thumb of his right hand , and on the big toe of his right foot , upon the blood of the trespass offering .
the rest of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed , and the priest shall make Atonement for him before Yahweh .
" the priest shall offer the sin offering , and make Atonement for him who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness : and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering ;
and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meal offering on the altar . the priest shall make Atonement for him , and he shall be clean .
" if he is poor , and can 't afford so much , then he shall take one male lamb for a trespass offering to be waved , to make Atonement for him , and one tenth of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering , and a log of oil ;
and two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , such as he is able to afford ; and the one shall be a sin offering , and the other a burnt offering .
" on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest , to the door of the tent of Meeting , before Yahweh .
the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering , and the log of oil , and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh .
he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering . the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed , and on the thumb of his right hand , and on the big toe of his right foot .
the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand ;
and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Yahweh .
then the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed , and on the thumb of his right hand , and on the big toe of his right foot , on the place of the blood of the trespass offering .
the rest of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed , to make Atonement for him before Yahweh .
this is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy , who is not able to afford the sacrifice for his cleansing .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
" when you have come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put a spreading mildew in a house in the land of your possession ,
then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , ' There seems to me to be some sort of plague in the house . '
the priest shall command that they empty the house , before the priest goes in to examine the plague , that all that is in the house not be made unclean : and afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house .
he shall examine the plague ; and behold , if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks , greenish or reddish , and it appears to be deeper than the wall ;
then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house , and shut up the house seven days .
the priest shall come again on the seventh day , and look . if the plague has spread in the walls of the house ,
then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague , and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city :
and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over , and they shall pour out the mortar , that they scraped off , outside of the city into an unclean place .
they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other mortar , and shall plaster the house .
" if the plague comes again , and breaks out in the house , after he has taken out the stones , and after he has scraped the house , and after it was plastered ;
then the priest shall come in and look ; and behold , if the plague has spread in the house , it is a destructive mildew in the house . it is unclean .
he shall break down the house , its stones , and its timber , and all the house 's mortar . he shall carry them out of the city into an unclean place .
" moreover he who goes into the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening .
he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes ; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes .
" if the priest shall come in , and examine it , and behold , the plague hasn 't spread in the house , after the house was plastered , then the priest shall pronounce the house clean , because the plague is healed .
to cleanse the house he shall take two birds , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop .
he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water .
he shall take the cedar wood , and the hyssop , and the scarlet , and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the slain bird , and in the running water , and sprinkle the house seven times .

this is the law for any plague of leprosy , and for an itch ,
to teach when it is unclean , and when it is clean . this is the law of leprosy .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When any man has a discharge from his body , because of his discharge he is unclean .

" ' when he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge , then he shall count to himself seven days for his cleansing , and wash his clothes ; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water , and shall be clean .
" ' on the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , and come before Yahweh to the door of the tent of Meeting , and give them to the priest :

" Herewith shall Aaron come into the sanctuary : with a young bull for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering .

" Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering , which is for himself , and shall make Atonement for himself and for his house , and shall kill the bull of the sin offering which is for himself .
he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Yahweh , and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small , and bring it within the veil :
and he shall put the incense on the fire before Yahweh , that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the testimony , so that he will not die .
he shall take some of the blood of the bull , and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east ; and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times .
" then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering , that is for the people , and bring his blood within the veil , and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bull , and sprinkle it on the mercy seat , and before the mercy seat :

" when he has made an end of atoning for the Holy Place , the tent of Meeting , and the altar , he shall present the live goat .
the goat shall carry all their iniquities on himself to a solitary land , and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness .
" Aaron shall come into the tent of Meeting , and shall take off the linen garments , which he put on when he went into the Holy Place , and shall leave them there .

" this shall be an everlasting statute for you , to make Atonement for the children of Israel once in the year because of all their sins . " it was done as Yahweh commanded Moses .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to Aaron , and to his sons , and to all the children of Israel , and say to them : ' this is the thing which Yahweh has commanded ,

and hasn 't brought it to the door of the tent of Meeting , to offer it as an offering to Yahweh before the tabernacle of Yahweh : blood shall be imputed to that man . he has shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people .
this is to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices , which they sacrifice in the open field , that they may bring them to Yahweh , to the door of the tent of Meeting , to the priest , and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace offerings to Yahweh .
the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of Yahweh at the door of the tent of Meeting , and burn the fat for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh .
they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat idols , after which they play the prostitute . this shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations . '
" you shall say to them , ' Any man there is of the house of Israel , or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them , who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice ,
and doesn 't bring it to the door of the tent of Meeting , to sacrifice it to Yahweh ; that man shall be cut off from his people .
" ' any man of the house of Israel , or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them , who eats any kind of blood , I will set my face against that soul who eats blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
for the life of the flesh is in the blood ; and I have given it to you on the altar to make Atonement for your souls : for it is the blood that makes Atonement by reason of the life .
therefore I have said to the children of Israel , " No person among you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger who lives as a foreigner among you eat blood . "
" ' whatever man there is of the children of Israel , or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them , who takes in hunting any animal or bird that may be eaten ; he shall pour out its blood , and cover it with dust .

Yahweh said to Moses ,

Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" say to Aaron , ' None of your seed throughout their generations who has a blemish , may approach to offer the bread of his God .

or a man who has an injured foot , or an injured hand ,
or hunchbacked , or a dwarf , or one who has a defect in his eye , or an itching disease , or scabs , or who has damaged testicles ;
no man of the seed of Aaron the priest who has a blemish , shall come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire . since he has a blemish , he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God .
he shall eat the bread of his God , both of the most holy , and of the holy .
he shall not come near to the veil , nor come near to the altar , because he has a blemish ; that he may not profane my sanctuaries , for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them . ' "
so Moses spoke to Aaron , and to his sons , and to all the children of Israel .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" tell Aaron and his sons to separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , which they make holy to me , and that they not profane my holy name . I am Yahweh .
" tell them , ' If anyone of all your seed throughout your generations approaches the holy things , which the children of Israel make holy to Yahweh , having his uncleanness on him , that soul shall be cut off from before me . I am Yahweh .
or whoever touches any creeping thing , whereby he may be made unclean , or a man of whom he may take uncleanness , whatever uncleanness he has ;
the person that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he bathe his body in water .
when the sun is down , he shall be clean ; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things , because it is his bread .
that which dies of itself , or is torn by animals , he shall not eat , defiling himself by it . I am Yahweh .
" ' they shall therefore follow my requirements , lest they bear sin for it , and die therein , if they profane it . I am Yahweh who sanctifies them .
" ' no stranger shall eat of the holy thing : a foreigner living with the priests , or a hired servant , shall not eat of the holy thing .
but if a priest buys a slave , purchased by his money , he shall eat of it ; and such as are born in his house , they shall eat of his bread .
if a priest 's daughter is married to an outsider , she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things .
" ' if a man eats something holy unwittingly , then he shall add the fifth part of its value to it , and shall give the holy thing to the priest .
the priests shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel , which they offer to Yahweh ,
and so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt , when they eat their holy things : for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
that you may be accepted , you shall offer a male without blemish , of the bulls , of the sheep , or of the goats .
but whatever has a blemish , that you shall not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
blind , injured , maimed , having a wart , festering , or having a running sore , you shall not offer these to Yahweh , nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to Yahweh .
either a bull or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking in his parts , that you may offer for a freewill offering ; but for a vow it shall not be accepted .
that which has its testicles bruised , crushed , broken , or cut , you shall not offer to Yahweh ; neither shall you do thus in your land .
neither shall you offer the bread of your God from the hand of a foreigner of any of these ; because their corruption is in them . there is a blemish in them . they shall not be accepted for you . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" when a bull , or a sheep , or a goat , is born , then it shall remain seven days with its mother ; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the offering of an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
whether it is a cow or ewe , you shall not kill it and its young both in one day .
" when you sacrifice a sacrifice of Thanksgiving to Yahweh , you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted .
it shall be eaten on the same day ; you shall leave none of it until the morning . I am Yahweh .
" therefore you shall keep my commandments , and do them . I am Yahweh .
you shall not profane my holy name , but I will be made holy among the children of Israel . I am Yahweh who makes you holy ,
who brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God . I am Yahweh . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' The set feasts of Yahweh , which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations , even these are my set feasts .
" ' six days shall work be done : but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest , a holy convocation ; you shall do no kind of work . it is a Sabbath to Yahweh in all your dwellings .
" ' these are the set feasts of Yahweh , even holy convocations , which you shall proclaim in their appointed season .

in the first day you shall have a holy convocation . you shall do no regular work .
but you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh seven days . in the seventh day is a holy convocation : you shall do no regular work . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you have come into the land which I give to you , and shall reap its the harvest , then you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest :
and he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh , to be accepted for you . on the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it .
on the day when you wave the sheaf , you shall offer a male lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
you shall eat neither bread , nor roasted grain , nor fresh grain , until this same day , until you have brought the offering of your God . this is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
" ' you shall count from the next day after the Sabbath , from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering ; seven Sabbaths shall be completed :
even to the next day after the seventh Sabbath you shall number fifty days ; and you shall offer a new meal offering to Yahweh .
you shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for a wave offering made of two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour . they shall be baked with yeast , for first fruits to Yahweh .
you shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old , one young bull , and two rams . they shall be a burnt offering to Yahweh , with their meal offering , and their drink offerings , even an offering made by fire , of a sweet aroma to Yahweh .
you shall offer one male goat for a sin offering , and two male lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings .
the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before Yahweh , with the two lambs . they shall be holy to Yahweh for the priest .
you shall make proclamation on the same day : there shall be a holy convocation to you ; you shall do no regular work . this is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations .
" ' when you reap the harvest of your land , you shall not wholly reap into the corners of your field , neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest : you shall leave them for the poor , and for the foreigner . I am Yahweh your God . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' In the seventh month , on the first day of the month , shall be a solemn rest to you , a memorial of blowing of trumpets , a holy convocation .
you shall do no regular work ; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" however on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of Atonement : it shall be a holy convocation to you , and you shall afflict yourselves ; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
you shall do no kind of work in that same day ; for it is a day of Atonement , to make Atonement for you before Yahweh your God .
for whoever it is who shall not deny himself in that same day ; shall be cut off from his people .
whoever it is who does any kind of work in that same day , that person I will destroy from among his people .
you shall do no kind of work : it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
it shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you , and you shall deny yourselves . in the ninth day of the month at evening , from evening to evening , you shall keep your Sabbath . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and say , ' On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tents for seven days to Yahweh .
on the first day shall be a holy convocation : you shall do no regular work .
seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh . on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you ; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh . it is a solemn assembly ; you shall do no regular work .
besides the Sabbaths of Yahweh , and besides your gifts , and besides all your vows , and besides all your freewill offerings , which you give to Yahweh .
" ' so on the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when you have gathered in the fruits of the land , you shall keep the feast of Yahweh seven days : on the first day shall be a solemn rest , and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest .
you shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees , branches of palm trees , and boughs of thick trees , and willows of the Brook ; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God seven days .
you shall keep it a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year : it is a statute forever throughout your generations ; you shall keep it in the seventh month .
you shall dwell in booths seven days . all who are native @-@ born in Israel shall dwell in booths ,
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt . I am Yahweh your God . ' "
Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed feasts of Yahweh .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" command the children of Israel , that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light , to cause a lamp to burn continually .
outside of the veil of the testimony , in the tent of Meeting , shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually : it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations .
he shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before Yahweh continually .
" you shall take fine flour , and bake twelve cakes of it : two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake .
you shall set them in two rows , six on a row , on the pure gold table before Yahweh .
you shall put pure frankincense on each row , that it may be to the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually . it is on the behalf of the children of Israel an everlasting Covenant .
it shall be for Aaron and his sons ; and they shall eat it in a holy place : for it is most holy to him of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute . "
the son of an Israelite woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel ; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp .
the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name , and Cursed ; and they brought him to Moses . his mother 's name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan .
they put him in custody , until the will of Yahweh should be declared to them .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" bring out of the camp him who Cursed ; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head , and let all the Congregation stone him .
you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin .
he who blasphemes the name of Yahweh , he shall surely be put to death ; all the Congregation shall certainly stone him : the foreigner as well as the native @-@ born , when he blasphemes the Name , shall be put to death .
" ' he who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death .
he who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good , life for life .
if anyone injures his neighbor ; as he has done , so shall it be done to him :
Fracture for fracture , eye for eye , tooth for tooth ; as he has injured someone , so shall it be done to him .
he who kills an animal shall make it good ; and he who kills a man shall be put to death .
you shall have one kind of law , for the foreigner as well as the native @-@ born : for I am Yahweh your God . ' "
Yahweh said to Moses in Mount Sinai ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land which I give you , then the land shall keep a Sabbath to Yahweh .
six years you shall sow your field , and six years you shall prune your vineyard , and gather in its fruits ;
but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land , a Sabbath to Yahweh . you shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard .
what grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap , and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather . it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land .
the Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you ; for yourself , for your servant , for your maid , for your hired servant , and for your stranger , who lives as a foreigner with you .
for your livestock also , and for the animals that are in your land , shall all its increase be for food .
" ' you shall count off seven Sabbaths of years , seven times seven years ; and there shall be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years , even forty @-@ nine years .
then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month . on the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land .
you shall make the fiftieth year holy , and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants . it shall be a jubilee to you ; and each of you shall return to his own property , and each of you shall return to his family .
that fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you . in it you shall not sow , neither reap that which grows of itself , nor gather from the undressed vines .
for it is a jubilee ; it shall be holy to you . you shall eat of its increase out of the field .
" ' in this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his property .
" ' if you sell anything to your neighbor , or buy from your neighbor , you shall not wrong one another .
according to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor . according to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you .
according to the length of the years you shall increase its price , and according to the shortness of the years you shall diminish its price ; for he is selling the number of the crops to you .
you shall not wrong one another ; but you shall fear your God : for I am Yahweh your God .
" ' therefore you shall do my statutes , and keep my ordinances and do them ; and you shall dwell in the land in safety .
the land shall yield its fruit , and you shall eat your fill , and dwell therein in safety .
if you said , " What shall we eat the seventh year ? behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in our increase " ;
then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years .
you shall sow the eighth year , and eat of the fruits , the old store ; until the ninth year , until its fruits come in , you shall eat the old store .
" ' the land shall not be sold in perpetuity , for the land is mine ; for you are strangers and live as foreigners with me .
in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land .
" ' if your brother becomes poor , and sells some of his possessions , then his kinsman who is next to him shall come , and redeem that which his brother has sold .
if a man has no one to redeem it , and he becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it ;
then let him reckon the years since its sale , and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it ; and he shall return to his property .
" ' if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold . for a full year he shall have the right of redemption .
" ' nevertheless the cities of the Levites , the houses in the cities of their possession , the Levites may redeem at any time .
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
" ' if your brother has become poor , and his hand can 't support him among you ; then you shall uphold him . he shall live with you like an alien and a temporary resident .
take no interest from him or profit , but fear your God ; that your brother may live among you .
you shall not lend him your money at interest , nor give him your food for profit .
I am Yahweh your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
" ' if your brother has grown poor among you , and sells himself to you ; you shall not make him to serve as a slave .
as a hired servant , and as a temporary resident , he shall be with you ; he shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee :
then he shall go out from you , he and his children with him , and shall return to his own family , and to the possession of his fathers .
for they are my servants , whom I brought out of the land of Egypt . they shall not be sold as slaves .
you shall not rule over him with harshness , but shall fear your God .
" ' as for your male and your female slaves , whom you may have ; of the nations that are around you , from them you may buy male and female slaves .
moreover of the children of the aliens who live among you , of them you may buy , and of their families who are with you , which they have conceived in your land ; and they will be your property .
you may make them an inheritance for your children after you , to hold for a possession ; of them may you take your slaves forever : but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule , one over another , with harshness .
if there are yet many years , according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
if there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee , then he shall reckon with him ; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption .
as a servant hired year by year shall he be with him : he shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight .
if he isn 't redeemed by these means , then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee , he , and his children with him .
for to me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt . I am Yahweh your God .
" ' you shall make for yourselves no idols , neither shall you raise up an engraved image or a pillar , neither shall you place any figured stone in your land , to bow down to it : for I am Yahweh your God .
" ' you shall keep my Sabbaths , and have reverence for my sanctuary . I am Yahweh .
" ' if you walk in my statutes , and keep my commandments , and do them ;
then I will give you your rains in their season , and the land shall yield its increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
your threshing shall reach to the vintage , and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time ; and you shall eat your bread to the full , and dwell in your land safely .
" ' I will give peace in the land , and you shall lie down , and no one will make you afraid ; and I will remove evil animals out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
you shall chase your enemies , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand ; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
" ' I will have respect for you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , and will establish my Covenant with you .
you shall eat old store long kept , and you shall move out the old because of the new .
I will set my tent among you : and my soul won 't abhor you .
I will walk among you , and will be your God , and you will be my people .
I am Yahweh your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that you should not be their slaves ; and I have broken the bars of your yoke , and made you go upright .
" ' but if you will not listen to me , and will not do all these commandments ;
and if you shall reject my statutes , and if your soul abhors my ordinances , so that you will not do all my commandments , but break my Covenant ;
I will set my face against you , and you will be struck before your enemies . those who hate you will rule over you ; and you will flee when no one pursues you .
" ' if you in spite of these things will not listen to me , then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins .
I will break the pride of your power , and I will make your sky like iron , and your soil like brass ;
and your strength will be spent in vain ; for your land won 't yield its increase , neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit .
" ' if you walk contrary to me , and won 't listen to me , then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins .
I will send the wild animals among you , which will rob you of your children , destroy your livestock , and make you few in number ; and your roads will become desolate .
" ' if by these things you won 't be reformed to me , but will walk contrary to me ;
then I will also walk contrary to you ; and I will strike you , even I , seven times for your sins .
I will bring a sword upon you , that will execute the vengeance of the Covenant ; and you will be gathered together within your cities : and I will send the pestilence among you ; and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
when I break your staff of bread , ten women shall bake your bread in one oven , and they shall deliver your bread again by weight : and you shall eat , and not be satisfied .
" ' if you in spite of this won 't listen to me , but walk contrary to me ;
then I will walk contrary to you in wrath ; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins .
you will eat the flesh of your sons , and you will eat the flesh of your daughters .
I will destroy your high places , and cut down your incense altars , and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols ; and my soul will abhor you .
I will lay your cities waste , and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation , and I will not take delight in the sweet fragrance of your offerings .
I will bring the land into desolation ; and your enemies that dwell therein will be astonished at it .
I will scatter you among the nations , and I will draw out the sword after you : and your land will be a desolation , and your cities shall be a waste .
then the land will enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies ' land . even then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths .
as long as it lies desolate it shall have rest , even the rest which it didn 't have in your sabbaths , when you lived on it .
they will stumble over one another , as it were before the sword , when no one pursues : and you will have no power to stand before your enemies .
you will perish among the nations , and the land of your enemies will eat you up .
those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies ' lands ; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them .
" ' if they confess their iniquity , and the iniquity of their fathers , in their trespass which they trespassed against me , and also that , because they walked contrary to me ,
I also walked contrary to them , and brought them into the land of their enemies : if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled , and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity ;
then I will remember my Covenant with Jacob ; and also my Covenant with Isaac , and also my Covenant with Abraham ; and I will remember the land .
the land also will be left by them , and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them : and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity ; because , even because they rejected my ordinances , and their soul abhorred my statutes .
but I will for their sake remember the Covenant of their ancestors , whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations , that I might be their God . I am Yahweh . ' "
these are the statutes , ordinances and laws , which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and say to them , ' When a man makes a vow , the persons shall be for Yahweh by your valuation .
your valuation shall be of a male from twenty years old even to sixty years old , even your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
if it is a female , then your valuation shall be thirty shekels .
if the person is from five years old even to twenty years old , then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels , and for a female ten shekels .
if the person is from a month old even to five years old , then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver , and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver .
if the person is from sixty years old and upward ; if it is a male , then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels , and for a female ten shekels .
but if he is poorer than your valuation , then he shall be set before the priest , and the priest shall value him ; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him .
" ' if it is an animal , of which men offer an offering to Yahweh , all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy .
if it is any unclean animal , of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh , then he shall set the animal before the priest ;
and the priest shall value it , whether it is good or bad . as you the priest values it , so shall it be .
but if he will indeed redeem it , then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation .
" ' when a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh , then the priest shall evaluate it , whether it is good or bad : as the priest shall evaluate it , so shall it stand .
if he who dedicates it will redeem his house , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it , and it shall be his .
if he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee , according to your valuation it shall stand .
but if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee , then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee ; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation .
if he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it , and it shall remain his .
if he will not redeem the field , or if he has sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more ;
but the field , when it goes out in the Jubilee , shall be holy to Yahweh , as a field devoted ; it shall be owned by the priests .
" ' if he dedicates to Yahweh a field which he has bought , which is not of the field of his possession ,
then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee ; and he shall give your valuation on that day , as a holy thing to Yahweh .
in the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs .
all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary : twenty gerahs to the shekel .
" ' only the firstborn among animals , which is made a firstborn to Yahweh , no man may dedicate it ; whether an ox or sheep , it is Yahweh 's .
" ' no one devoted , who shall be devoted from among men , shall be ransomed ; he shall surely be put to death .
" ' all the tithe of the land , whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees , is Yahweh 's . it is holy to Yahweh .
if a man redeems anything of his tithe , he shall add a fifth part to it .
all the tithe of the herds or the flocks , whatever passes under the rod , the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh .
these are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai .
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the tent of Meeting , on the first day of the second month , in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
with you there shall be a man of every tribe ; everyone head of his fathers ' house .
these are the names of the men who shall stand with you : of Reuben : Elizur the son of Shedeur .
of Judah : Nahshon the son of Amminadab .
of Issachar : Nethanel the son of Zuar .
of Zebulun : Eliab the son of Helon .
of the children of Joseph : of Ephraim : Elishama the son of Ammihud . of Manasseh : Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur .
of Benjamin : Abidan the son of Gideoni .
of Asher : Pagiel the son of Ochran .
of Naphtali : Ahira the son of Enan . "
these are those who were called of the Congregation , the princes of the tribes of their fathers ; they were the heads of the thousands of Israel .
Moses and Aaron took these men who are mentioned by name .
the children of Reuben , Israel 's firstborn , their generations , by their families , by their fathers ' houses , according to the number of the names , one by one , every male from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go out to war ;
those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Reuben , were forty @-@ six thousand five hundred .
of the children of Simeon , their generations , by their families , by their fathers ' houses , those who were numbered of it , according to the number of the names , one by one , every male from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go out to war ;
those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Simeon , were fifty @-@ nine thousand three hundred .
of the children of Gad , their generations , by their families , by their fathers ' houses , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go out to war ;
those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Gad , were forty @-@ five thousand six hundred fifty .
of the children of Judah , their generations , by their families , by their fathers ' houses , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go out to war ;
those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Judah , were sixty @-@ four thousand six hundred .

those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Issachar , were fifty @-@ four thousand four hundred .
of the children of Zebulun , their generations , by their families , by their fathers ' houses , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go out to war ;
those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Zebulun , were fifty @-@ seven thousand four hundred .

those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Ephraim , were forty thousand five hundred .
of the children of Manasseh , their generations , by their families , by their fathers ' houses , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go out to war ;
those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Manasseh , were thirty @-@ two thousand two hundred .

those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Benjamin , were thirty @-@ five thousand four hundred .
of the children of Dan , their generations , by their families , by their fathers ' houses , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go forth to war ;
those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Dan , were sixty @-@ two thousand seven hundred .
of the children of Asher , their generations , by their families , by their fathers ' houses , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go forth to war ;
those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Asher , were forty @-@ one thousand five hundred .

those who were numbered of them , of the tribe of Naphtali , were fifty @-@ three thousand four hundred .
these are those who were numbered , whom Moses and Aaron numbered , and the princes of Israel , being twelve men : they were each one for his fathers ' house .
so all those who were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers ' houses , from twenty years old and upward , all who were able to go out to war in Israel ;
even all those who were numbered were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty .
but the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them .
for Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" only the tribe of Levi you shall not number , neither shall you take a census of them among the children of Israel ;
when the tabernacle is to move , the Levites shall take it down ; and when the tabernacle is to be set up , the Levites shall set it up . the stranger who comes near shall be put to death .
the children of Israel shall pitch their tents , every man by his own camp , and every man by his own standard , according to their divisions .
but the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the testimony , that there may be no wrath on the Congregation of the children of Israel : and the Levites shall be responsible for the Tabernacle of the testimony . "
thus the children of Israel did . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses , so they did .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
those who encamp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah , according to their divisions : and the prince of the children of Judah shall be Nahshon the son of Amminadab .
his division , and those who were numbered of them , were seventy @-@ four thousand six hundred .
those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar : and the prince of the children of Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar .
his division , and those who were numbered of it , were fifty @-@ four thousand four hundred .
the tribe of Zebulun : and the prince of the children of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Helon .
his division , and those who were numbered of it , were fifty @-@ seven thousand four hundred .
all who were numbered of the camp of Judah were one hundred eighty @-@ six thousand four hundred , according to their divisions . they shall set out first .
" on the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their divisions . the prince of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur .
his division , and those who were numbered of it , were forty @-@ six thousand five hundred .
" those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon . the prince of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai .
his division , and those who were numbered of them , were fifty @-@ nine thousand three hundred .
" the tribe of Gad : and the prince of the children of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel .
his division , and those who were numbered of them , were forty @-@ five thousand six hundred fifty .
" all who were numbered of the camp of Reuben were one hundred fifty @-@ one thousand four hundred fifty , according to their armies . they shall set out second .
" then the tent of Meeting shall set out , with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps . as they encamp , so shall they set out , every man in his place , by their standards .
" on the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their divisions : and the prince of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud .
his division , and those who were numbered of them , were forty thousand five hundred .
" next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh : and the prince of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur .
his division , and those who were numbered of them , were thirty @-@ two thousand two hundred .
" the tribe of Benjamin : and the prince of the children of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni .
his army , and those who were numbered of them , were thirty @-@ five thousand four hundred .
" all who were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were one hundred eight thousand one hundred , according to their divisions . they shall set out third .
" on the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan according to their divisions : and the prince of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai .
his division , and those who were numbered of them , were sixty @-@ two thousand seven hundred .
" those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher : and the prince of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ochran .
his division , and those who were numbered of them , were forty @-@ one thousand and five hundred .
" the tribe of Naphtali : and the prince of the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan .
his division , and those who were numbered of them , were fifty @-@ three thousand four hundred .
" all who were numbered of the camp of Dan were one hundred fifty @-@ seven thousand six hundred . they shall set out last by their standards . "
these are those who were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers ' houses . all who were numbered of the camps according to their armies were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty .
but the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
thus the children of Israel did . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses , so they encamped by their standards , and so they set out , everyone by their families , according to their fathers ' houses .
now this is the history of the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Yahweh spoke with Moses in Mount Sinai .
these are the names of the sons of Aaron : Nadab the firstborn , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
these are the names of the sons of Aaron , the priests who were anointed , whom he consecrated to minister in the priest 's office .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" bring the tribe of Levi near , and set them before Aaron the priest , that they may minister to him .
they shall keep his requirements , and the requirements of the whole Congregation before the tent of Meeting , to do the service of the tabernacle .
they shall keep all the furnishings of the tent of Meeting , and the obligations of the children of Israel , to do the service of the tabernacle .
you shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons . they are wholly given to him on the behalf of the children of Israel .
you shall appoint Aaron and his sons , and they shall keep their priesthood . the stranger who comes near shall be put to death . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" behold , I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn who open the womb among the children of Israel ; and the Levites shall be mine :
for all the firstborn are mine . on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I made holy to me all the firstborn in Israel , both man and animal . they shall be mine . I am Yahweh . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , saying ,
" count the children of Levi by their fathers ' houses , by their families . you shall count every male from a month old and upward . "
Moses numbered them according to the word of Yahweh , as he was commanded .
these were the sons of Levi by their names : Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari .
these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families : Libni and Shimei .
the sons of Kohath by their families : Amram , and Izhar , Hebron , and Uzziel .
the sons of Merari by their families : Mahli and Mushi . these are the families of the Levites according to their fathers ' houses .
of Gershon was the family of the Libnites , and the family of the Shimeites : these are the families of the Gershonites .
those who were numbered of them , according to the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , even those who were numbered of them were seven thousand five hundred .

" command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper , and everyone who has an issue , and whoever is unclean by the dead .
both you shall put male and female outside of the camp ; that they not defile their camp , in the midst of which I dwell . "
the children of Israel did so , and put them out outside of the camp ; as Yahweh spoke to Moses , so did the children of Israel .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel : ' when a man or woman commits any sin that men commit , so as to trespass against Yahweh , and that soul is guilty ;
then he shall confess his sin which he has done , and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full , and add to it the fifth part of it , and give it to him in respect of whom he has been guilty .
every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they present to the priest , shall be his .
every man 's holy things shall be his : whatever any man gives the priest , it shall be his . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them : ' if any man 's wife goes astray , and is unfaithful to him ,
and a man lies with her carnally , and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband , and is kept close , and she is defiled , and there is no witness against her , and she isn 't taken in the act ;
and the spirit of jealousy comes on him , and he is Jealous of his wife , and she is defiled : or if the spirit of jealousy comes on him , and he is Jealous of his wife , and she isn 't defiled :
then the man shall bring his wife to the priest , and shall bring her offering for her : the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal . he shall pour no oil on it , nor put frankincense on it , for it is a meal offering of jealousy , a meal offering of memorial , bringing iniquity to memory .
the priest shall bring her near , and set her before Yahweh ;
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel ; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water .
the priest shall set the woman before Yahweh , and let the hair of the woman 's head go loose , and put the meal offering of memorial in her hands , which is the meal offering of jealousy . the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that brings a curse .
but if you have gone astray , being under your husband , and if you are defiled , and some man has lain with you besides your husband : "
and this water that brings a curse will go into your bowels , and make your body swell , and your thigh fall away . " the woman shall say , " Amen , Amen . "
" ' the priest shall write these curses in a book , and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness .
he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse ; and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter .
the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the meal offering before Yahweh , and bring it to the altar .
the priest shall take a handful of the meal offering , as its memorial , and burn it on the altar , and afterward shall make the woman drink the water .
if the woman isn 't defiled , but is clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .
" ' this is the law of jealousy , when a wife , being under her husband , goes astray , and is defiled ;
or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man , and he is Jealous of his wife ; then he shall set the woman before Yahweh , and the priest shall execute on her all this law .
the man shall be free from iniquity , and that woman shall bear her iniquity . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them : ' when either man or woman shall make a special vow , the vow of a Nazirite , to separate himself to Yahweh ,
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink . he shall drink no vinegar of wine , or vinegar of fermented drink , neither shall he drink any juice of grapes , nor eat fresh grapes or dried .
all the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine , from the seeds even to the skins .
" ' all the days of his vow of separation no razor shall come on his head , until the days are fulfilled , in which he separates himself to Yahweh . he shall be holy . he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long .
" ' all the days that he separates himself to Yahweh he shall not go near a dead body .
he shall not make himself unclean for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die ; because his separation to God is on his head .
all the days of his separation he is holy to Yahweh .
" ' if any man dies very suddenly beside him , and he defiles the head of his separation ; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing . on the seventh day he shall shave it .
on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest , to the door of the tent of Meeting .
the priest shall offer one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make Atonement for him , because he sinned by reason of the dead , and shall make his head holy that same day .
he shall separate to Yahweh the days of his separation , and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering ; but the former days shall be void , because his separation was defiled .
" ' this is the law of the Nazirite : when the days of his separation are fulfilled , he shall be brought to the door of the tent of Meeting ,
and he shall offer his offering to Yahweh , one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering , and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering , and one ram without blemish for peace offerings ,
and a basket of unleavened bread , cakes of fine flour mixed with oil , and unleavened wafers anointed with oil , and their meal offering , and their drink offerings .
the priest shall present them before Yahweh , and shall offer his sin offering , and his burnt offering .
he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh , with the basket of unleavened bread . the priest shall offer also its meal offering , and its drink offering .
the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of Meeting , and shall take the hair of the head of his separation , and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings .
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh . this is holy for the priest , together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered . after that the Nazirite may drink wine .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to Aaron and to his sons , saying , ' This is how you shall bless the children of Israel . ' you shall tell them ,
'Yahweh bless you , and keep you .
Yahweh make his face to shine on you , and be gracious to you .
Yahweh lift up his face toward you , and give you peace . '
" so they shall put my name on the children of Israel ; and I will bless them . "

this was the workmanship of the lampstand , beaten work of gold . from its base to its flowers , it was beaten work : according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses , so he made the lampstand .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" take the Levites from among the children of Israel , and cleanse them .
you shall do this to them , to cleanse them : sprinkle the water of cleansing on them , let them shave their whole bodies with a razor , and let them wash their clothes , and cleanse themselves .
then let them take a young bull , and its meal offering , fine flour mixed with oil ; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering .
you shall present the Levites before the tent of Meeting . you shall assemble the whole Congregation of the children of Israel .
you shall present the Levites before Yahweh . the children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites ,
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering , on the behalf of the children of Israel , that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh .
" the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls , and you shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering to Yahweh , to make Atonement for the Levites .
you shall set the Levites before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh .
thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel , and the Levites shall be mine .
" after that , the Levites shall go in to do the service of the tent of Meeting : and you shall cleanse them , and offer them as a wave offering .
for they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel ; instead of all who open the womb , even the firstborn of all the children of Israel , I have taken them to me .
for all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine , both man and animal . on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , I sanctified them for myself .
I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel .
Moses , and Aaron , and all the Congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so the children of Israel did to them .
the Levites purified themselves from sin , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh ; and Aaron made Atonement for them to cleanse them .
after that , the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of Meeting before Aaron , and before his sons : as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so they did to them .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" this is that which belongs to the Levites : from twenty @-@ five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the tent of Meeting ;
and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the work , and shall serve no more ,
but shall minister with their brothers in the tent of Meeting , to perform the duty , and shall do no service . you shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
" moreover let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season .
on the fourteenth day of this month , at evening , you shall keep it in its appointed season--according to all its statutes , and according to all its ordinances , you shall keep it . "
Moses spoke to the children of Israel , that they should keep the Passover .
they kept the Passover in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month , at evening , in the wilderness of Sinai . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did .
there were certain men , who were unclean because of the dead body of a man , so that they could not keep the Passover on that day , and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day .
those men said to him , " We are unclean because of the dead body of a man . why are we kept back , that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among the children of Israel ? "
Moses answered them , " wait , that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning you . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" say to the children of Israel , ' If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body , or is on a journey far away , he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh .
in the second month , on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it ; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
they shall leave none of it until the morning , nor break a bone of it . according to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it .
but the man who is clean , and is not on a journey , and fails to keep the Passover , that soul shall be cut off from his people . because he didn 't offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
on the day that the tabernacle was raised up , the cloud covered the tabernacle , even the tent of the testimony : and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire , until morning .
so it was continually . the cloud covered it , and the appearance of fire by night .
whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent , then after that the children of Israel traveled ; and in the place where the cloud remained , there the children of Israel encamped .
at the commandment of Yahweh , the children of Israel traveled , and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped . as long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped .
when the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days , then the children of Israel kept Yahweh 's command , and didn 't travel .
sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle ; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped , and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled .
sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning ; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning , they traveled : or by day and by night , when the cloud was taken up , they traveled .
at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped , and at the commandment of Yahweh they traveled . they kept Yahweh 's command , at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" make two trumpets of silver . you shall make them of beaten work . you shall use them for the calling of the Congregation , and for the journeying of the camps .
when they blow them , all the Congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the tent of Meeting .
if they blow just one , then the princes , the heads of the thousands of Israel , shall gather themselves to you .
when you blow an alarm , the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward .
when you blow an alarm the second time , the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward . they shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
but when the assembly is to be gathered together , you shall blow , but you shall not sound an alarm .
" the sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow the trumpets . this shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations .
when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you , then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets . then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God , and you will be saved from your enemies .
it happened in the second year , in the second month , on the twentieth day of the month , that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony .
the children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran .
they first went forward according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses .

Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin .
the standard of the camp of the children of Dan , which was the rear guard of all the camps , set forward according to their armies . Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army .
Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher .
Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali .
thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies ; and they went forward .
he said to him , " I will not go ; but I will depart to my own land , and to my relatives . "
he said , " Don 't leave us , please ; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness , and you can be our eyes .
it shall be , if you go with us , yes , it shall be , that whatever good Yahweh does to us , we will do the same to you . "
they set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days ' journey . the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh went before them three days ' journey , to seek out a resting place for them .
the cloud of Yahweh was over them by day , when they set forward from the camp .
it happened , when the Ark went forward , that Moses said , " Rise up , Yahweh , and let your enemies be scattered ! let those who hate you flee before you ! "
when it rested , he said , " Return , Yahweh , to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel . "
the people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh . when Yahweh heard it , his anger was kindled ; and Yahweh 's fire burnt among them , and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp .
the people cried to Moses ; and Moses prayed to Yahweh , and the fire abated .
the name of that place was called Taberah , because Yahweh 's fire burnt among them .
the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly : and the children of Israel also wept again , and said , " Who will give us flesh to eat ?
we remember the fish , which we ate in Egypt for nothing ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlic ;
but now we have lost our appetite . there is nothing at all except this manna to look at . "
the manna was like coriander seed , and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium .
the people went around , gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in mortars , and boiled it in pots , and made cakes of it . its taste was like the taste of fresh oil .
when the dew fell on the camp in the night , the manna fell on it .
Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families , every man at the door of his tent ; and the anger of Yahweh was kindled greatly ; and Moses was displeased .
Moses said to Yahweh , " Why have you treated with your servant so badly ? why haven 't I found favor in your sight , that you lay the burden of all this people on me ?
where could I get meat to give to all this people ? for they weep to me , saying , ' Give us meat , that we may eat . '
I am not able to bear all this people alone , because it is too heavy for me .
if you treat me this way , please kill me right now , if I have found favor in your sight ; and don 't let me see my wretchedness . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom you know to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them to the tent of Meeting , that they may stand there with you .
I will come down and talk with you there . I will take of the Spirit which is on you , and will put it on them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you , that you not bear it yourself alone .
you will not eat one day , nor two days , nor five days , neither ten days , nor twenty days ,
but a whole month , until it come out at your nostrils , and it is loathsome to you ; because that you have rejected Yahweh who is among you , and have wept before him , saying , " Why did we come out of Egypt ? " ' "
shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them , to be sufficient for them ? shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to be sufficient for them ? "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Has Yahweh 's hand grown short ? now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not . "
Moses went out , and told the people the words of Yahweh ; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people , and set them around the tent .
Yahweh came down in the cloud , and spoke to him , and took of the Spirit that was on him , and put it on the seventy elders : and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them , they prophesied , but they did so no more .
but two men remained in the camp . the name of one was Eldad , and the name of the other Medad : and the Spirit rested on them ; and they were of those who were written , but had not gone out to the tent ; and they prophesied in the camp .
a young man ran , and told Moses , and said , " Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp ! "
Joshua the son of nun , the servant of Moses , one of his chosen men , answered , " My lord Moses , forbid them ! "
Moses said to him , " Are you Jealous for my sake ? I wish that all Yahweh 's people were prophets , that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them ! "
Moses went into the camp , he and the elders of Israel .
a wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , about a day 's journey on this side , and a day 's journey on the other side , around the camp , and about two cubits above the surface of the earth .
the people rose up all that day , and all the night , and all the next day , and gathered the quails . he who gathered least gathered ten homers ; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp .
while the flesh was yet between their teeth , before it was chewed , the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people , and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague .
the name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah , because there they buried the people who lusted .
Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married ; for he had married a Cushite woman .
they said , " Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses ? Hasn 't he spoken also with us ? " and Yahweh heard it .
now the man Moses was very humble , above all the men who were on the surface of the earth .
Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses , to Aaron , and to Miriam , " You three come out to the tent of Meeting ! " the three of them came out .
Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud , and stood at the door of the tent , and called Aaron and Miriam ; and they both came forward .
he said , " Hear now my words . if there is a prophet among you , I Yahweh will make myself known to him in a vision . I will speak with him in a dream .
my servant Moses is not so . he is faithful in all my house .
with him I will speak mouth to mouth , even plainly , and not in riddles ; and he shall see Yahweh 's form . why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant , against Moses ? "
the cloud departed from over the tent ; and behold , Miriam was leprous , as white as snow . Aaron looked at Miriam , and behold , she was leprous .
Aaron said to Moses , " Oh , my lord , please don 't count this sin against us , in which we have done foolishly , and in which we have sinned .
let her not , I pray , be as one dead , of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother 's womb . "
Moses cried to Yahweh , saying , " heal her , God , I beg you ! "
Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days , and the people didn 't travel until Miriam was brought in again .
afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth , and encamped in the wilderness of Paran .
Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Yahweh : all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel .
these were their names : of the tribe of Reuben , Shammua the son of Zaccur .
of the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat the son of Hori .
of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
of the tribe of Ephraim , Hoshea the son of nun .
of the tribe of Benjamin , Palti the son of Raphu .
of the tribe of Joseph , of the tribe of Manasseh , Gaddi the son of Susi .
of the tribe of Asher , Sethur the son of Michael .
of the tribe of Naphtali , Nahbi the son of Vophsi .
of the tribe of Gad , Geuel the son of Machi .
these are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land . Moses called Hoshea the son of nun Joshua .
Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said to them , " Go up this way by the South , and go up into the hill country :
and see the land , what it is ; and the people who dwell therein , whether they are strong or weak , whether they are few or many ;
and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it is good or bad ; and what cities they are that they dwell in , whether in camps , or in strongholds ;
so they went up , and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob , to the entrance of Hamath .
they went up by the South , and came to Hebron ; and Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were there . ( now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
they came to the valley of Eshcol , and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bore it on a staff between two . they also brought some of the pomegranates and figs .
that place was called the valley of Eshcol , because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there .
they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days .
they went and came to Moses , and to Aaron , and to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , to the wilderness of Paran , to Kadesh ; and brought back word to them , and to all the Congregation , and showed them the fruit of the land .
they told him , and said , " We came to the land where you sent us ; and surely it flows with milk and honey ; and this is its fruit .
however the people who dwell in the land are strong , and the cities are fortified and very large . moreover , we saw the children of Anak there .
Amalek dwells in the land of the South : and the Hittite , and the Jebusite , and the Amorite , dwell in the hill country ; and the Canaanite dwells by the sea , and along by the side of the Jordan . "
Caleb stilled the people before Moses , and said , " Let us go up at once , and possess it ; for we are well able to overcome it . "
but the men who went up with him said , " We aren 't able to go up against the people ; for they are stronger than we . "
there we saw the Nephilim , the sons of Anak , who come of the Nephilim : and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers , and so we were in their sight . "
all the Congregation lifted up their voice , and cried ; and the people wept that night .
all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole Congregation said to them , " Would that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would that we had died in this wilderness !
why does Yahweh bring us to this land , to fall by the sword ? our wives and our little ones will be a prey : wouldn 't it be better for us to return into Egypt ? "
they said one to another , " Let us make a captain , and let us return into Egypt . "
then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the Congregation of the children of Israel .
Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , who were of those who spied out the land , tore their clothes :
and they spoke to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , saying , " The land , which we passed through to spy it out , is an exceeding good land .
if Yahweh delights in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it to us ; a land which flows with milk and honey .
only don 't rebel against Yahweh , neither fear the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defense is removed from over them , and Yahweh is with us . Don 't fear them . "
but all the Congregation threatened to stone them with stones . the glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel .
Yahweh said to Moses , " How long will this people despise me ? and how long will they not believe in me , for all the signs which I have worked among them ?
I will strike them with the pestilence , and disinherit them , and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they . "
Moses said to Yahweh , " Then the Egyptians will hear it ; for you brought up this people in your might from among them ;
now please let the power of the Lord be great , according as you have spoken , saying ,
'Yahweh is slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness , forgiving iniquity and disobedience ; and that will by no means clear the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , on the third and on the fourth generation . '
please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness , and according as you have forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now . "
Yahweh said , " I have pardoned according to your word :
but in very deed , as I live , and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Yahweh ;
because all those men who have seen my glory , and my signs , which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness , yet have tempted me these ten times , and have not listened to my voice ;
surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers , neither shall any of those who despised me see it :
but my servant Caleb , because he had another spirit with him , and has followed me fully , him will I bring into the land into which he went ; and his seed shall possess it .
now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley : tomorrow turn , and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea . "
tell them , ' As I live , says Yahweh , surely as you have spoken in my ears , so will I do to you :
your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness ; and all who were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , who have murmured against me ,
surely you shall not come into the land , concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein , except Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of nun .
but your little ones , that you said should be a prey , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which you have rejected .
but as for you , your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness .
your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years , and shall bear your prostitution , until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness .
after the number of the days in which you spied out the land , even forty days , for every day a year , you will bear your iniquities , even forty years , and you will know my alienation . '
I , Yahweh , have spoken , surely this will I do to all this evil Congregation , who are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die . "
the men , whom Moses sent to spy out the land , who returned , and made all the Congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up an evil report against the land ,
even those men who brought up an evil report of the land , died by the plague before Yahweh .
but Joshua the son of nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land .
Moses told these words to all the children of Israel : and the people mourned greatly .
they rose up early in the morning , and went up to the top of the mountain , saying , " behold , we are here , and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised : for we have sinned . "
Moses said , " Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh , since it shall not prosper ?
Don 't go up , for Yahweh isn 't among you ; that you not be struck down before your enemies .
for there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you , and you shall fall by the sword : because you are turned back from following Yahweh , therefore Yahweh will not be with you . "
but they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain : nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and Moses , didn 't depart out of the camp .
then the Amalekite came down , and the Canaanite who lived in that mountain , and struck them and beat them down , even to Hormah .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you have come into the land of your habitations , which I give to you ,
and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice , to accomplish a vow , or as a freewill offering , or in your set feasts , to make a pleasant aroma to Yahweh , of the herd , or of the flock ;
then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of oil :
and wine for the drink offering , the fourth part of a hin , you shall prepare with the burnt offering , or for the sacrifice , for each lamb .
" ' or for a ram , you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil :
and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh .
when you prepare a bull for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice , to accomplish a vow , or for peace offerings to Yahweh ;
then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil :
and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine , for an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh .
thus shall it be done for each bull , or for each ram , or for each of the male lambs , or of the young goats .
according to the number that you shall prepare , so you shall do to everyone according to their number .
" ' all who are native @-@ born shall do these things in this way , in offering an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh .
if a stranger lives as a foreigner with you , or whoever may be among you throughout your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh ; as you do , so he shall do .
one law and one ordinance shall be for you , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land where I bring you ,
then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land , you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh .
of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering : as the wave offering of the threshing floor , so you shall heave it .
of the first of your dough you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout your generations .
then it shall be , if it be done unwittingly , without the knowledge of the Congregation , that all the Congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering , for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh , with the meal offering of it , and the drink offering of it , according to the ordinance , and one male goat for a sin offering .
the priest shall make Atonement for all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and they shall be forgiven ; for it was an error , and they have brought their offering , an offering made by fire to Yahweh , and their sin offering before Yahweh , for their error :
and all the Congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven , and the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them ; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly .
" ' if one person sins unwittingly , then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering .
the priest shall make Atonement for the soul who errs , when he sins unwittingly , before Yahweh , to make Atonement for him ; and he shall be forgiven .
you shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly , for him who is native @-@ born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them .
" ' but the soul who does anything with a high hand , whether he is native @-@ born or a foreigner , the same blasphemes Yahweh ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
because he has despised the word of Yahweh , and has broken his commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off ; his iniquity shall be on him . ' "
while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day .
those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron , and to all the Congregation .
they put him in custody , because it had not been declared what should be done to him .
Yahweh said to Moses , " The man shall surely be put to death : all the Congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp . "
all the Congregation brought him outside of the camp , and stoned him to death with stones ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them that they should make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue :
and it shall be to you for a fringe , that you may look on it , and remember all the commandments of Yahweh , and do them ; and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes , after which you use to play the prostitute ;
that you may remember and do all my commandments , and be holy to your God .
I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am Yahweh your God . "
when Moses heard it , he fell on his face :
and he spoke to Korah and to all his company , saying , " In the morning Yahweh will show who are his , and who is holy , and will cause him to come near to him : even him whom he shall choose he will cause to come near to him .
do this : take censers , Korah , and all his company ;
and put fire in them , and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow : and it shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses , he shall be holy . you have gone too far , you sons of Levi ! "
Moses said to Korah , " Hear now , you sons of Levi !
therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Yahweh : and Aaron , what is he that you murmur against him ? "
Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab ; and they said , " We won 't come up :
is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , but you must also make yourself a prince over us ?
moreover you haven 't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey , nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : will you put out the eyes of these men ? we won 't come up . "
Moses was very angry , and said to Yahweh , " Don 't respect their offering : I have not taken one donkey from them , neither have I hurt one of them . "
Moses said to Korah , " You and all your company go before Yahweh , you , and they , and Aaron , tomorrow :
and each man take his censer , and put incense on them , and each man bring before Yahweh his censer , two hundred fifty censers ; you also , and Aaron , each his censer . "
they each took his censer , and put fire in them , and laid incense thereon , and stood at the door of the tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron .
Korah assembled all the Congregation against them to the door of the tent of Meeting : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the Congregation .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
they fell on their faces , and said , " God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and will you be angry with all the Congregation ? "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram ; and the elders of Israel followed him .
so they went away from the tent of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood at the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little ones .
Moses said , " Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works ; for they are not from my own mind .
if these men die the common death of all men , or if they be visited after the visitation of all men ; then Yahweh hasn 't sent me .
but if Yahweh make a new thing , and the ground open its mouth , and swallow them up , with all that appertain to them , and they go down alive into Sheol ; then you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh . "
it happened , as he made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground split apart that was under them ;
and the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and all the men who appertained to Korah , and all their goods .
so they , and all that appertained to them , went down alive into Sheol : and the earth closed on them , and they perished from among the assembly .
all Israel that were around them fled at their cry ; for they said , " Lest the earth swallow us up ! "
fire came forth from Yahweh , and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , that he take up the censers out of the burning , and scatter the fire yonder ; for they are holy ,
but on the next day all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , " You have killed Yahweh 's people ! "
it happened , when the Congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tent of Meeting : and behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of Yahweh appeared .
Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of Meeting .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Aaron did as Moses said , and ran into the midst of the assembly ; and behold , the plague has begun among the people : and he put on the incense , and made Atonement for the people .
he stood between the dead and the living ; and the plague was stayed .
now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred , besides those who died about the matter of Korah .
Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of Meeting : and the plague was stayed .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and take of them rods , one for each fathers ' house , of all their princes according to their fathers ' houses , twelve rods : write every man 's name on his rod .
you shall write Aaron 's name on the rod of Levi ; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers ' houses .
you shall lay them up in the tent of Meeting before the testimony , where I meet with you .
it shall happen , that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , which they murmur against you . "
Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and all their princes gave him rods , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony .
it happened on the next day , that Moses went into the tent of the testimony ; and behold , the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded , and put forth buds , and produced blossoms , and bore ripe almonds .
Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel : and they looked , and took every man his rod .
Moses did so . as Yahweh commanded him , so he did .
the children of Israel spoke to Moses , saying , " behold , we perish ! we are undone ! we are all undone !
everyone who comes near , who comes near to the tabernacle of Yahweh , dies ! will we all perish ? "
they shall keep your commands , and the duty of all the tent : only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar , that they not die , neither they , nor you .
they shall be joined to you , and keep the responsibility of the tent of Meeting , for all the service of the tent : and a stranger shall not come near to you .
" you shall perform the duty of the sanctuary , and the duty of the altar ; that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel .
I , behold , I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are a gift , given to Yahweh , to do the service of the tent of Meeting .
Yahweh spoke to Aaron , " I , behold , I have given you the command of my wave offerings , even all the holy things of the children of Israel ; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing , and to your sons , as a portion forever .
this shall be yours of the most holy things from the fire : every offering of theirs , even every meal offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs , which they shall render to me , shall be most holy for you and for your sons .
you shall eat of it like the most holy things . every male shall eat of it . it shall be holy to you .
" all the best of the oil , and all the best of the vintage , and of the grain , the first fruits of them which they give to Yahweh , to you have I given them .
the first @-@ ripe fruits of all that is in their land , which they bring to Yahweh , shall be yours ; everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it .
" everything devoted in Israel shall be yours .
you shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old , according to your estimation , for five shekels of money , after the shekel of the sanctuary ( the same is twenty gerahs ) .
their flesh shall be yours , as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh , it shall be yours .
Yahweh said to Aaron , " You shall have no inheritance in their land , neither shall you have any portion among them . I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel .
" to the children of Levi , behold , I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance , in return for their service which they serve , even the service of the tent of Meeting .
henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the tent of Meeting , lest they bear sin , and die .
but the Levites shall do the service of the tent of Meeting , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations ; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
for the tithe of the children of Israel , which they offer as a wave offering to Yahweh , I have given to the Levites for an inheritance : therefore I have said to them , ' Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" moreover you shall speak to the Levites , and tell them , ' When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh , a tithe of the tithe .
your wave offering shall be reckoned to you , as though it were the grain of the threshing floor , and as the fullness of the winepress .
thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all your tithes , which you receive of the children of Israel ; and of it you shall give Yahweh 's wave offering to Aaron the priest .
out of all your gifts you shall offer every wave offering of Yahweh , of all its best , even the holy part of it out of it . '
" therefore you shall tell them , ' When you heave its best from it , then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor , and as the increase of the winepress .
you shall eat it in every place , you and your households : for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of Meeting .
you shall bear no sin by reason of it , when you have heaved from it its best : and you shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel , that you not die . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
" this is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded : speak to the children of Israel , that they bring you a red heifer without spot , in which is no blemish , and which was never yoked .
you shall give her to Eleazar the priest , and he shall bring her forth outside of the camp , and one shall kill her before his face :
and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of Meeting seven times .
one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her Dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the evening .
he who burns her shall wash his clothes in water , and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the evening .
he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the evening : and it shall be to the children of Israel , and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them , for a statute forever .
" he who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days :
the same shall purify himself with water on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he doesn 't purify himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
" this is the law when a man dies in a tent : everyone who comes into the tent , and everyone who is in the tent , shall be unclean seven days .
every open vessel , which has no covering bound on it , is unclean .
" whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
" for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering ; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel :
and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify him ; and he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at evening .
but the man who shall be unclean , and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly , because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh : the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him ; he is unclean .
it shall be a perpetual statute to them : and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes , and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening .
" whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean ; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening . "
the children of Israel , even the whole Congregation , came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month : and the people stayed in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
there was no water for the Congregation : and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron .
the people strove with Moses , and spoke , saying , " We wish that we had died when our brothers died before Yahweh !
why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness , that we should die there , we and our animals ?
why have you made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us in to this evil place ? it is no place of seed , or of figs , or of vines , or of pomegranates ; neither is there any water to drink . "
Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of Meeting , and fell on their faces : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them .
Moses took the rod from before Yahweh , as he commanded him .
Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock , and he said to them , " Hear now , you rebels ; shall we bring you water out of this rock for you ? "
Moses lifted up his hand , and struck the rock with his rod twice : and water came forth abundantly , and the Congregation drank , and their livestock .
Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron , " Because you didn 't believe in me , to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them . "
these are the waters of Meribah ; because the children of Israel strove with Yahweh , and he was sanctified in them .
Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom , saying : " thus says your brother Israel : you know all the travail that has happened to us :
how our fathers went down into Egypt , and we lived in Egypt a long time ; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us , and our fathers :
and when we cried to Yahweh , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and brought us forth out of Egypt : and behold , we are in Kadesh , a city in the uttermost of your border .
Edom said to him , " You shall not pass through me , lest I come out with the sword against you . "
he said , " You shall not pass through . " Edom came out against him with many people , and with a strong hand .
thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border , so Israel turned away from him .
they traveled from Kadesh : and the children of Israel , even the whole Congregation , came to Mount Hor .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor , by the border of the land of Edom , saying ,
" Aaron shall be gathered to his people ; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel , because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah .
take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up to Mount Hor ;
and strip Aaron of his garments , and put them on Eleazar his son : and Aaron shall be taken , and shall die there . "
Moses did as Yahweh commanded : and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the Congregation .
Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , and put them on Eleazar his son ; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain : and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain .
when all the Congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they wept for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the South , heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim ; and he fought against Israel , and took some of them captive .
Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh , and said , " If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities . "
Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Canaanites ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities : and the name of the place was called Hormah .
they traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea , to compass the land of Edom : and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way .
Yahweh sent fiery Serpents among the people , and they bit the people ; and many people of Israel died .
the people came to Moses , and said , " We have sinned , because we have spoken against Yahweh , and against you . pray to Yahweh , that he take away the Serpents from us . " Moses prayed for the people .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Make a fiery serpent , and set it on a standard : and it shall happen , that everyone who is bitten , when he sees it , shall live . "
Moses made a serpent of brass , and set it on the standard : and it happened , that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he looked to the serpent of brass , he lived .
the children of Israel traveled , and encamped in Oboth .
they traveled from Oboth , and encamped at Iyeabarim , in the wilderness which is before Moab , toward the sunrise .
from there they traveled , and encamped in the valley of Zered .
from there they traveled , and encamped on the other side of the Arnon , which is in the wilderness , that comes out of the border of the Amorites : for the Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Yahweh , " Vaheb in Suphah , the valleys of the Arnon ,
the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar , leans on the border of Moab . "
from there they traveled to Beer : that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses , " Gather the people together , and I will give them water . "
then sang Israel this song : " spring up , well ; sing to it :
the well , which the princes dug , which the nobles of the people dug , with the scepter , and with their poles . " from the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah ;
and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looks down on the desert .
Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , saying ,
" let me pass through your land : we will not turn aside into field , or into vineyard ; we will not drink of the water of the wells : we will go by the king 's highway , until we have passed your border . "
Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness , and came to Jahaz ; and he fought against Israel .
Israel struck him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok , even to the children of Ammon ; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
Israel took all these cities : and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon , and in all its towns .
for Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even to the Arnon .
therefore those who speak in Proverbs say , " Come to Heshbon . let the city of Sihon be built and established ;
for a fire has gone out of Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sihon . it has devoured Ar of Moab , The lords of the high places of the Arnon .
Woe to you , Moab ! you are undone , people of Chemosh ! he has given his sons as fugitives , and his daughters into captivity , to Sihon king of the Amorites .
we have shot at them . Heshbon has perished even to Dibon . we have laid waste even to Nophah , Which reaches to Medeba . "
thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites .
Moses sent to spy out Jazer ; and they took its towns , and drove out the Amorites who were there .
they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
so they struck him , and his sons and all his people , until there was none left him remaining : and they possessed his land .
the children of Israel traveled , and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho .
Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
Moab was very afraid of the people , because they were many : and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came to Balaam , and spoke to him the words of Balak .
he said to them , " Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as Yahweh shall speak to me . " the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam .
God came to Balaam , and said , " Who are these men with you ? "
Balaam said to God , " Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , has said to me ,
'Behold , the people that has come out of Egypt , it covers the surface of the earth : now , come curse me them ; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them , and shall drive them out . ' "
God said to Balaam , " You shall not go with them . you shall not curse the people ; for they are blessed . "
Balaam rose up in the morning , and said to the princes of Balak , " Go to your land ; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you . "
the princes of Moab rose up , and they went to Balak , and said , " Balaam refuses to come with us . "
Balak sent yet again princes , more , and more honorable than they .
they came to Balaam , and said to him , " Thus says Balak the son of Zippor , ' Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me :
for I will promote you to very great honor , and whatever you say to me I will do . please come therefore , and curse this people for me . ' "
Balaam answered the servants of Balak , " If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I can 't go beyond the word of Yahweh my God , to do less or more .
now therefore , please wait also here this night , that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more . "
God came to Balaam at night , and said to him , " If the men have come to call you , rise up , go with them ; but only the word which I speak to you , that you shall do . "
Balaam rose up in the morning , and saddled his donkey , and went with the princes of Moab .
God 's anger was kindled because he went ; and the angel of Yahweh placed himself in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding on his donkey , and his two servants were with him .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and the donkey turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam struck the donkey , to turn her into the way .
then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh , and she thrust herself to the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he struck her again .
the angel of Yahweh went further , and stood in a narrow place , where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh , and she lay down under Balaam : and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he struck the donkey with his staff .
Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey , and she said to Balaam , " What have I done to you , that you have struck me these three times ? "
Balaam said to the donkey , " Because you have mocked me , I wish there were a sword in my hand , for now I would have killed you . "
then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and he bowed his head , and fell on his face .
the angel of Yahweh said to him , " Why have you struck your donkey these three times ? behold , I have come forth as an adversary , because your way is perverse before me :
and the donkey saw me , and turned aside before me these three times . unless she had turned aside from me , surely now I would have killed you , and saved her alive . "
Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh , " I have sinned ; for I didn 't know that you stood in the way against me . now therefore , if it displeases you , I will go back again . "
the angel of Yahweh said to Balaam , " Go with the men ; but only the word that I shall speak to you , that you shall speak . " so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
when Balak heard that Balaam had come , he went out to meet him to the City of Moab , which is on the border of the Arnon , which is in the utmost part of the border .
Balak said to Balaam , " Didn 't I earnestly send to you to call you ? why didn 't you come to me ? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor ? "
Balaam said to Balak , " behold , I have come to you : have I now any power at all to speak anything ? the word that God puts in my mouth , that shall I speak . "
Balaam went with Balak , and they came to Kiriath Huzoth .
Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep , and sent to Balaam , and to the princes who were with him .
it happened in the morning , that Balak took Balaam , and brought him up into the high places of Baal ; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people .
Balaam said to Balak , " Build me here seven altars , and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams . "
Balak did as Balaam had spoken ; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram .
God met Balaam : and he said to him , " I have prepared the seven altars , and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar . "
Yahweh put a word in Balaam 's mouth , and said , " Return to Balak , and thus you shall speak . "
he returned to him , and behold , he was standing by his burnt offering , he , and all the princes of Moab .
how shall I curse whom God has not Cursed ? how shall I defy whom Yahweh has not defied ?
for from the top of the rocks I see him . from the hills I see him . behold , it is a people that dwells alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
who can count the dust of Jacob , or number the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous ! let my last end be like his ! "
Balak said to Balaam , " What have you done to me ? I took you to curse my enemies , and behold , you have blessed them altogether . "
he answered and said , " Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth ? "
he took him into the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , and built seven altars , and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar .
he said to Balak , " Stand here by your burnt offering , while I meet over there . "
Yahweh met Balaam , and put a word in his mouth , and said , " Return to Balak , and say this . "
he came to him , and behold , he was standing by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . Balak said to him , " What has Yahweh spoken ? "
he took up his parable , and said , " Rise up , Balak , and hear ! listen to me , you son of Zippor .
God is not a man , that he should lie , nor the son of man , that he should repent . has he said , and will he not do it ? or has he spoken , and will he not make it good ?
behold , I have received a command to bless . he has blessed , and I can 't reverse it .
he has not seen iniquity in Jacob . neither has he seen perverseness in Israel . Yahweh his God is with him . the shout of a king is among them .
God brings them out of Egypt . he has as it were the strength of the wild ox .
surely there is no enchantment with Jacob ; Neither is there any divination with Israel . now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What has God done !
behold , the people rises up as a lioness , As a lion he lifts himself up . he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drinks the blood of the slain . "
Balak said to Balaam , " Neither curse them at all , nor bless them at all . "
but Balaam answered Balak , " Didn 't I tell you , saying , ' All that Yahweh speaks , that I must do ? ' "
Balak said to Balaam , " Come now , I will take you to another place ; perhaps it will please God that you may curse me them from there . "
Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor , that looks down on the desert .
Balaam said to Balak , " Build me here seven altars , and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams . "
Balak did as Balaam had said , and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar .
when Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel , he didn 't go , as at the other times , to meet with enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes ; and the Spirit of God came on him .
he took up his parable , and said , " Balaam the son of Beor says , the man whose eye was closed says ;
he says , who hears the words of God , who sees the vision of the Almighty , falling down , and having his eyes open :
how goodly are your tents , Jacob , and your tents , Israel !
as valleys they are spread forth , as gardens by the riverside , as aloes which Yahweh has planted , as cedar trees beside the waters .
water shall flow from his buckets . his seed shall be in many waters . his king shall be higher than Agag . his kingdom shall be exalted .
God brings him out of Egypt . he has as it were the strength of the wild ox . he shall eat up the nations his adversaries , shall break their bones in pieces , and Pierce them with his arrows .
he couched , he lay down as a lion , as a lioness ; who shall rouse him up ? everyone who blesses you is blessed . everyone who curses you is Cursed . "
Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he struck his hands together ; and Balak said to Balaam , " I called you to curse my enemies , and , behold , you have altogether blessed them these three times .
therefore now flee you to your place ! I thought to promote you to great honor ; but , behold , Yahweh has kept you back from honor . "
now , behold , I go to my people : come , I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days . "
he took up his parable , and said , " Balaam the son of Beor says , the man whose eye was closed says ;
he says , who hears the words of God , knows the knowledge of the Most High , and who sees the vision of the Almighty , Falling down , and having his eyes open :
I see him , but not now . I see him , but not near . a star will come out of Jacob . a scepter will rise out of Israel , and shall strike through the corners of Moab , and break down all the sons of Sheth .
Edom shall be a possession . Seir , his enemies , also shall be a possession , while Israel does valiantly .
out of Jacob shall one have dominion , and shall destroy the remnant from the city . "
he looked at Amalek , and took up his parable , and said , " Amalek was the first of the nations , But his latter end shall come to destruction . "
he looked at the Kenite , and took up his parable , and said , " Your dwelling place is strong . your nest is set in the rock .
nevertheless Kain shall be wasted , until Asshur carries you away captive . "
he took up his parable , and said , " Alas , who shall live when God does this ?
but ships shall come from the coast of Kittim . they shall afflict Asshur , and shall afflict Eber . he also shall come to destruction . "
Balaam rose up , and went and returned to his place ; and Balak also went his way .
Israel stayed in Shittim ; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab :
for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods ; and the people ate , and bowed down to their gods .
Israel joined himself to Baal Peor : and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Take all the chiefs of the people , and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun , that the fierce anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel . "
Moses said to the judges of Israel , " Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor . "
behold , one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses , and in the sight of all the Congregation of the children of Israel , while they were weeping at the door of the tent of Meeting .
when Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he rose up from the midst of the Congregation , and took a spear in his hand ;
those who died by the plague were twenty @-@ four thousand .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
therefore say , ' behold , I give to him my Covenant of peace :
and it shall be to him , and to his seed after him , the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was Jealous for his God , and made Atonement for the children of Israel . ' "
now the name of the man of Israel that was slain , who was slain with the Midianite woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a fathers ' house among the Simeonites .
the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was head of the people of a fathers ' house in Midian .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Reuben , the firstborn of Israel ; the sons of Reuben : of Hanoch , the family of the Hanochites ; of Pallu , the family of the Palluites ;
these are the families of the Reubenites ; and those who were numbered of them were forty @-@ three thousand seven hundred thirty .
the sons of Pallu : Eliab .
the sons of Eliab : Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . these are that Dathan and Abiram , who were called of the Congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against Yahweh ,
and the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up together with Korah , when that company died ; what time the fire devoured two hundred fifty men , and they became a sign .
notwithstanding , the sons of Korah didn 't die .
the sons of Simeon after their families : of Nemuel , the family of the Nemuelites ; of Jamin , the family of the Jaminites ; of Jachin , the family of the Jachinites ;
these are the families of the Simeonites , twenty @-@ two thousand two hundred .

these are the families of the Zebulunites according to those who were numbered of them , sixty thousand five hundred .
the sons of Joseph after their families : Manasseh and Ephraim .
the sons of Manasseh : of Machir , the family of the Machirites ; and Machir became the father of Gilead ; of Gilead , the family of the Gileadites .
these are the sons of Gilead : of Iezer , the family of the Iezerites ; of Helek , the family of the Helekites ;
and Shemida , the family of the Shemidaites ; and Hepher , the family of the Hepherites .
Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons , but daughters : and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
these are the families of Manasseh ; and those who were numbered of them were fifty @-@ two thousand seven hundred .
these are the sons of Ephraim after their families : of Shuthelah , the family of the Shuthelahites ; of Becher , the family of the Becherites ; of Tahan , the family of the Tahanites .

Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" to these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names .
to the more you shall give the more inheritance , and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance : to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given .
notwithstanding , the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
according to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer . "
these are those who were numbered of the Levites after their families : of Gershon , the family of the Gershonites ; of Kohath , the family of the Kohathites ; of Merari , the family of the Merarites .
these are the families of Levi : the family of the Libnites , the family of the Hebronites , the family of the Mahlites , the family of the Mushites , the family of the Korahites . Kohath became the father of Amram .
the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , who was born to Levi in Egypt : and she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
to Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
Nadab and Abihu died , when they offered strange fire before Yahweh .
those who were numbered of them were twenty @-@ three thousand , every male from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of Israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel .
these are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho .
but among these there was not a man of them who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
" our father died in the wilderness , and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah : but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family , because he had no son ? give to us a possession among the brothers of our father . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" the daughters of Zelophehad speak right : you shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father 's brothers ; and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them .
you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' If a man dies , and has no son , then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter .
if he has no daughter , then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers .
if he has no brothers , then you shall give his inheritance to his father 's brothers .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go up into this mountain of Abarim , and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel .
when you have seen it , you also shall be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother was gathered ;
because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin , in the strife of the Congregation , to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes . " ( these are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin . )
Moses spoke to Yahweh , saying ,
who may go out before them , and who may come in before them , and who may lead them out , and who may bring them in ; that the Congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which have no shepherd . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Take Joshua the son of nun , a man in whom is the Spirit , and lay your hand on him ;
and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the Congregation ; and commission him in their sight .
you shall put of your honor on him , that all the Congregation of the children of Israel may obey .
he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the Congregation . "
Moses did as Yahweh commanded him ; and he took Joshua , and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the Congregation :
and he laid his hands on him , and commissioned him , as Yahweh spoke by Moses .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' My offering , my food for my offerings made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to me , you shall observe to offer to me in their due season . '
you shall tell them , ' This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to Yahweh : male lambs a year old without blemish , two day by day , for a continual burnt offering .
you shall offer the one lamb in the morning , and you shall offer the other lamb at evening ;
with the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil .
it is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a pleasant aroma , an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
its drink offering shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb . you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to Yahweh in the holy place .
" ' on the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish , and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , and the drink offering of it :
this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath , besides the continual burnt offering , and the drink offering of it .
" ' in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh : two young bulls , and one ram , seven male lambs a year old without blemish ;
and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for each bull ; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for the one ram ;
and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb ; for a burnt offering of a pleasant aroma , an offering made by fire to Yahweh .
their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull , and the third part of a hin for the ram , and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb : this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
one male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh ; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering , and the drink offering of it .
" ' in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month , is Yahweh 's Passover .
on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast : seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten .
in the first day shall be a holy convocation : you shall do no servile work ;
but you shall offer an offering made by fire , a burnt offering to Yahweh : two young bulls , and one ram , and seven male lambs a year old ; they shall be to you without blemish ;
and their meal offering , fine flour mixed with oil : you shall offer three tenth parts for a bull , and two tenth parts for the ram .

Moses told the children of Israel according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses .
Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded .
when a man vows a vow to Yahweh , or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond , he shall not break his word ; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth .
" also when a woman vows a vow to Yahweh , and binds herself by a bond , being in her father 's house , in her youth ,
and her father hears her vow , and her bond with which she has bound her soul , and her father holds his peace at her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand .
but if her father disallow her in the day that he hears , none of her vows , or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul , shall stand : and Yahweh will forgive her , because her father disallowed her .
" if she has a husband , while her vows are on her , or the rash utterance of her lips , with which she has bound her soul ,
and her husband hears it , and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it ; then her vows shall stand , and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand .
but if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it , then he shall make void her vow which is on her , and the rash utterance of her lips , with which she has bound her soul : and Yahweh will forgive her .
" but the vow of a widow , or of her who is divorced , everything with which she has bound her soul , shall stand against her .
" if she vowed in her husband 's house , or bound her soul by a bond with an oath ,
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and didn 't disallow her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand .
but if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them , then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her soul , shall not stand : her husband has made them void ; and Yahweh will forgive her .
every vow , and every binding oath to afflict the soul , her husband may establish it , or her husband may make it void .
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day , then he establishes all her vows , or all her bonds , which are on her : he has established them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
but if he shall make them null and void after that he has heard them , then he shall bear her iniquity . "
these are the statutes , which Yahweh commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , between a father and his daughter , being in her youth , in her father 's house .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Moses spoke to the people , saying , " ARM men from among you for the war , that they may go against Midian , to execute Yahweh 's vengeance on Midian .
of every tribe one thousand , throughout all the tribes of Israel , you shall send to the war . "
so there were delivered , out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
Moses sent them , one thousand of every tribe , to the war , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand .
they warred against Midian , as Yahweh commanded Moses ; and they killed every male .
they killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain : Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , the five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword .
the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones ; and all their livestock , and all their flocks , and all their goods , they took for a prey .
all their cities in the places in which they lived , and all their encampments , they burnt with fire .
they took all the spoil , and all the prey , both of man and of animal .
they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , to Moses , and to Eleazar the priest , and to the Congregation of the children of Israel , to the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by the Jordan at Jericho .
Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and all the princes of the Congregation , went forth to meet them outside of the camp .
Moses was angry with the officers of the army , the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , who came from the service of the war .
Moses said to them , " Have you saved all the women alive ?
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor , and so the plague was among the Congregation of Yahweh .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him .
but all the girls , who have not known man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
" Encamp outside of the camp seven days : whoever has killed any person , and whoever has touched any slain , purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day , you and your captives .
as to every garment , and all that is made of skin , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood , you shall purify yourselves . "
Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle , " This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses :
you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day , and you shall be clean ; and afterward you shall come into the camp . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of animal , you , and Eleazar the priest , and the heads of the fathers ' households of the Congregation ;
and divide the prey into two parts : between the men skilled in war , who went out to battle , and all the Congregation .
levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle : one soul of five hundred ; of the persons , of the cattle , of the donkeys , and of the flocks .
take it of their half , and give it to Eleazar the priest , for Yahweh 's wave offering .
Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses .
now the prey , over and above the booty which the men of war took , was six hundred seventy @-@ five thousand sheep ,
and seventy @-@ two thousand head of cattle ,
and sixty @-@ one thousand donkeys ,
and thirty @-@ two thousand persons in all , of the women who had not known man by lying with him .
the half , which was the portion of those who went out to war , was in number three hundred thirty @-@ seven thousand five hundred sheep :
and Yahweh 's tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy @-@ five .
the cattle were thirty @-@ six thousand ; of which Yahweh 's tribute was seventy @-@ two .
the donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred ; of which Yahweh 's tribute was sixty @-@ one .
the persons were sixteen thousand ; of whom Yahweh 's tribute was thirty @-@ two persons .
Moses gave the tribute , which was Yahweh 's wave offering , to Eleazar the priest , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
of the children of Israel 's half , which Moses divided off from the men who warred
( now the Congregation 's half was three hundred thirty @-@ seven thousand five hundred sheep ,
and thirty @-@ six thousand head of cattle ,
and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys ,
and sixteen thousand persons ) ,
even of the children of Israel 's half , Moses took one drawn out of every fifty , both of man and of animal , and gave them to the Levites , who performed the duty of the tabernacle of Yahweh ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the captains of thousands , and the captains of hundreds , came near to Moses ;
and they said to Moses , " Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command , and there lacks not one man of us .
Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold , even all worked jewels .
all the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels .
( the men of war had taken booty , every man for himself . )
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tent of Meeting , for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh .
now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock : and when they saw the land of Jazer , and the land of Gilead , that behold , the place was a place for livestock ;
they said , " If we have found favor in your sight , let this land be given to your servants for a possession ; don 't bring us over the Jordan . "
Moses said to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , " shall your brothers go to the war , and shall you sit here ?
why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them ?
your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land .
for when they went up to the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them .
Yahweh 's anger was kindled in that day , and he swore , saying ,
except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite , and Joshua the son of nun ; because they have followed Yahweh completely . '
Yahweh 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh , was consumed .
" behold , you have risen up in your fathers ' place , an increase of sinful men , to augment yet the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel .
for if you turn away from after him , he will yet again leave them in the wilderness ; and you will destroy all this people . "
they came near to him , and said , " We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock , and cities for our little ones :
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
we will not return to our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance .
for we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan , and forward ; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward . "
Moses said to them , " If you will do this thing , if you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war ,
and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh , until he has driven out his enemies from before him ,
and the land is subdued before Yahweh ; then afterward you shall return , and be guiltless towards Yahweh , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh .
" but if you will not do so , behold , you have sinned against Yahweh ; and be sure your sin will find you out .
build cities for your little ones , and folds for your sheep ; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth . "
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses , saying , " Your servants will do as my lord commands .
our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our livestock , shall be there in the cities of Gilead ;
but your servants will pass over , every man who is armed for war , before Yahweh to battle , as my lord says . "
so Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest , and to Joshua the son of nun , and to the heads of the fathers ' households of the tribes of the children of Israel .
but if they will not pass over with you armed , they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan . "
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , " As Yahweh has said to your servants , so will we do .
we will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan , and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan . "
Moses gave to them , even to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land , according to its cities and borders , even the cities of the surrounding land .
the children of Gad built Dibon , and Ataroth , and Aroer ,
the children of Reuben built Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Kiriathaim ,
the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead , and took it , and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein .
Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh ; and he lived therein .
Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns , and called them Havvoth Jair .
Nobah went and took Kenath , and its villages , and called it Nobah , after his own name .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Yahweh : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
they traveled from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the next day after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians ,

they traveled from Ezion Geber , and encamped in the wilderness of Zin ( the same is Kadesh ) .
they traveled from Kadesh , and encamped in Mount Hor , in the edge of the land of Edom .
Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment of Yahweh , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fifth month , on the first day of the month .
Aaron was one hundred twenty @-@ three years old when he died in Mount Hor .
the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the South in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .

they traveled from the mountains of Abarim , and encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho .
they encamped by the Jordan , from Beth Jeshimoth even to Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab .
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho , saying ,
speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , " When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , destroy all their stone idols , destroy all their molten images , and demolish all their high places .
you shall take possession of the land , and dwell therein ; for I have given given the land to you to possess it .
" but if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you , then those you let remain of them will be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides , and they will harass you in the land in which you dwell .
it shall happen that as I thought to do to them , so will I do to you . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land of Canaan ( this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan according to its borders ) ,
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom , and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward ;
and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass along to Zin ; and the goings out of it shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea ; and it shall go forth to Hazar Addar , and pass along to Azmon ;
and the border shall turn about from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
" ' for the western border , you shall have the great sea and its border : this shall be your west border .
" ' this shall be your north border : from the great sea you shall mark out for you Mount Hor ;
from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad ;
and the border shall go forth to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar Enan : this shall be your north border .
" ' you shall mark out your east border from Hazar Enan to Shepham ;
and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall go down , and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward ;
and the border shall go down to the Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea . this shall be your land according to its borders around it . ' "
Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , " This is the land which you shall inherit by lot , which Yahweh has commanded to give to the nine tribes , and to the half @-@ tribe ;
for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers ' houses , and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers ' houses , have received , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh have received , their inheritance :
the two tribes and the half @-@ tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward , toward the sunrise . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" these are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance : Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of nun .
you shall take one prince of every tribe , to divide the land for inheritance .
these are the names of the men : of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .

of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince , Ahihud the son of Shelomi .
of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince , Pedahel the son of Ammihud . "
these are they whom Yahweh commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan .
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho , saying ,
" command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites .
the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock , and for their substance , and for all their animals .
" the suburbs of the cities , which you shall give to the Levites , shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it .
" the cities which you shall give to the Levites , they shall be the six cities of refuge , which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to : and besides them you shall give forty @-@ two cities .
all the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty @-@ eight cities together with their suburbs .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you , that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there .
the cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger , that the manslayer not die , until he stands before the Congregation for judgment .
the cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge .
you shall give three cities beyond the Jordan , and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan ; they shall be cities of refuge .
for the children of Israel , and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them , shall these six cities be for refuge ; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there .
" ' but if he struck him with an instrument of iron , so that he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
if he struck him with a stone in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
the avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death : when he meets him , he shall put him to death .
if he thrust him of hatred , or hurled at him , lying in wait , so that he died ,
or in enmity struck him with his hand , so that he died ; he who struck him shall surely be put to death ; he is a murderer : the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death , when he meets him .
" ' but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity , or hurled on him anything without lying in wait ,
or with any stone , by which a man may die , not seeing him , and cast it on him , so that he died , and he was not his enemy , neither sought his harm ;
then the Congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances ;
and the Congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood , and the Congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge , where he was fled : and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest , who was anointed with the holy oil .
" ' but if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge , where he flees ,
and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge , and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood ,
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession .
" ' these things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
" ' whoever kills any person , the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die .
" ' moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death ; but he shall surely be put to death .
" ' you shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge , that he may come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
" ' so you shall not pollute the land in which you are : for blood , it pollutes the land ; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him who shed it .
you shall not defile the land which you inhabit , in the midst of which I dwell : for I , Yahweh , dwell in the midst of the children of Israel . ' "
the heads of the fathers ' households of the family of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spoke before Moses , and before the princes , the heads of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel :
and they said , " Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters .
when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be , then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong : so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers . "
Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Yahweh , saying , " The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right .
this is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them be married to whom they think best ; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married .
so shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe ; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers .
so shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance . "
the daughters of Zelophehad did as Yahweh commanded Moses :
they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph ; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
these are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho .
it is eleven days ' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea .
it happened in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spoke to the children of Israel , according to all that Yahweh had given him in commandment to them ;
after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites , who lived in Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , who lived in Ashtaroth , at Edrei .
beyond the Jordan , in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this law , saying ,
" Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb , saying , You have lived long enough in this mountain :
behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give to them and to their seed after them . "
I spoke to you at that time , saying , " I am not able to bear you myself alone :
Yahweh your God has multiplied you , and behold , you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude .
Yahweh , the God of your fathers , make you a thousand times as many as you are , and bless you , as he has promised you !
how can I myself alone bear your encumbrance , and your burden , and your strife ?
take wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes , and I will make them heads over you . "
you answered me , and said , " The thing which you have spoken is good to do . "
I commanded your judges at that time , saying , " Hear cases between your brothers , and judge righteously between a man and his brother , and the foreigner who is living with him .
I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do .
I said to you , " You have come to the hill country of the Amorites , which Yahweh our God gives to us .
behold , Yahweh your God has set the land before you : go up , take possession , as Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has spoken to you ; don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed . "
the thing pleased me well ; and I took twelve men of you , one man for every tribe :
and they turned and went up into the hill country , and came to the valley of Eshcol , and spied it out .
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us . "
yet you wouldn 't go up , but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God :
and you murmured in your tents , and said , " Because Yahweh hated us , he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
then I said to you , " Don 't dread , neither be afraid of them .
yet in this thing you didn 't believe Yahweh your God ,
who went before you in the way , to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to show you by what way you should go , and in the cloud by day .
Yahweh heard the voice of your words , and was angry , and swore , saying ,
also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes , saying , " You also shall not go in there :
Joshua the son of nun , who stands before you , he shall go in there : encourage you him ; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
moreover your little ones , whom you said should be a prey , and your children , who this day have no knowledge of good or evil , they shall go in there , and to them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
but as for you , turn , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea . "
Yahweh said to me , " Tell them , ' Don 't go up , neither fight ; for I am not among you ; lest you be struck before your enemies . ' "
so I spoke to you , and you didn 't listen ; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh , and were presumptuous , and went up into the hill country .
the Amorites , who lived in that hill country , came out against you , and chased you , as bees do , and beat you down in Seir , even to Hormah .
you returned and wept before Yahweh ; but Yahweh didn 't listen to your voice , nor gave ear to you .
so you stayed in Kadesh many days , according to the days that you remained .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea , as Yahweh spoke to me ; and we encircled Mount Seir many days .
Yahweh spoke to me , saying ,
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yourselves therefore ;
Don 't contend with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on ; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession .
you shall purchase food of them for money , that you may eat ; and you shall also buy water of them for money , that you may drink . ' "
so we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber . we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
Yahweh said to me , " Don 't bother Moab , neither contend with them in battle ; for I will not give you of his land for a possession ; because I have given Ar to the children of lot for a possession . "
( the Emim lived therein before , a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakim :
these also are accounted Rephaim , as the Anakim ; but the Moabites call them Emim .
" now rise up , and cross over the Brook Zered . " we went over the Brook Zered .
moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them , to destroy them from the midst of the camp , until they were consumed .
so it happened , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
that Yahweh spoke to me , saying ,
" you are this day to pass over Ar , the border of Moab :
( that also is accounted a land of Rephaim : Rephaim lived therein before ; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim ,
a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakim ; but Yahweh destroyed them before them ; and they succeeded them , and lived in their place ;
as he did for the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , when he destroyed the Horites from before them ; and they succeeded them , and lived in their place even to this day :
and the Avvim , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Caphtorim , who came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" rise up , take your journey , and pass over the valley of the Arnon : behold , I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land ; begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
this day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky , who shall hear the report of you , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of you . "
I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace , saying ,
" let me pass through your land : I will go along by the highway , I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left .
Yahweh said to me , " behold , I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you : begin to possess , that you may inherit his land . "
then Sihon came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Jahaz .
Yahweh our God delivered him up before us ; and we struck him , and his sons , and all his people .
we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed every inhabited city , with the women and the little ones ; we left none remaining :
only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves , with the spoil of the cities which we had taken .
from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the valley , even to Gilead , there was not a city too high for us ; Yahweh our God delivered up all before us :
only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn 't come near ; all the side of the river Jabbok , and the cities of the hill country , and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us .
then we turned , and went up the way to Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
Yahweh said to me , " Don 't fear him ; for I have delivered him , and all his people , and his land , into your hand ; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites , who lived at Heshbon . "
so Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also , the king of Bashan , and all his people : and we struck him until none was left to him remaining .
we took all his cities at that time ; there was not a city which we didn 't take from them ; sixty cities , all the region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
all these were cities fortified with high walls , gates , and bars ; besides the unwalled towns a great many .
we utterly destroyed them , as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon , utterly destroying every inhabited city , with the women and the little ones .
but all the livestock , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey to ourselves .
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon .
( the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion , and the Amorites call it Senir . )
we took all the cities of the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , to Salecah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
( for only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; isn 't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon ? nine cubits was its length , and four cubits its breadth , after the cubit of a man . )
this land we took in possession at that time : from Aroer , which is by the valley of the Arnon , and half the hill country of Gilead , and its cities , gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites :
and the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , the kingdom of Og , gave I to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , even all Bashan . ( the same is called the land of Rephaim .
I gave Gilead to Machir .
to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon , the middle of the valley , and its border , even to the river Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
the Arabah also , and the Jordan and its border , from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah , the Salt Sea , under the slopes of Pisgah eastward .
I commanded you at that time , saying , " Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it : you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel , all the men of valor .
I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , " Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings : so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over .
you shall not fear them ; for Yahweh your God , he it is who fights for you . "
" Lord Yahweh , you have begun to show your servant your greatness , and your strong hand : for what god is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to your works , and according to your mighty acts ?
please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan , that goodly mountain , and Lebanon . "
but Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes , and didn 't listen to me ; and Yahweh said to me , " Let it suffice you ; speak no more to me of this matter .
go up to the top of Pisgah , and lift up your eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and see with your eyes : for you shall not go over this Jordan .
but commission Joshua , and encourage him , and strengthen him ; for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see . "
so we stayed in the valley over against Beth Peor .
you shall not add to the word which I command you , neither shall you diminish from it , that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you .
your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor ; for all the men who followed Baal Peor , Yahweh your God has destroyed them from the midst of you .
but you who were faithful to Yahweh your God are all alive this day .
behold , I have taught you statutes and ordinances , even as Yahweh my God commanded me , that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it .
for what great nation is there , that has a god so near to them , as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him ?
what great nation is there , that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law , which I set before you this day ?
only take heed to yourself , and keep your soul diligently , lest you forget the things which your eyes saw , and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life ; but make them known to your children and your children 's children ;
you came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky , with darkness , cloud , and thick darkness .
Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire : you heard the voice of words , but you saw no form ; you only heard a voice .
he declared to you his Covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even the ten commandments ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone .
Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances , that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it .
take therefore good heed to yourselves ; for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire .
but Yahweh has taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , out of Egypt , to be to him a people of inheritance , as at this day .
furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes , and swore that I should not go over the Jordan , and that I should not go in to that good land , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance :
but I must die in this land , I must not go over the Jordan ; but you shall go over , and possess that good land .
take heed to yourselves , lest you forget the Covenant of Yahweh your God , which he made with you , and make you an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you .
for Yahweh your God is a devouring fire , a Jealous God .
Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples , and you shall be left few in number among the nations , where Yahweh shall lead you away .
there you shall serve gods , the work of men 's hands , wood and stone , which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
but from there you shall seek Yahweh your God , and you shall find him , when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul .
when you are in oppression , and all these things have come on you , in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God , and listen to his voice :
for Yahweh your God is a merciful God ; he will not fail you , neither destroy you , nor forget the Covenant of your fathers which he swore to them .
did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as you have heard , and live ?
it was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is God . there is no one else besides him .
out of heaven he made you to hear his voice , that he might instruct you : and on earth he made you to see his great fire ; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire .
because he loved your fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought you out with his presence , with his great power , out of Egypt ;
to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you , to bring you in , to give you their land for an inheritance , as at this day .
know therefore this day , and lay it to your heart , that Yahweh he is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath ; there is none else .
then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise ;
that the manslayer might flee there , who kills his neighbor unawares , and didn 't hate him in time past ; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live :
Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , for the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , for the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , for the Manassites .
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which Moses spoke to the children of Israel , when they came forth out of Egypt ,
they took his land in possession , and the land of Og king of Bashan , the two kings of the Amorites , who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise ;
from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , even to Mount Sion ( the same is Hermon ) ,
and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward , even to the sea of the Arabah , under the slopes of Pisgah .
Moses called to all Israel , and said to them , Hear , Israel , the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day , that you may learn them , and observe to do them .
Yahweh our God made a Covenant with us in Horeb .
Yahweh didn 't make this Covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire ,
( I stood between Yahweh and you at that time , to show you the word of Yahweh : for you were afraid because of the fire , and didn 't go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
" you shall have no other gods before me .
" you shall not make an engraved image for yourself , any likeness of what is in heaven above , or what is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
you shall not bow down yourself to them , nor serve them ; for I , Yahweh , your God , am a Jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me ;
and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments .
" you shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain : for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain .
" observe the Sabbath day , to keep it holy , as Yahweh your God commanded you .
you shall labor six days , and do all your work ;
you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt , and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm : therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day .
" honor your father and your mother , as Yahweh your God commanded you ; that your days may be long , and that it may go well with you , in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
" you shall not murder .
" neither shall you steal .
" neither shall you give false testimony against your neighbor .
" neither shall you covet your neighbor 's wife ; neither shall you desire your neighbor 's house , his field , or his male servant , or his female servant , his ox , or his donkey , or anything that is your neighbor 's . "
it happened , when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , while the mountain was burning with fire , that you came near to me , even all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ;
and you said , " behold , Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that God does speak with man , and he lives .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more , then we shall die .
for who is there of all flesh , that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
go near , and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say : and tell us all that Yahweh our God shall tell you ; and we will hear it , and do it . "
Yahweh heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Yahweh said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
Oh that there were such a heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children forever !
" go tell them , Return to your tents .
you shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you : you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
you shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess .
now this is the commandment , the statutes , and the ordinances , which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you , that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it ;
that you might fear Yahweh your God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prolonged .
hear therefore , Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with you , and that you may increase mightily , as Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has promised to you , in a land flowing with milk and honey .
hear , Israel : Yahweh is our God ; Yahweh is one :
and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your might .
these words , which I command you this day , shall be on your heart ;
and you shall teach them diligently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
you shall bind them for a sign on your hand , and they shall be for symbols between your eyes .
you shall write them on the door posts of your house , and on your gates .
then beware lest you forget Yahweh , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
you shall fear Yahweh your God ; and you shall serve him , and shall swear by his name .
you shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the peoples who are around you ;
for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a Jealous God ; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you , and he destroy you from off the face of the earth .
you shall not tempt Yahweh your God , as you tempted him in Massah .
you shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he has commanded you .
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers ,
to thrust out all your enemies from before you , as Yahweh has spoken .
when your son asks you in time to come , saying , " What do the testimonies , the statutes , and the ordinances , which Yahweh our God has commanded you mean ? "
then you shall tell your son , " We were Pharaoh 's bondservants in Egypt : and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand ;
and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt , on Pharaoh , and on all his house , before our eyes ;
and he brought us out from there , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he swore to our fathers .
Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes , to fear Yahweh our God , for our good always , that he might preserve us alive , as at this day .
it shall be righteousness to us , if we observe to do all this commandment before Yahweh our God , as he has commanded us . "
and when Yahweh your God shall deliver them up before you , and you shall strike them ; then you shall utterly destroy them : you shall make no Covenant with them , nor show mercy to them ;
neither shall you make marriages with them ; your daughter you shall not give to his son , nor shall you take his daughter for your son .
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so the anger of Yahweh would be kindled against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their altars , and dash their pillars in pieces , and cut down their Asherim , and burn their engraved images with fire .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God : Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
Yahweh didn 't set his love on you , nor choose you , because you were more in number than any people ; for you were the fewest of all peoples :
but because Yahweh loves you , and because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers , has Yahweh brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
know therefore that Yahweh your God , he is God , the faithful God , who keeps Covenant and loving kindness with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations ,
and repays those who hate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be Slack to him who hates him , he will repay him to his face .
you shall therefore keep the commandment , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which I command you this day , to do them .
it shall happen , because you listen to these ordinances , and keep and do them , that Yahweh your God will keep with you the Covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers :
you shall be blessed above all peoples : there shall not be male or female barren among you , or among your livestock .
Yahweh will take away from you all sickness ; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who hate you .
you shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you ; your eye shall not pity them : neither shall you serve their gods ; for that will be a snare to you .
if you shall say in your heart , " These nations are more than I ; how can I dispossess them ? "
you shall not be afraid of them : you shall well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh , and to all Egypt ;
moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them , until those who are left , and hide themselves , perish from before you .
you shall not be scared of them ; for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you , a great and awesome God .
Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little : you may not consume them at once , lest the animals of the field increase on you .
but Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you , and will confuse them with a great confusion , until they be destroyed .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall observe to do all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers .
your clothing didn 't grow old on you , neither did your foot swell , these forty years .
you shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son , so Yahweh your God chastens you .
you shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
for Yahweh your God brings you into a good land , a land of brooks of water , of springs , and underground water flowing into valleys and hills ;
a land of wheat and barley , and vines and fig trees and pomegranates ; a land of olive trees and honey ;
a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness , you shall not lack anything in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hills you may dig copper .
you shall eat and be full , and you shall bless Yahweh your God for the good land which he has given you .
beware lest you forget Yahweh your God , in not keeping his commandments , and his ordinances , and his statutes , which I command you this day :
lest , when you have eaten and are full , and have built goodly houses , and lived therein ;
and when your herds and your flocks multiply , and your silver and your gold is multiplied , and all that you have is multiplied ;
then your heart be lifted up , and you forget Yahweh your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage ;
who led you through the great and terrible wilderness , with fiery Serpents and Scorpions , and thirsty ground where there was no water ; who brought you forth water out of the rock of Flint ;
who fed you in the wilderness with manna , which your fathers didn 't know ; that he might humble you , and that he might prove you , to do you good at your latter end :
and lest you say in your heart , " My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth . "
but you shall remember Yahweh your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his Covenant which he swore to your fathers , as at this day .
it shall be , if you shall forget Yahweh your God , and walk after other gods , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish .
as the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you , so you shall perish ; because you wouldn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
a people great and tall , the sons of the Anakim , whom you know , and of whom you have heard say , " Who can stand before the sons of Anak ? "
know therefore , that Yahweh your God doesn 't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness ; for you are a stiff @-@ necked people .
remember , don 't forget , how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt , until you came to this place , you have been rebellious against Yahweh .
also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath , and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you .
when I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant which Yahweh made with you , then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights ; I neither ate bread nor drank water .
Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant .
Yahweh said to me , " arise , get down quickly from here ; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a molten image . "
furthermore Yahweh spoke to me , saying , " I have seen this people , and behold , it is a stiff @-@ necked people :
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from under the sky ; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they . "
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the Covenant were in my two hands .
I looked , and behold , you had sinned against Yahweh your God ; you had made yourselves a molten calf : you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you .
I took hold of the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and broke them before your eyes .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you . but Yahweh listened to me that time also .
Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him : and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time .
when Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea , saying , " Go up and possess the land which I have given you " ; then you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God , and you didn 't believe him , nor listen to his voice .
you have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you .
so I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down , because Yahweh had said he would destroy you .
I prayed to Yahweh , and said , " Lord Yahweh , don 't destroy your people and your inheritance , that you have redeemed through your greatness , that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
remember your servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; don 't look to the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin ,
lest the land you brought us out from say , ' Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them , and because he hated them , he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness . '
yet they are your people and your inheritance , which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm . "
at that time Yahweh said to me , " Cut two tables of stone like the first , and come up to me onto the mountain , and make an Ark of wood .
I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke , and you shall put them in the Ark . "
so I made an Ark of acacia wood , and cut two tables of stone like the first , and went up onto the mountain , having the two tables in my hand .
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Yahweh gave them to me .
I turned and came down from the mountain , and put the tables in the Ark which I had made ; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me .
( the children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his place .
from there they traveled to Gudgodah ; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah , a land of brooks of water .
therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers ; Yahweh is his inheritance , according as Yahweh your God spoke to him . )
I stayed on the mountain , as at the first time , forty days and forty nights : and Yahweh listened to me that time also ; Yahweh would not destroy you .
Yahweh said to me , " arise , take your journey before the people ; and they shall go in and possess the land , which I swore to their fathers to give to them . "
to keep the commandments of Yahweh , and his statutes , which I command you this day for your good ?
behold , to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens , the earth , with all that is therein .
only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them , and he chose their seed after them , even you above all peoples , as at this day .
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart , and be no more stiff @-@ necked .
for Yahweh your God , he is God of gods , and Lord of lords , the great God , the mighty , and the awesome , who doesn 't respect persons , nor takes reward .
he does execute justice for the fatherless and widow , and loves the foreigner , in giving him food and clothing .
therefore love the foreigner ; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt .
you shall fear Yahweh your God ; you shall serve him ; and you shall cling to him , and you shall swear by his name .
he is your praise , and he is your God , who has done for you these great and awesome things , which your eyes have seen .
your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons ; and now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude .
therefore you shall love Yahweh your God , and keep his instructions , and his statutes , and his ordinances , and his commandments , always .
know this day : for I don 't speak with your children who have not known , and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his outstretched arm ,
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and to all his land ;
and what he did to the army of Egypt , to their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day ;
and what he did to you in the wilderness , until you came to this place ;
but your eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which he did .
therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may be strong , and go in and possess the land , where you go over to possess it ;
and that you may prolong your days in the land , which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed , a land flowing with milk and honey .
for the land , where you go in to possess it , isn 't as the land of Egypt , that you came out from , where you sowed your seed , and watered it with your foot , as a garden of herbs ;
but the land , where you go over to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water of the rain of the sky ,
a land which Yahweh your God cares for : the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it , from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year .
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day , to love Yahweh your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
that I will give the rain of your land in its season , the former rain and the latter rain , that you may gather in your grain , and your new wine , and your oil .
I will give grass in your fields for your livestock , and you shall eat and be full .
take heed to yourselves , lest your heart be deceived , and you turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ;
and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you , and he shut up the sky , so that there shall be no rain , and the land shall not yield its fruit ; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you .
therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul ; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand , and they shall be for symbols between your eyes .
you shall teach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
you shall write them on the door posts of your house , and on your gates ;
for if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you , to do it , to love Yahweh your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cling to him ;
then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you , and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves .
every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even to the hinder sea shall be your border .
no man shall be able to stand before you : Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on , as he has spoken to you .
behold , I set before you this day a blessing and a curse :
the blessing , if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , which I command you this day ;
and the curse , if you shall not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which you have not known .
it shall happen , when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it , that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim , and the curse on Mount Ebal .
Aren 't they beyond the Jordan , behind the way of the going down of the sun , in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah , over against Gilgal , beside the oaks of Moreh ?
for you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you , and you shall possess it , and dwell therein .
you shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day .
these are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has given you to possess it , all the days that you live on the earth .
you shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods , on the high mountains , and on the hills , and under every green tree :
and you shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars , and burn their Asherim with fire ; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods ; and you shall destroy their name out of that place .
you shall not do so to Yahweh your God .
but to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes , to put his name there , even to his habitation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and the wave offering of your hand , and your vows , and your freewill offerings , and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock :
and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God , and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Yahweh your God has blessed you .
you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatever is right in his own eyes ;
for you haven 't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance , which Yahweh your God gives you .
but when you go over the Jordan , and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit , and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you , so that you dwell in safety ;
then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there , there you shall bring all that I command you : your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the wave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh .
take heed to yourself that you don 't offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see ;
but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
only you shall not eat the blood ; you shall pour it out on the earth as water .
you may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain , or of your new wine , or of your oil , or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock , nor any of your vows which you vow , nor your freewill offerings , nor the wave offering of your hand ;
take heed to yourself that you don 't forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land .
when Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border , as he has promised you , and you shall say , " I want to eat meat , " because your soul desires to eat meat ; you may eat meat , after all the desire of your soul .
if the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to put his name there , is too far from you , then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock , which Yahweh has given you , as I have commanded you ; and you may eat within your gates , after all the desire of your soul .
even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten , so you shall eat of it : the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike .
only be sure that you don 't eat the blood : for the blood is the life ; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh .
you shall not eat it ; you shall pour it out on the earth as water .
you shall not eat it ; that it may go well with you , and with your children after you , when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh .
only your holy things which you have , and your vows , you shall take , and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose :
and you shall offer your burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and you shall eat the flesh .
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you forever , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
when Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you , where you go in to dispossess them , and you dispossess them , and dwell in their land ;
take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them , after that they are destroyed from before you ; and that you not inquire after their gods , saying , " How do these nations serve their gods ? I will do likewise . "
you shall not do so to Yahweh your God : for every abomination to Yahweh , which he hates , have they done to their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods .
whatever thing I command you , that you shall observe to do : you shall not add thereto , nor diminish from it .
if there arise in the midst of you a prophet , or a dreamer of dreams , and he give you a sign or a wonder ,
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , of which he spoke to you , saying , " Let us go after other gods " ( which you have not known ) " and let us serve them " ;
you shall not listen to the words of that prophet , or to that dreamer of dreams : for Yahweh your God proves you , to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
you shall walk after Yahweh your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and you shall serve him , and cling to him .
you shall not consent to him , nor listen to him ; neither shall your eye pity him , neither shall you spare , neither shall you conceal him :
but you shall surely kill him ; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall not do any more such wickedness as this is in the midst of you .
then you shall inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in the midst of you ,
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and its livestock , with the edge of the sword .
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and show you mercy , and have compassion on you , and multiply you , as he has sworn to your fathers ;
when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep all his commandments which I command you this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
you are the children of Yahweh your God : you shall not cut yourselves , nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God , and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
you shall not eat any abominable thing .
these are the animals which you may eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
the hart , and the gazelle , and the roebuck , and the wild goat , and the ibex , and the antelope , and the chamois .
every animal that parts the hoof , and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud , among the animals , that may you eat .
the pig , because it has a split hoof but doesn 't chew the cud , is unclean to you : of their flesh you shall not eat , and their carcasses you shall not touch .
these you may eat of all that are in the waters : whatever has fins and scales may you eat ;
and whatever doesn 't have fins and scales you shall not eat ; it is unclean to you .
of all clean birds you may eat .
but these are they of which you shall not eat : the eagle , and the vulture , and the osprey ,
and the red kite , and the falcon , and the kite after its kind ,
and every raven after its kind ,
and the ostrich , and the owl , and the seagull , and the hawk after its kind ,
the little owl , and the great owl , and the horned owl ,
and the stork , and the heron after its kind , and the hoopoe , and the BAT .
all winged creeping things are unclean to you : they shall not be eaten .
of all clean birds you may eat .
you shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed , that which comes forth from the field year by year .
then you shall turn it into money , and bind up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose :
the Levite who is within your gates , you shall not forsake him ; for he has no portion nor inheritance with you .
at the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year , and shall lay it up within your gates :
at the end of every seven years you shall make a release .
this is the way of the release : every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother ; because Yahweh 's release has been proclaimed .
of a foreigner you may exact it : but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release .
for Yahweh your God will bless you , as he promised you : and you shall lend to many nations , but you shall not borrow ; and you shall rule over many nations , but they shall not rule over you .
if a poor man , one of your brothers , is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives you , you shall not harden your heart , nor shut your hand from your poor brother ;
but you shall surely open your hand to him , and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need , which he lacks .
you shall surely give him , and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him ; because that for this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work , and in all that you put your hand to .
for the poor will never cease out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall surely open your hand to your brother , to your needy , and to your poor , in your land .
if your brother , a Hebrew man , or a Hebrew woman , is sold to you , and serves you six years ; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you .
when you let him go free from you , you shall not let him go empty :
you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock , and out of your threshing floor , and out of your winepress ; as Yahweh your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
you shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt , and Yahweh your God redeemed you : therefore I command you this thing today .
it shall be , if he tells you , " I will not go out from you " ; because he loves you and your house , because he is well with you ;
then you shall take an awl , and thrust it through his ear to the door , and he shall be your servant forever . also to your female servant you shall do likewise .
all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify to Yahweh your God : you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd , nor shear the firstborn of your flock .
you shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place which Yahweh shall choose , you and your household .
if it has any blemish , is lame or blind , or has any defect whatever , you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God .
you shall eat it within your gates : the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike , as the gazelle , and as the hart .
only you shall not eat its blood ; you shall pour it out on the ground as water .
observe the month of Abib , and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God ; for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night .
you shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which Yahweh shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
no yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days ; neither shall any of the flesh , which you sacrifice the first day at evening , remain all night until the morning .
you may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates , which Yahweh your God gives you ;
but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell in , there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening , at the going down of the sun , at the season that you came forth out of Egypt .
you shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose : and you shall turn in the morning , and go to your tents .
six days you shall eat unleavened bread . on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God ; you shall do no work .
you shall count for yourselves seven weeks : from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yahweh your God blesses you :
you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt : and you shall observe and do these statutes .
you shall keep the feast of tents seven days , after that you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress :
and you shall rejoice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male servant , and your female servant , and the Levite , and the foreigner , and the fatherless , and the widow , who are within your gates .
you shall keep a feast to Yahweh your God seven days in the place which Yahweh shall choose ; because Yahweh your God will bless you in all your increase , and in all the work of your hands , and you shall be altogether joyful .
every man shall give as he is able , according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you .
you shall make judges and officers in all your gates , which Yahweh your God gives you , according to your tribes ; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment .
you shall not wrest justice : you shall not respect persons ; neither shall you take a bribe ; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise , and pervert the words of the righteous .
you shall follow that which is altogether just , that you may live , and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
you shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Yahweh your God , which you shall make for yourselves .
neither shall you set yourself up a pillar ; which Yahweh your God hates .
you shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox , or a sheep , in which is a blemish , or anything evil ; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
if there is found in the midst of you , within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God , in transgressing his Covenant ,
and has gone and served other gods , and worshiped them , or the sun , or the moon , or any of the army of the sky , which I have not commanded ;
and it be told you , and you have heard of it , then you shall inquire diligently ; and behold , if it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in Israel ,
then you shall bring forth that man or that woman , who has done this evil thing , to your gates , even the man or the woman ; and you shall stone them to death with stones .
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterward the hand of all the people . so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
if there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within your gates ; then you shall arise , and go up to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose ;
and you shall come to the priests the Levites , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inquire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you :
according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach you , and according to the judgment which they shall tell you , you shall do ; you shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you , to the right hand , nor to the left .
the man who does presumptuously , in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the evil from Israel .
all the people shall hear , and fear , and do no more presumptuously .
when you have come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you , and shall possess it , and shall dwell therein , and shall say , " I will set a king over me , like all the nations that are around me " ;
you shall surely set him king over yourselves , whom Yahweh your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreigner over you , who is not your brother .
only he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he may multiply horses ; because Yahweh has said to you , " You shall not go back that way again . "
neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart not turn away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
it shall be , when he sits on the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book , out of that which is before the priests the Levites :
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life ; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them ;
that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers , and that he not turn aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he and his children , in the midst of Israel .
the priests the Levites , all the tribe of Levi , shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel : they shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire , and his inheritance .
they shall have no inheritance among their brothers : Yahweh is their inheritance , as he has spoken to them .
this shall be the priests ' due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep , that they shall give to the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
the first fruits of your grain , of your new wine , and of your oil , and the first of the Fleece of your sheep , you shall give him .
for Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes , to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh , him and his sons for ever .
if a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel , where he lives as a foreigner , and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God , as all his brothers the Levites do , who stand there before Yahweh .
they shall have like portions to eat , besides that which comes of the sale of his patrimony .
when you have come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you , you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations .
there shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , one who uses divination , one who practices sorcery , or an enchanter , or a sorcerer ,
for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh : and because of these abominations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you .
you shall be perfect with Yahweh your God .
for these nations , that you shall dispossess , listen to those who practice sorcery , and to diviners ; but as for you , Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do .
Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you , of your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him .
this is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
Yahweh said to me , " They have well said that which they have spoken .
I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers , like you ; and I will put my words in his mouth , and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him .
it shall happen , that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the prophet , who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other gods , that same prophet shall die . "
if you say in your heart , " How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken ? "
when Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations , whose land Yahweh your God gives you , and you succeed them , and dwell in their cities , and in their houses ;
you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land , which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
you shall prepare you the way , and divide the borders of your land , which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit , into three parts , that every manslayer may flee there .
this is the case of the manslayer , that shall flee there and live : whoever kills his neighbor unawares , and didn 't hate him in time past ;
therefore I command you , saying , You shall set apart three cities for yourselves .
that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , and so blood be on you .
but if any man hates his neighbor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mortally so that he dies , and he flees into one of these cities ;
then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there , and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
your eye shall not pity him , but you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with you .
you shall not remove your neighbor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inheritance which you shall inherit , in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sins : at the mouth of two witnesses , or at the mouth of three witnesses , shall a matter be established .
if an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing ,
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before Yahweh , before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make diligent Inquisition : and , behold , if the witness is a false witness , and has testified falsely against his brother ;
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
those who remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of you .
your eyes shall not pity : life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and see horses , chariots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Yahweh your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
it shall be , when you draw near to the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak to the people ,
and shall tell them , " Hear , Israel , you draw near this day to battle against your enemies : Don 't let your heart faint ; don 't be afraid , nor tremble , neither be scared of them ;
for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you . "
the officers shall speak to the people , saying , " What man is there who has built a new house , and has not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
what man is there who has planted a vineyard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
the officers shall speak further to the people , and they shall say , " What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted ? let him go and return to his house , lest his brother 's heart melt as his heart . "
it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people , that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people .
when you draw near to a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace to it .
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you , and shall serve you .
if it will make no peace with you , but will make war against you , then you shall besiege it :
and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand , you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword :
but the women , and the little ones , and the livestock , and all that is in the city , even all its spoil , you shall take for a prey to yourself ; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies , which Yahweh your God has given you .
thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but of the cities of these peoples , that Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , you shall save alive nothing that breathes ;
but you shall utterly destroy them : the Hittite , and the Amorite , the Canaanite , and the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite ; as Yahweh your God has commanded you ;
that they not teach you to do after all their abominations , which they have done to their gods ; so would you sin against Yahweh your God .
only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food , you shall destroy and cut them down ; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you , until it fall .
if one be found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it , lying in the field , and it isn 't known who has struck him ;
then your elders and your judges shall come forth , and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain :
and it shall be , that the city which is nearest to the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd , which hasn 't been worked with , and which has not drawn in the yoke ;
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water , which is neither plowed nor sown , and shall break the heifer 's neck there in the valley .
the priests the sons of Levi shall come near ; for them Yahweh your God has chosen to minister to him , and to bless in the name of Yahweh ; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be .
all the elders of that city , who are nearest to the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley ;
and they shall answer and say , " Our hands have not shed this blood , neither have our eyes seen it .
forgive , Yahweh , your people Israel , whom you have redeemed , and don 't allow innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel . " the blood shall be forgiven them .
so you shall put away the innocent blood from the midst of you , when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands , and you carry them away captive ,
and see among the captives a beautiful woman , and you have a desire to her , and would take her to you as wife ;
then you shall bring her home to your house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
it shall be , if you have no delight in her , then you shall let her go where she will ; but you shall not sell her at all for money , you shall not deal with her as a slave , because you have humbled her .
if a man have two wives , the one beloved , and the other hated , and they have borne him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated ;
then it shall be , in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has , that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated , who is the firstborn :
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , who will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and , though they chasten him , will not listen to them ;
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the elders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the elders of his city , " This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard . "
all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be put to death , and you hang him on a tree ;
his body shall not remain all night on the tree , but you shall surely bury him the same day ; for he who is hanged is accursed of God ; that you don 't defile your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance .
you shall not see your brother 's ox or his sheep go astray , and hide yourself from them : you shall surely bring them again to your brother .
so you shall do with his donkey ; and so you shall do with his garment ; and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother 's , which he has lost , and you have found : you may not hide yourself .
you shall not see your brother 's donkey or his ox fallen down by the way , and hide yourself from them : you shall surely help him to lift them up again .
a woman shall not wear men 's clothing , neither shall a man put on women 's clothing ; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before you in the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eggs , and the hen sitting on the young , or on the eggs , you shall not take the hen with the young :
you shall surely let the hen go , but the young you may take to yourself ; that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days .
when you build a new house , then you shall make a battlement for your roof , that you don 't bring blood on your house , if any man fall from there .
you shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed , lest the whole fruit be forfeited , the seed which you have sown , and the increase of the vineyard .
you shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together .
you shall not wear a mixed stuff , wool and linen together .
you shall make yourselves fringes on the four borders of your cloak , with which you cover yourself .
if any man takes a wife , and goes in to her , and hates her ,
and accuses her of shameful things , and brings up an evil name on her , and says , " I took this woman , and when I came near to her , I didn 't find in her the tokens of virginity " ;
then shall the father of the young lady , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady 's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate ;
the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him ;
but if this thing be true , that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady ;
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the evil from Israel .
if there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
for he found her in the field , the pledged to be married lady cried , and there was none to save her .
if a man find a lady who is a virgin , who is not pledged to be married , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has humbled her ; he may not put her away all his days .
a man shall not take his father 's wife , and shall not uncover his father 's skirt .
he who is wounded in the stones , or has his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh .
a Bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh ; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Yahweh .
an Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh ; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever :
because they didn 't meet you with bread and with water in the way , when you came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse you .
nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn 't listen to Balaam ; but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you , because Yahweh your God loved you .
you shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever .
you shall not abhor an Edomite ; for he is your brother : you shall not abhor an Egyptian , because you lived as a foreigner in his land .
the children of the third generation who are born to them shall enter into the assembly of Yahweh .
when you go forth in camp against your enemies , then you shall keep yourselves from every evil thing .
if there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night , then shall he go outside of the camp . he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening comes on , he shall bathe himself in water ; and when the sun is down , he shall come within the camp .
you shall have a place also outside of the camp , where you shall go forth abroad :
and you shall have a paddle among your weapons ; and it shall be , when you sit down abroad , you shall dig therewith , and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you :
for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp , to deliver you , and to give up your enemies before you ; therefore your camp shall be holy , that he may not see an unclean thing in you , and turn away from you .
you shall not deliver to his master a servant who is escaped from his master to you :
he shall dwell with you , in the midst of you , in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates , where it pleases him best : you shall not oppress him .
there shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel , neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel .
you shall not bring the hire of a prostitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow : for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
you shall not lend on interest to your brother ; interest of money , interest of food , interest of anything that is lent on interest :
to a foreigner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to possess it .
when you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God , you shall not be Slack to pay it : for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
but if you shall forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in you .
that which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God , a freewill offering , which you have promised with your mouth .
when you come into your neighbor 's vineyard , then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure ; but you shall not put any in your vessel .
when you come into your neighbor 's standing grain , then you may pluck the ears with your hand ; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor 's standing grain .
when a man takes a wife , and marries her , then it shall be , if she find no favor in his eyes , because he has found some unseemly thing in her , that he shall write her a bill of divorce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
when she is departed out of his house , she may go and be another man 's wife .
if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , who took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , who sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for that is abomination before Yahweh : and you shall not cause the land to sin , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance .
when a man takes a new wife , he shall not go out in the army , neither shall he be assigned any business : he shall be free at home one year , and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken .
no man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge ; for he takes a life in pledge .
if a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel , and he deal with him as a slave , or sell him ; then that thief shall die : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
take heed in the plague of leprosy , that you observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them , so you shall observe to do .
remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam , by the way as you came forth out of Egypt .
when you do lend your neighbor any kind of loan , you shall not go into his house to get his pledge .
you shall stand outside , and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you .
if he be a poor man , you shall not sleep with his pledge ;
you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down , that he may sleep in his garment , and bless you : and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God .
you shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
in his day you shall give him his hire , neither shall the sun go down on it ; for he is poor , and sets his heart on it : lest he cry against you to Yahweh , and it be sin to you .
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
you shall not deprive the foreigner , or the fatherless of justice , nor take a widow 's clothing in pledge ;
but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt , and Yahweh your God redeemed you there : therefore I command you to do this thing .
when you beat your olive tree , you shall not go over the boughs again : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
when you harvest your vineyard , you shall not glean it after yourselves : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
you shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt : therefore I command you to do this thing .
if there is a controversy between men , and they come to judgment , and the judges judge them ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked ;
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his wickedness , by number .
forty stripes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then your brother should seem vile to you .
it shall be , that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name not be blotted out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak to him : and if he stand , and say , " I don 't want to take her " ;
his name shall be called in Israel , The house of him who has his shoe untied .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him , and puts forth her hand , and takes him by the secrets ;
then you shall cut off her hand , your eye shall have no pity .
you shall not have in your bag diverse weights , a great and a small .
you shall not have in your house diverse measures , a great and a small .
you shall have a perfect and just weight . you shall have a perfect and just measure , that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
for all who do such things , all who do unrighteously , are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came forth out of Egypt ;
how he met you by the way , and struck the hindmost of you , all who were feeble behind you , when you were faint and weary ; and he didn 't fear God .
it shall be , when you have come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , and possess it , and dwell therein ,
that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground , which you shall bring in from your land that Yahweh your God gives you ; and you shall put it in a basket , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
you shall come to the priest who shall be in those days , and tell him , " I profess this day to Yahweh your God , that I am come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers to give us . "
the priest shall take the basket out of your hand , and set it down before the altar of Yahweh your God .
the Egyptians dealt ill with us , and afflicted us , and laid on us hard bondage :
and we cried to Yahweh , the God of our fathers , and Yahweh heard our voice , and saw our affliction , and our toil , and our oppression ;
and Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror , and with signs , and with wonders ;
and he has brought us into this place , and has given us this land , a land flowing with milk and honey .
now , behold , I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground , which you , Yahweh , have given me . " you shall set it down before Yahweh your God , and worship before Yahweh your God .
you shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Levite , and the foreigner who is in the midst of you .
look down from your holy habitation , from heaven , and bless your people Israel , and the ground which you have given us , as you swore to our fathers , a land flowing with milk and honey . "
this day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances : you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart , and with all your soul .
you have declared Yahweh this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his ordinances , and listen to his voice :
and Yahweh has declared you this day to be a people for his own possession , as he has promised you , and that you should keep all his commandments ;
and to make you high above all nations that he has made , in praise , and in name , and in honor ; and that you may be a holy people to Yahweh your God , as he has spoken .
Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people , saying , " keep all the commandment which I command you this day .
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you , that you shall set yourself up great stones , and plaster them with plaster :
it shall be , when you have passed over the Jordan , that you shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in Mount Ebal , and you shall plaster them with plaster .
there you shall build an altar to Yahweh your God , an altar of stones : you shall lift up no iron on them .
you shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones ; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God :
and you shall sacrifice peace offerings , and shall eat there ; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God .
you shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly . "
Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel , saying , " keep silence , and listen , Israel : this day you have become the people of Yahweh your God .
you shall therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command you this day . "
Moses commanded the people the same day , saying ,
" these shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people , when you have passed over the Jordan : Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Joseph , and Benjamin .
these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse : Reuben , Gad , and Asher , and Zebulun , Dan , and Naphtali .
the Levites shall answer , and tell all the men of Israel with a loud voice ,
'Cursed is he who sets light by his father or his mother . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who removes his neighbor 's landmark . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who makes the blind to wander out of the way . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who the foreigner , fatherless , and widow of justice . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who lies with his father 's wife , because he has uncovered his father 's skirt . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who lies with any kind of animal . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who lies with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who doesn 't confirm the words of this law to do them . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . ' "
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments which I command you this day , that Yahweh your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth :
and all these blessings shall come on you , and overtake you , if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
you shall be blessed in the city , and you shall be blessed in the field .
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
you shall be blessed when you come in , and you shall be blessed when you go out .
Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you . they will come out against you one way , and will flee before you seven ways .
Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns , and in all that you put your hand to ; and he will bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to himself , as he has sworn to you ; if you shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , and walk in his ways .
all the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of Yahweh ; and they shall be afraid of you .
Yahweh will make you the head , and not the tail ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be beneath ; if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day , that all these curses shall come on you , and overtake you .
you shall be Cursed in the city , and you shall be Cursed in the field .
the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock shall be Cursed .
you shall be Cursed when you come in , and you shall be Cursed when you go out .
Yahweh will make the pestilence cling to you , until he has consumed you from off the land , where you go in to possess it .
Yahweh will strike you with consumption , and with fever , and with inflammation , and with fiery heat , and with the sword , and with blight , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue you until you perish .
your sky that is over your head shall be brass , and the earth that is under you shall be iron .
Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust : from the sky shall it come down on you , until you are destroyed .
Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies ; you shall go out one way against them , and shall flee seven ways before them : and you shall be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth .
your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky , and to the animals of the earth ; and there shall be none to frighten them away .
Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt , and with the tumors , and with the scurvy , and with the itch , of which you can not be healed .
Yahweh will strike you with madness , and with blindness , and with astonishment of heart ;
and you shall grope at noonday , as the blind gropes in darkness , and you shall not prosper in your ways : and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always , and there shall be none to save you .
you shall betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not dwell therein : you shall plant a vineyard , and shall not use its fruit .
your ox shall be slain before your eyes , and you shall not eat of it : your donkey shall be violently taken away from before your face , and shall not be restored to you : your sheep shall be given to your enemies , and you shall have none to save you .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
the fruit of your ground , and all your labors , shall a nation which you don 't know eat up ; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always ;
so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which you shall see .
Yahweh will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
Yahweh will bring you , and your king whom you shall set over you , to a nation that you have not known , you nor your fathers ; and there you shall serve other gods , wood and stone .
you shall become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all the peoples where Yahweh shall lead you away .
you shall carry much seed out into the field , and shall gather little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
you shall plant vineyards and dress them , but you shall neither drink of the wine , nor harvest ; for the worm shall eat them .
you shall have olive trees throughout all your borders , but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil ; for your olives shall drop off .
you shall father sons and daughters , but they shall not be yours ; for they shall go into captivity .
all your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess .
the foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above you higher and higher ; and you shall come down lower and lower .
he shall lend to you , and you shall not lend to him : he shall be the head , and you shall be the tail .
all these curses shall come on you , and shall pursue you , and overtake you , until you are destroyed ; because you didn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you :
and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder , and on your seed forever .
because you didn 't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , by reason of the abundance of all things ;
they shall besiege you in all your gates , until your high and fortified walls come down , in which you trusted , throughout all your land ; and they shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land , which Yahweh your God has given you .
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the flesh of your sons and of your daughters , whom Yahweh your God has given you , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates .
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this glorious and fearful name , YAHWEH your God ;
then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful , and the plagues of your seed , even great plagues , and of long continuance , and severe sicknesses , and of long continuance .
he will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt , which you were afraid of ; and they shall cling to you .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , Yahweh will bring them on you , until you are destroyed .
you shall be left few in number , whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude ; because you didn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
it shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you , so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it .
Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples , from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth ; and there you shall serve other gods , which you have not known , you nor your fathers , even wood and stone .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and pining of soul ;
and your life shall hang in doubt before you ; and you shall fear night and day , and shall have no assurance of your life .
these are the words of the Covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , besides the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
Moses called to all Israel , and said to them , You have seen all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ;
the great trials which your eyes saw , the signs , and those great wonders :
but Yahweh has not given you a heart to know , and eyes to see , and ears to hear , to this day .
I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes have not grown old on you , and your shoes have not grown old on your feet .
you have not eaten bread , neither have you drunk wine or strong drink ; that you may know that I am Yahweh your God .
when you came to this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , came out against us to battle , and we struck them :
and we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half @-@ tribe of the Manassites .
keep therefore the words of this Covenant , and do them , that you may prosper in all that you do .
that you may enter into the Covenant of Yahweh your God , and into his oath , which Yahweh your God makes with you this day ;
that he may establish you this day to himself for a people , and that he may be to you a God , as he spoke to you , and as he swore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
neither with you only do I make this Covenant and this oath ,
( for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt , and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed ;
and you have seen their abominations , and their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them ) ;
Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the Covenant that is written in this book of the law .
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreigner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick ;
even all the nations shall say , " Why has Yahweh done thus to this land ? what does the heat of this great anger mean ? "
then men shall say , " Because they forsook the Covenant of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
and went and served other gods , and worshiped them , gods that they didn 't know , and that he had not given to them :
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land , to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book ;
and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as at this day . "
the secret things belong to Yahweh our God ; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever , that we may do all the words of this law .
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Yahweh your God has driven you ,
and shall return to Yahweh your God , and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your soul ;
that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity , and have compassion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yahweh your God has scattered you .
if your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens , from there will Yahweh your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :
and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it ; and he will do you good , and multiply you above your fathers .
Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart , and the heart of your seed , to love Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , that you may live .
Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies , and on those who hate you , who persecuted you .
you shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh , and do all his commandments which I command you this day .
if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law ; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul .
for this commandment which I command you this day , it is not too hard for you , neither is it far off .
it is not in heaven , that you should say , " Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it to us , and make us to hear it , that we may do it ? "
neither is it beyond the sea , that you should say , " Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it to us , and make us to hear it , that we may do it ? "
but the word is very near to you , in your mouth , and in your heart , that you may do it .
behold , I have set before you this day life and good , and death and evil ;
but if your heart turns away , and you will not hear , but shall be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
I denounce to you this day , that you shall surely perish ; you shall not prolong your days in the land , where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it .
Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel .
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yahweh has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Yahweh your God , he will go over before you ; he will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dispossess them . Joshua shall go over before you , as Yahweh has spoken .
Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og , the kings of the Amorites , and to their land ; whom he destroyed .
Yahweh will deliver them up before you , and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you .
be strong and courageous , don 't be afraid , nor be scared of them : for Yahweh your God , he it is who does go with you ; he will not fail you , nor forsake you . "
Yahweh , he it is who does go before you ; he will be with you , he will not fail you , neither forsake you : Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed . "
Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi , who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and to all the elders of Israel .
Moses commanded them , saying , " At the end of every seven years , in the set time of the year of release , in the feast of tents ,
when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose , you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
assemble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreigner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Yahweh your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
and that their children , who have not known , may hear , and learn to fear Yahweh your God , as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it . "
Yahweh appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud : and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the tent .
I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked , in that they are turned to other gods .
" now therefore write this song for yourselves , and teach it to the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers , flowing with milk and honey , and they shall have eaten and filled themselves , and grown fat ; then will they turn to other gods , and serve them , and despise me , and break my Covenant .
so Moses wrote this song the same day , and taught it the children of Israel .
he commissioned Joshua the son of nun , and said , " Be strong and courageous ; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them : and I will be with you . "
it happened , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
that Moses commanded the Levites , who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , saying ,
" take this book of the law , and put it by the side of the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh your God , that it may be there for a witness against you .
for I know your rebellion , and your stiff neck : behold , while I am yet alive with you this day , you have been rebellious against Yahweh ; and how much more after my death ?
assemble to me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to witness against them .
Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song , until they were finished .
give ear , you heavens , and I will speak . let the earth hear the words of my mouth .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain . my speech shall condense as the dew , as the small rain on the tender grass , as the showers on the herb .
for I will proclaim the name of Yahweh . Ascribe greatness to our God !
the Rock , his work is perfect , for all his ways are justice : a God of faithfulness and without iniquity , just and right is he .
they have dealt corruptly with him . they are not his children , because of their defect . they are a perverse and crooked generation .
do you thus requite Yahweh , foolish people and unwise ? Isn 't he your father who has bought you ? he has made you , and established you .
remember the days of old . consider the years of many generations . ask your father , and he will show you ; your elders , and they will tell you .
when the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the children of men , he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel .
for Yahweh 's portion is his people . Jacob is the lot of his inheritance .
he found him in a desert land , in the waste howling wilderness . he surrounded him . he cared for him . he kept him as the apple of his eye .
as an eagle that stirs up her nest , that flutters over her young , he spread abroad his wings , he took them , he bore them on his feathers .
Yahweh alone led him . there was no foreign god with him .
he made him ride on the high places of the earth . he ate the increase of the field . he caused him to suck honey out of the rock , oil out of the flinty rock ;
but Jeshurun grew fat , and kicked . you have grown fat . you have grown thick . you have become sleek . then he forsook God who made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
they moved him to jealousy with strange gods . they provoked him to anger with abominations .
they sacrificed to demons , not God , to gods that they didn 't know , to new gods that came up recently , which your fathers didn 't dread .
of the Rock who became your father , you are unmindful , and have forgotten God who gave you birth .
Yahweh saw and abhorred , because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters .
he said , " I will hide my face from them . I will see what their end shall be ; for they are a very perverse generation , children in whom is no faithfulness .
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God . they have provoked me to anger with their vanities . I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people . I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
for a fire is kindled in my anger , Burns to the lowest Sheol , devours the earth with its increase , and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire .
" I will heap evils on them . I will spend my arrows on them .
they shall be wasted with hunger , and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction . I will send the teeth of animals on them , With the poison of crawling things of the dust .
outside the sword shall bereave , and in the rooms , terror ; on both young man and virgin , The nursing infant with the gray @-@ haired man .
I said , I would scatter them afar . I would make their memory to cease from among men ;
were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy , lest their adversaries should judge wrongly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is exalted , Yahweh has not done all this . ' "
for they are a nation void of counsel . there is no understanding in them .
Oh that they were wise , that they understood this , that they would consider their latter end !
for their rock is not as our Rock , even our enemies themselves being judges .
for their vine is of the vine of Sodom , of the fields of Gomorrah . their grapes are grapes of gall , Their clusters are bitter .
their wine is the poison of Serpents , The cruel venom of asps .
" Isn 't this laid up in store with me , sealed up among my treasures ?
vengeance is mine , and recompense , at the time when their foot slides ; for the day of their calamity is at hand . the things that are to come on them shall make haste . "
for Yahweh will judge his people , and have compassion on his servants , when he sees that their power is gone , There is none remaining , shut up or left at large .
he will say , " Where are their gods , The rock in which they took refuge ;
which ate the fat of their sacrifices , And drank the wine of their drink offering ? let them rise up and help you ! let them be your protection .
for I lift up my hand to heaven , And say , As I live forever ,
if I whet my glittering sword , My hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to my adversaries , and will recompense those who hate me .
I will make my arrows drunk with blood . my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives , from the head of the leaders of the enemy . "
rejoice , you nations , with his people , for he will avenge the blood of his servants . he will render vengeance to his adversaries , And will make expiation for his land , for his people .
Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he and Joshua the son of nun .
for it is no vain thing for you ; because it is your life , and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land , where you go over the Jordan to possess it . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day , saying ,
" go up into this mountain of Abarim , to Mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and see the land of Canaan , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
and die on the mountain where you go up , and be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor , and was gathered to his people :
because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because you didn 't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel .
for you shall see the land before you ; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel . "
this is the blessing , with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death .
yes , he loves the people . all his saints are in your hand . they sat down at your feet ; each receives your words .
Moses commanded us a law , An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob .
he was king in Jeshurun , When the heads of the people were gathered , All the tribes of Israel together .
" let Reuben live , and not die ; Nor let his men be few . "
of Levi he said , " Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one , whom you proved at Massah , with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah ;
who said of his father , and of his mother , ' I have not seen him ; ' Neither did he acknowledge his brothers , Nor did he know his own children : for they have observed your word , and keep your Covenant .
they shall teach Jacob your ordinances , and Israel your law . they shall put incense before you , and whole burnt offering on your altar .
of Benjamin he said , " The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell in safety by him . he covers him all the day long . he dwells between his shoulders . "
of Joseph he said , " His land is blessed by Yahweh , for the precious things of the heavens , for the dew , for the deep that couches beneath ,
for the precious things of the fruits of the sun , for the precious things of the growth of the moons ,
for the chief things of the ancient mountains , for the precious things of the everlasting hills ,
of Zebulun he said , " rejoice , Zebulun , in your going out ; and Issachar , in your tents .
they shall call the peoples to the mountain . there they will offer sacrifices of righteousness , for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas , the hidden treasures of the sand . "
of Gad he said , " He who enlarges Gad is blessed . he dwells as a lioness , and tears the arm , yes , the crown of the head .
of Dan he said , " Dan is a lion 's cub that leaps out of Bashan . "
of Naphtali he said , " Naphtali , satisfied with favor , full of the blessing of Yahweh , possess the west and the south . "
of Asher he said , " Asher is blessed with children . let him be acceptable to his brothers . let him dip his foot in oil .
your bars shall be iron and brass . as your days , so your strength will be .
" there is none like God , Jeshurun , who rides on the heavens for your help , In his excellency on the skies .
the eternal God is your dwelling place . underneath are the everlasting arms . he thrust out the enemy from before you , and said , ' Destroy ! '
Israel dwells in safety ; the fountain of Jacob alone , In a land of grain and new wine . yes , his heavens drop down dew .
Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho . Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead , to Dan ,
and all Naphtali , and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh , and all the land of Judah , to the hinder sea ,
and the South , and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees , to Zoar .
Yahweh said to him , " This is the land which I swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , ' I will give it to your seed . ' I have caused you to see it with your eyes , but you shall not go over there . "
so Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of Yahweh .
he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor : but no man knows of his tomb to this day .
Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died : his eye was not dim , nor his natural force abated .
the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days : so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended .
Joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom ; for Moses had laid his hands on him : and the children of Israel listened to him , and did as Yahweh commanded Moses .
there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses , whom Yahweh knew face to face ,
in all the signs and the wonders , which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt , to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ,
and in all the mighty hand , and in all the great terror , which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel .
now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh , that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of nun , Moses ' servant , saying ,
" Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , you , and all this people , to the land which I give to them , even to the children of Israel .
I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on , as I told Moses .
from the wilderness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Moses , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor forsake you .
" be strong and courageous ; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them .
this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth , but you shall meditate on it day and night , that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then you shall make your way prosperous , and then you shall have good success .
haven 't I commanded you ? be strong and courageous . Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed : for Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go . "
then Joshua commanded the officers of the people , saying ,
Joshua spoke to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , saying ,
" remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you , saying , ' Yahweh your God gives you rest , and will give you this land .
they answered Joshua , saying , " All that you have commanded us we will do , and wherever you send us we will go .
just as we listened to Moses in all things , so will we listen to you . only may Yahweh your God be with you , as he was with Moses .
whoever rebels against your commandment , and doesn 't listen to your words in all that you command him , he shall be put to death . only be strong and courageous . "
the king of Jericho was told , " behold , men of the children of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land . "
the king of Jericho sent to Rahab , saying , " Bring out the men who have come to you , who have entered into your house ; for they have come to spy out all the land . "
the woman took the two men and hid them . then she said , " Yes , the men came to me , but I didn 't know where they came from .
it happened about the time of the shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don 't know . pursue them quickly ; for you will overtake them . "
but she had brought them up to the roof , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order on the roof .
the men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords : and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out , they shut the gate .
before they had laid down , she came up to them on the roof ;
and she said to the men , " I know that Yahweh has given you the land , and that the fear of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you .
as soon as we had heard it , our hearts melted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yahweh your God , he is God in heaven above , and on earth beneath .
then she let them down by a cord through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
she said to them , " Go to the mountain , lest the pursuers find you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers have returned . afterward , you may go your way . "
the men said to her , " We will be guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to swear .
behold , when we come into the land , you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you used to let us down . you shall gather to yourself into the house your father , your mother , your brothers , and all your father 's household .
but if you talk about this business of ours , then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear . "
she said , " According to your words , so be it . " she sent them away , and they departed . she tied the scarlet line in the window .
they went , and came to the mountain , and stayed there three days , until the pursuers had returned . the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but didn 't find them .
then the two men returned , descended from the mountain , passed over , and came to Joshua the son of nun ; and they told him all that had happened to them .
they said to Joshua , " Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands all the land . moreover , all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us . "
Joshua rose up early in the morning ; and they moved from Shittim , and came to the Jordan , he and all the children of Israel . they lodged there before they passed over .
it happened after three days , that the officers went through the midst of the camp ;
and they commanded the people , saying , " When you see the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh your God , and the priests the Levites bearing it , then you shall move from your place , and follow it .
Joshua said to the people , " Sanctify yourselves ; for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders among you . "
Joshua spoke to the priests , saying , " Take up the Ark of the Covenant , and pass over before the people . " they took up the Ark of the Covenant , and went before the people .
you shall command the priests who bear the Ark of the Covenant , saying , ' When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan , you shall stand still in the Jordan . ' "
Joshua said to the children of Israel , " Come here , and hear the words of Yahweh your God . "
Joshua said , " Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Hivite , and the Perizzite , and the Girgashite , and the Amorite , and the Jebusite out from before you .
behold , the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan .
now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel , for every tribe a man .
it happened , when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan , the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant being before the people ,
and when those who bore the Ark had come to the Jordan , and the feet of the priests who bore the Ark had dipped in the edge of the water ( for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest ) ,
it happened , when all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan , that Yahweh spoke to Joshua , saying ,
" take twelve men out of the people , out of every tribe a man ,
then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
that this may be a sign among you , that when your children ask in time to come , saying , ' What do you mean by these stones ? '
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
it happened , when all the people had completely passed over , that the Ark of Yahweh passed over , with the priests , in the presence of the people .
the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spoke to them .
about forty thousand men , ready and armed for war passed over before Yahweh to battle , to the plains of Jericho .
on that day , Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
Yahweh spoke to Joshua , saying ,
Joshua therefore commanded the priests , saying , " Come up out of the Jordan ! "
it happened , when the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan , and the soles of the priests ' feet were lifted up to the dry ground , that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place , and went over all its banks , as before .
the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , on the east border of Jericho .
Joshua set up those twelve stones , which they took out of the Jordan , in Gilgal .
he spoke to the children of Israel , saying , " When your children ask their fathers in time to come , saying , ' What do these stones mean ? '
then you shall let your children know , saying , ' Israel came over this Jordan on dry land .
for Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until you had passed over , as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea , which he dried up from before us , until we had passed over ;
that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh , that it is mighty ; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever . ' "
at that time , Yahweh said to Joshua , " Make Flint knives , and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time . "
Joshua made himself Flint knives , and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins .
this is the reason Joshua circumcised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
for all the people who came out were circumcised ; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised .
their children , whom he raised up in their place , were circumcised by Joshua ; for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them on the way .
it happened , when they were done circumcising all the nation , that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed .
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you . " therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal , to this day .
the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal . they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho .
they ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover , in the same day .
the manna ceased on the next day , after they had eaten of the produce of the land . the children of Israel didn 't have manna any more ; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
the prince of Yahweh 's army said to Joshua , " Take your shoes off of your feet ; for the place on which you stand is holy . " Joshua did so .
now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel . no one went out , and no one came in .
Yahweh said to Joshua , " behold , I have given Jericho into your hand , with its king and the mighty men of valor .
all your men of war shall march around the city , going around the city once . you shall do this six days .
seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the Ark . on the seventh day , you shall march around the city seven times , and the priests shall blow the trumpets .
Joshua the son of nun called the priests , and said to them , " Take up the Ark of the Covenant , and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the Ark of Yahweh . "
they said to the people , " Advance ! March around the city , and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh 's Ark . "
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns before Yahweh advanced , and blew the trumpets ; and the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh followed them .
the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets , and the Ark went after them . the trumpets sounded as they went .
so he caused the Ark of Yahweh to go around the city , going about it once . then they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
Joshua rose early in the morning , and the priests took up the Ark of Yahweh .
the second day they marched around the city once , and returned into the camp . they did this six days .
it happened on the seventh day , that they rose early at the dawning of the day , and marched around the city in the same way seven times . only on this day they marched around the city seven times .
it happened at the seventh time , when the priests blew the trumpets , Joshua said to the people , " shout , for Yahweh has given you the city !
the city shall be devoted , even it and all that is in it , to Yahweh . only Rahab the prostitute shall live , she and all who are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
but as for you , only keep yourselves from the devoted thing , lest when you have devoted it , you take of the devoted thing ; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are holy to Yahweh . they shall come into Yahweh 's treasury . "
they utterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , both young and old , and ox , and sheep , and donkey , with the edge of the sword .
Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land , " Go into the prostitute 's house , and bring out from there the woman and all that she has , as you swore to her . "
the young men who were spies went in , and brought out Rahab with her father , her mother , her brothers , and all that she had . they also brought out all her relatives , and they set them outside of the camp of Israel .
they burnt the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh 's house .
but Rahab the prostitute , her father 's household , and all that she had , Joshua saved alive . she lived in the midst of Israel to this day , because she hid the messengers , whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
so Yahweh was with Joshua ; and his fame was in all the land .
but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things ; for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , took some of the devoted things . therefore Yahweh 's anger burned against the children of Israel .
Joshua sent men from Jericho to AI , which is beside Beth Aven , on the east side of Bethel , and spoke to them , saying , " Go up and spy out the land . " the men went up and spied out AI .
so about three thousand men of the people went up there , and they fled before the men of AI .
the men of AI struck about thirty @-@ six men of them , and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim , and struck them at the descent . the hearts of the people melted , and became like water .
Joshua said , " Alas , Lord Yahweh , why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to cause us to perish ? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan !
Oh , Lord , what shall I say , after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies !
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Get up ! why are you fallen on your face like that ?
it shall be , that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire , he and all that he has , because he has transgressed the Covenant of Yahweh , and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel . ' "
so Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes . the tribe of Judah was selected .
he brought near the family of Judah ; and he selected the family of the Zerahites . he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man , and Zabdi was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was selected .
Achan answered Joshua , and said , " I have truly sinned against Yahweh , the God of Israel , and this is what I have done .
so Joshua sent messengers , and they ran to the tent . behold , it was hidden in his tent , with the silver under it .
they took them from the middle of the tent , and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel . they laid them down before Yahweh .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up to AI . Joshua chose thirty thousand men , the mighty men of valor , and sent them out by night .
he commanded them , saying , " behold , you shall lie in ambush against the city , behind the city . Don 't go very far from the city , but all of you be ready .
I , and all the people who are with me , will approach to the city . it shall happen , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
and you shall rise up from the ambush , and take possession of the city ; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand .
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yahweh . behold , I have commanded you . "
Joshua sent them out ; and they went to set up the ambush , and stayed between Bethel and AI , on the west side of AI ; but Joshua stayed among the people that night .
Joshua rose up early in the morning , mustered the people , and went up , he and the elders of Israel , before the people to AI .
all the people , even the men of war who were with him , went up , and drew near , and came before the city , and encamped on the north side of AI . now there was a valley between him and AI .
he took about five thousand men , and set them in ambush between Bethel and AI , on the west side of the city .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their ambush on the west of the city ; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them , and fled by the way of the wilderness .
all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them . they pursued Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
there was not a man left in AI or Beth El who didn 't go out after Israel . they left the city open , and pursued Israel .
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward AI , for I will give it into your hand . " Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city .
the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hurried and set the city on fire .
when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and killed the men of AI .
the others came out of the city against them , so they were in the midst of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side . they struck them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
they captured the king of AI alive , and brought him to Joshua .
it happened , when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of AI in the field , in the wilderness in which they pursued them , and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all Israel returned to AI , and struck it with the edge of the sword .
all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of AI .
for Joshua didn 't draw back his hand , with which he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of AI .
only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves , according to the word of Yahweh which he commanded Joshua .
so Joshua burnt AI , and made it a heap forever , even a desolation , to this day .
then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh , the God of Israel , in Mount Ebal ,
he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
afterward he read all the words of the law , the blessing and the curse , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
it happened , when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan , in the hill country , and in the lowland , and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite , heard of it
that they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel , with one accord .
but when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to AI ,
they also resorted to a ruse , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks on their donkeys , and wineskins , old and torn and bound up ,
and old and patched shoes on their feet , and wore old garments . all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy .
they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal , and said to him , and to the men of Israel , " We have come from a far country . now therefore make a Covenant with us . "
the men of Israel said to the Hivites , " What if you live among us . how could we make a Covenant with you ? "
they said to Joshua , " We are your servants . " Joshua said to them , " Who are you ? where do you come from ? "
they said to him , " Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God ; for we have heard of his fame , all that he did in Egypt ,
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan , who was at Ashtaroth .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and has become moldy .
these wineskins , which we filled , were new ; and behold , they are torn . these our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey . "
the men sampled their provisions , and didn 't ask counsel from the mouth of Yahweh .
Joshua made peace with them , and made a Covenant with them , to let them live . the princes of the Congregation swore to them .
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a Covenant with them , that they heard that they were their neighbors , and that they lived among them .
the children of Israel traveled and came to their cities on the third day . now their cities were Gibeon , Chephirah , Beeroth , and Kiriath Jearim .
the children of Israel didn 't strike them , because the princes of the Congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh , the God of Israel . all the Congregation murmured against the princes .
but all the princes said to all the Congregation , " We have sworn to them by Yahweh , the God of Israel : now therefore we may not touch them .
this we will do to them , and let them live ; lest wrath be on us , because of the oath which we swore to them . "
Joshua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying , " Why have you deceived us , saying , ' We are very far from you , ' when you live among us ?
now therefore you are Cursed , and some of you will never fail to be bondservants , both wood cutters and Drawers of water for the house of my God . "
now , behold , we are in your hand . do to us as it seems good and right to you to do . "
he did so to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , so that they didn 't kill them .
that they were very afraid , because Gibeon was a great city , as one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than AI , and all its men were mighty .
therefore Adoni @-@ Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron , to Piram king of Jarmuth , to Japhia king of Lachish , and to Debir king of Eglon , saying ,
" come up to me , and help me , and let us strike Gibeon ; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel . "
therefore the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their armies , and encamped against Gibeon , and made war against it .
so Joshua went up from Gilgal , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valor .
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Don 't fear them , for I have delivered them into your hands . not a man of them will stand before you . "
Joshua therefore came on them suddenly . he went up from Gilgal all night .
Yahweh confused them before Israel , and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon , and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah .
there was no day like that before it or after it , that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man ; for Yahweh fought for Israel .
Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to the camp to Gilgal .
these five kings fled , and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah .
Joshua was told , saying , " The five kings are found , hidden in the cave at Makkedah . "
Joshua said , " roll large stones to the mouth of the cave , and set men by it to guard them ;
but don 't stay . pursue your enemies , and them from the rear . Don 't allow them to enter into their cities ; for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand . "
it happened , when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed , and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities ,
that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace . none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
then Joshua said , " Open the mouth of the cave , and bring those five kings out of the cave to me . "
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
Joshua said to them , " Don 't be afraid , nor be dismayed . be strong and courageous , for Yahweh will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight . "
afterward Joshua struck them , put them to death , and hanged them on five trees . they were hanging on the trees until the evening .
Joshua took Makkedah on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with its king . he utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining . he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho .
Joshua passed from Makkedah , and all Israel with him , to Libnah , and fought against Libnah .
Yahweh delivered it also , with its king , into the hand of Israel . he struck it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining in it . he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho .
Joshua passed from Libnah , and all Israel with him , to Lachish , and encamped against it , and fought against it .
Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel . he took it on the second day , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with all the souls who were in it , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish ; and Joshua struck him and his people , until he had left him none remaining .
Joshua passed from Lachish , and all Israel with him , to Eglon ; and they encamped against it fought against it .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword . he utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
Joshua went up from Eglon , and all Israel with him , to Hebron ; and they fought against it .
they took it , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with its king and all its cities , and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but he utterly destroyed it , and all the souls who were in it .
Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to Debir , and fought against it .
Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza , and all the country of Goshen , even to Gibeon .
Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time , because Yahweh , the God of Israel , fought for Israel .
Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to the camp to Gilgal .
it happened , when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , to the king of Shimron , to the king of Achshaph ,
and to the kings who were on the north , in the hill country , in the Arabah south of Chinneroth , in the lowland , and in the heights of Dor on the west ,
to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the hill country , and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah .
they went out , they and all their armies with them , many people , even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude , with very many horses and chariots .
all these kings met together ; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom , to fight with Israel .
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Don 't be afraid because of them ; for tomorrow at this time , I will deliver them up all slain before Israel . you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire . "
so Joshua came , and all the people of war with him , against them by the waters of Merom suddenly , and fell on them .
Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel , and they struck them , and chased them to great Sidon , and to Misrephoth Maim , and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward . they struck them until they left them none remaining .
Joshua did to them as Yahweh told him . he hamstrung their horses and burnt their chariots with fire .
Joshua turned back at that time , and took Hazor , and struck its king with the sword : for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms .
they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them . there was no one left who breathed . he burnt Hazor with fire .
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded .
but as for the cities that stood on their mounds , Israel burned none of them , except Hazor only . Joshua burned that .
the children of Israel took all the spoil of these cities , with the livestock , as spoils for themselves ; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them . they didn 't leave any who breathed .
as Yahweh commanded Moses his servant , so Moses commanded Joshua . Joshua did so . he left nothing undone of all that Yahweh commanded Moses .
Joshua made war a long time with all those kings .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , except the Hivites , the inhabitants of Gibeon . they took all in battle .
for it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts , to come against Israel in battle , that he might utterly destroy them , that they might have no favor , but that he might destroy them , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
Joshua came at that time , and cut off the Anakim from the hill country , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the hill country of Judah , and from all the hill country of Israel : Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities .
there were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel . only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , did some remain .
so Joshua took the whole land , according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . the land had rest from war .
now these are the kings of the land , whom the children of Israel struck , and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon , and all the Arabah eastward :
and the border of Og king of Bashan , of the remnant of the Rephaim , who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
and ruled in Mount Hermon , and in Salecah , and in all Bashan , to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites , and half Gilead , the border of Sihon king of Heshbon .
Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them . Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh .
the king of Jericho , one ; the king of AI , which is beside Bethel , one ;
the king of Jarmuth , one ; the king of Lachish , one ;
the king of Eglon , one ; the king of Gezer , one ;
the king of Debir , one ; the king of Geder , one ;
the king of Hormah , one ; the king of Arad , one ;
the king of Libnah , one ; the king of Adullam , one ;
the king of Makkedah , one ; the king of Bethel , one ;
the king of Tappuah , one ; the king of Hepher , one ;
the king of Aphek , one ; the king of Lassharon , one ;
the king of Madon , one ; the king of Hazor , one ;
the king of Shimron Meron , one ; the king of Achshaph , one ;
the king of Taanach , one ; the king of Megiddo , one ;
the king of Kedesh , one ; the king of Jokneam in Carmel , one ;
the king of Dor in the height of Dor , one ; the king of Goiim in Gilgal , one ;
the king of Tirzah , one : all the kings thirty @-@ one .
now Joshua was old and well advanced in years . Yahweh said to him , " You are old and advanced in years , and there remains yet very much land to be possessed .
" this is the land that still remains : all the regions of the Philistines , and all the Geshurites ;
on the south ; all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians , to Aphek , to the border of the Amorites ;
and the land of the Gebalites , and all Lebanon , toward the sunrise , from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath ;
now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh . "
with him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond the Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them :
from Aroer , that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the middle of the valley , and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon ;
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , to the border of the children of Ammon ;
and Gilead , and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites , and all Mount Hermon , and all Bashan to Salecah ;
nevertheless the children of Israel didn 't drive out the Geshurites , nor the Maacathites : but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day .
only he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi . the offerings of Yahweh , the God of Israel , made by fire are his inheritance , as he spoke to him .
Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families .
their border was from Aroer , that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the middle of the valley , and all the plain by Medeba ;
Heshbon , and all its cities that are in the plain ; Dibon , Bamoth Baal , Beth Baal Meon ,
Kiriathaim , Sibmah , Zereth Shahar in the mount of the valley ,
Beth Peor , the slopes of Pisgah , Beth Jeshimoth ,
the children of Israel alse killed Balaam also the son of Beor , the soothsayer , with the sword , among the rest of their slain .
the border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan . this was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families , the cities and its villages .
Moses gave to the tribe of Gad , to the children of Gad , according to their families .
their border was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , to Aroer that is before Rabbah ;
and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh , and Betonim ; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir ;
this is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families , the cities and its villages .
Moses gave an inheritance to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh . it was for the half @-@ tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families .
their border was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , sixty cities .
these are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab , beyond the Jordan at Jericho , eastward .
but to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance . Yahweh , the God of Israel , is their inheritance , as he spoke to them .
these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , Joshua the son of nun , and the heads of the fathers ' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel , distributed to them ,
by the lot of their inheritance , as Yahweh commanded by Moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half @-@ tribe .
for Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half @-@ tribe beyond the Jordan ; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them .
the children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses , and they divided the land .
I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land . I brought him word again as it was in my heart .
nevertheless , my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt ; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God .
" now , behold , Yahweh has kept me alive , as he spoke , these forty @-@ five years , from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses , while Israel walked in the wilderness . now , behold , I am eighty @-@ five years old , today .
as yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now for war , to go out and to come in .
therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day ; because he wholly followed Yahweh , the God of Israel .
now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba , after the greatest man among the Anakim . the land had rest from war .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom , even to the wilderness of Zin southward , at the uttermost part of the south .
their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea , from the bay that looks southward ;
and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea , and passed along by Hezron , went up to Addar , and turned about to Karka ;
and it passed along to Azmon , went out at the Brook of Egypt ; and the border ended at the sea . this shall be your south border .
the east border was the Salt Sea , even to the end of the Jordan . the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan .
the border went up to Beth Hoglah , and passed along by the north of Beth Arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben .
the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor , and so northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is over against the ascent of Adummim , which is on the south side of the river . the border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh , and ended at En Rogel .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron ; and the border extended to Baalah ( the same is Kiriath Jearim ) ;
and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir , and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north ( the same is Chesalon ) , and went down to Beth Shemesh , and passed along by Timnah ;
and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward ; and the border extended to Shikkeron , and passed along to Mount Baalah , and went out at Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
the west border was to the shore of the great sea . this is the border of the children of Judah according to their families .
to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah , according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua , even Kiriath Arba , named after the father of Anak ( the same is Hebron ) .
Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak : Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai , the children of Anak .
he went up against the inhabitants of Debir : now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher .
Caleb said , " He who strikes Kiriath Sepher , and takes it , to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife . "
Othniel the son of Kenaz , the brother of Caleb , took it : and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife .
it happened , when she came , that she had him ask her father fore a field . she got off of her donkey , and Caleb said , " What do you want ? "
she said , " Give me a blessing . because you have set me in the land of the South , give me also springs of water . " he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families .
the farthest cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel , Eder , Jagur ,
Lebaoth , Shilhim , Ain , and Rimmon . all the cities are twenty @-@ nine , with their villages .
in the lowland , Eshtaol , Zorah , Ashnah ,
Shaaraim , Adithaim and Gederah ( or Gederothaim ) ; fourteen cities with their villages .
Gederoth , Beth Dagon , Naamah , and Makkedah ; sixteen cities with their villages .
Keilah , Achzib , and Mareshah ; nine cities with their villages .
Ekron , with its towns and its villages ;
from Ekron even to the sea , all that were by the side of Ashdod , with their villages .
Ashdod , its towns and its villages ; Gaza , its towns and its villages ; to the Brook of Egypt , and the great sea with its coastline .
in the hill country , Shamir , Jattir , Socoh ,
Goshen , Holon , and Giloh ; eleven cities with their villages .

in the wilderness , Beth Arabah , Middin , Secacah ,
Nibshan , the City of Salt , and En Gedi ; six cities with their villages .
as for the Jebusites , the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah couldn 't drive them out ; but the Jebusites live with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day .
the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho , at the waters of Jericho on the east , even the wilderness , going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel .
it went out from Bethel to Luz , and passed along to the border of the Archites to Ataroth ;
and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites , to the border of Beth Horon the lower , even to Gezer ; and ended at the sea .
the children of Joseph , Manasseh and Ephraim , took their inheritance .
this was the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families . the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth Addar , to Beth Horon the upper .
the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north . the border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh , and passed along it on the east of Janoah .
it went down from Janoah to Ataroth , to Naarah , reached to Jericho , and went out at the Jordan .
from Tappuah the border went along westward to the Brook of Kanah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families ;
together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
they didn 't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer ; but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day , and have become servants to do forced labor .
this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh , for he was the firstborn of Joseph . as for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead , because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
so this was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families : for the children of Abiezer , for the children of Helek , for the children of Asriel , for the children of Shechem , for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida : these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families .
but Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters : Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
ten parts fell to Manasseh , besides the land of Gilead and Bashan , which is beyond the Jordan ;
because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons . the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh .
the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath , which is before Shechem . the border went along to the right hand , to the inhabitants of En Tappuah .
the land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh ; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim .
the border went down to the Brook of Kanah , southward of the Brook . these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh . the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the Brook , and ended at the sea .
southward it was Ephraim 's , and northward it was Manasseh 's , and the sea was his border . they reached to Asher on the north , and to Issachar on the east .
Manasseh had three heights in Issachar , in Asher Beth Shean and its towns , and Ibleam and its towns , and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns , and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns , and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns .
yet the children of Manasseh couldn 't drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and didn 't utterly drive them out .
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh , and set up the tent of Meeting there . the land was subdued before them .
seven tribes remained among the children of Israel , which had not yet divided their inheritance .
appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe . I will send them , and they shall arise , walk through the land , and describe it according to their inheritance ; and they shall come to me .
they shall divide it into seven portions . Judah shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
you shall survey the land into seven parts , and bring the description here to me ; and I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God .
the men went and passed through the land , and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book . they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh .
Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh . there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions .
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north , and went up through the hill country westward . it ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven .
the border passed along from there to Luz , to the side of Luz ( the same is Bethel ) , southward . the border went down to Ataroth Addar , by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Horon the lower .
the border extended , and turned around on the west quarter southward , from the mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward ; and ended at Kiriath Baal ( the same is Kiriath Jearim ) , a city of the children of Judah . this was the west quarter .
the south quarter was from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim . the border went out westward , and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah .
it extended northward , went out at En Shemesh , and went out to Geliloth , which is over against the ascent of Adummim . it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben .
it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward , and went down to the Arabah .
the border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward ; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea , at the south end of the Jordan . this was the south border .
the Jordan was its border on the east quarter . this was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin , by the borders around it , according to their families .
now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho , Beth Hoglah , Emek Keziz ,
Chephar Ammoni , Ophni , and Geba ; twelve cities with their villages .
Zelah , Eleph , the Jebusite ( the same is Jerusalem ) , Gibeath , and Kiriath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .

Beth Lebaoth , and Sharuhen ; thirteen cities with their villages ;

and all the villages that were around these cities to Baalath Beer , Ramah of the South . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families .
out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon ; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them . therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance .
the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families . the border of their inheritance was to Sarid .
their border went up westward , even to Maralah , and reached to Dabbesheth . it reached to the Brook that is before Jokneam .
it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to the border of Chisloth Tabor . it went out to Daberath , and went up to Japhia .
from there it passed along eastward to Gath Hepher , to Ethkazin ; and it went out at Rimmon which stretches to Neah .
the border turned around it on the north to Hannathon ; and it ended at the valley of Iphtah El ;

so they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by its borders . the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of nun in their midst .
according to the commandment of Yahweh , they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim ; and he built the city , and lived there .
Yahweh spoke to Joshua , saying ,
that the manslayer who kills any person accidentally or unintentionally may flee there . they shall be to you for a refuge from the avenger of blood .
if the avenger of blood pursue after him , then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand ; because he struck his neighbor unintentionally , and didn 't hate him before .
they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali , Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and Kiriath Arba ( the same is Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah .
the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance , according to the commandment of Yahweh , these cities with their suburbs .
the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites . the children of Aaron the priest , who were of the Levites , had thirteen cities by lot out of the tribe of Judah , out of the tribe of the Simeonites , and out of the tribe of Benjamin .

they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are mentioned by name :
and they were for the children of Aaron , of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi ; for theirs was the first lot .
they gave them Kiriath Arba , named after the father of Anak ( the same is Hebron ) , in the hill country of Judah , with its suburbs around it .

all the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs .
they gave to the children of Gershon , of the families of the Levites , out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh Golan in Bashan with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and Be Eshterah with its suburbs ; two cities .
out of the tribe of Issachar , Kishion with its suburbs , Daberath with its suburbs ,
out of the tribe of Asher , Mishal with its suburbs , Abdon with its suburbs ,
out of the tribe of Naphtali , Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , Hammothdor with its suburbs , and Kartan with its suburbs ; three cities .
all the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
to the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with its suburbs , Kartah with its suburbs ,
Dimnah with its suburbs , and Nahalal with its suburbs ; four cities .
out of the tribe of Reuben , Bezer with its suburbs , Jahaz with its suburbs ,
out of the tribe of Gad , Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and Mahanaim with its suburbs ,
all these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families , even the rest of the families of the Levites . their lot was twelve cities .
all the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty @-@ eight cities with their suburbs .
each of these cities included their suburbs around them . it was this way with all these cities .
so Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers . they possessed it , and lived in it .
Yahweh gave them rest all around , according to all that he swore to their fathers . not a man of all their enemies stood before them . Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand .
nothing failed of any good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel . all came to pass .
then Joshua called the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh ,
and said to them , " You have kept all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you , and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you .
you have not left your brothers these many days to this day , but have performed the duty of the commandment of Yahweh your God .
so Joshua blessed them , and sent them away ; and they went to their tents .
now to the one half @-@ tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan ; but to the other half gave Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward . moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents , he blessed them ,
when they came to the region about the Jordan , that is in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan , a great altar to look at .
the children of Israel heard this , " behold , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan , in the region about the Jordan , on the side that pertains to the children of Israel . "
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up against them to war .
the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
and with him ten princes , one prince of a fathers ' house for each of the tribes of Israel ; and they were everyone of them head of their fathers ' houses among the thousands of Israel .
they came to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , to the land of Gilead , and they spoke with them , saying ,
" thus says the whole Congregation of Yahweh , ' What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following Yahweh , in that you have built yourselves an altar , to rebel this day against Yahweh ?
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day , although there came a plague on the Congregation of Yahweh ,
that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh ? it will be , since you rebel today against Yahweh , that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole Congregation of Israel .
Didn 't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing , and wrath fell on all the Congregation of Israel ? that man didn 't perish alone in his iniquity . ' "
then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh answered , and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh ; or if to offer burnt offering or meal offering , or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings , let Yahweh himself require it .
" if we have not out of concern done this , and for a reason , saying , ' In time to come your children might speak to our children , saying , " What have you to do with Yahweh , the God of Israel ?
for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you , you children of Reuben and children of Gad . you have no portion in Yahweh . " ' so your children might make our children cease from fearing Yahweh .
" therefore we said , ' Let 's now prepare to build ourselves an altar , not for burnt offering , nor for sacrifice ;
when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the Congregation , even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke , it pleased them well .
Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , to the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
it happened after many days , when Yahweh had given rest to Israel from their enemies all around , and Joshua was old and well advanced in years ,
that Joshua called for all Israel , for their elders and for their heads , and for their judges and for their officers , and said to them , " I am old and well advanced in years .
you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations because of you ; for it is Yahweh your God who has fought for you .
Yahweh your God will thrust them out from before you , and drive them from out of your sight . you shall possess their land , as Yahweh your God spoke to you .
" therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses , that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left ;
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
but hold fast to Yahweh your God , as you have done to this day .
" for Yahweh has driven great and strong nations out from before you . but as for you , no man has stood before you to this day .
one man of you shall chase a thousand ; for it is Yahweh your God who fights for you , as he spoke to you .
take good heed therefore to yourselves , that you love Yahweh your God .
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , for their heads , for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
I took your father Abraham from beyond the River , and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gave him Isaac .
I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau : and I gave to Esau Mount Seir , to possess it . Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
" ' I sent Moses and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did in its midst : and afterward I brought you out .
I brought your fathers out of Egypt : and you came to the sea . the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea .
when they cried out to Yahweh , he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea on them , and covered them ; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt : and you lived in the wilderness many days .
" ' I brought you into the land of the Amorites , that lived beyond the Jordan : and they fought with you ; and I gave them into your hand . you possessed their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
then Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , arose and fought against Israel . he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you ;
but I would not listen to Balaam ; therefore he blessed you still . so I delivered you out of his hand .
" ' you went over the Jordan , and came to Jericho . the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorite , the Perizzite , the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Girgashite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite ; and I delivered them into your hand .
I sent the hornet before you , which drove them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; not with your sword , nor with your bow .
the people answered , " Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh , to serve other gods ;
Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples , even the Amorites who lived in the land . therefore we also will serve Yahweh ; for he is our God . "
Joshua said to the people , " You can 't serve Yahweh ; for he is a holy God . he is a Jealous God . he will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins .
if you forsake Yahweh , and serve foreign gods , then he will turn and do you evil , and consume you , after he has done you good . "
the people said to Joshua , " No ; but we will serve Yahweh . "
Joshua said to the people , " You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Yahweh yourselves , to serve him . " they said , " We are witnesses . "
" now therefore put away the foreign gods which are among you , and incline your heart to Yahweh , the God of Israel . "
the people said to Joshua , " We will serve Yahweh our God , and we will listen to his voice . "
so Joshua made a Covenant with the people that day , and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem .
Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God ; and he took a great stone , and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh .
Joshua said to all the people , " behold , this stone shall be a witness against us ; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh which he spoke to us . it shall be therefore a witness against you , lest you deny your God . "
so Joshua sent the people away , every man to his inheritance .
it happened after these things , that Joshua the son of nun , the servant of Yahweh , died , being one hundred and ten years old .
they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah , which is in the hill country of Ephraim , on the north of the mountain of Gaash .
Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , and had known all the work of Yahweh , that he had worked for Israel .
Eleazar the son of Aaron died . they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son , which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim .
it happened after the death of Joshua , the children of Israel asked of Yahweh , saying , " Who should go up for us first against the Canaanites , to fight against them ? "
Yahweh said , " Judah shall go up . behold , I have delivered the land into his hand . "
Judah went up ; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand : and they struck of them in Bezek ten thousand men .
they found Adoni @-@ Bezek in Bezek ; and they fought against him , and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
but Adoni @-@ Bezek fled ; and they pursued after him , and caught him , and cut off his thumbs and his great toes .
the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem , and took it , and struck it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country , and in the South , and in the lowland .
Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron ( now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba ) ; and they struck Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai .
from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir . ( now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher . )
Caleb said , " He who strikes Kiriath Sepher , and takes it , to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife . "
Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother , took it : and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife .
it happened , when she came , that she got him to ask her father for a field : and she alighted from off her donkey ; and Caleb said to her , " What would you like ? "
she said to him , " Give me a blessing ; for that you have set me in the land of the South , give me also springs of water . " then Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
the children of the Kenite , Moses ' brother @-@ in @-@ law , went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah , which is in the south of Arad ; and they went and lived with the people .
Judah went with Simeon his brother , and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath , and utterly destroyed it . the name of the city was called Hormah .
also Judah took Gaza with its border , and Ashkelon with its border , and Ekron with its border .
Yahweh was with Judah ; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
they gave Hebron to Caleb , as Moses had spoken : and he drove out there the three sons of Anak .
the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem ; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day .
the house of Joseph , they also went up against Bethel ; and Yahweh was with them .
he showed them the entrance into the city ; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let the man go and all his family .
the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called its name Luz , which is its name to this day .
Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns , nor Taanach and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
it happened , when Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and did not utterly drive them out .
Ephraim didn 't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer ; but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them .
Zebulun didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites lived among them , and became subject to forced labor .
Asher didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Acco , nor the inhabitants of Sidon , nor of Ahlab , nor of Achzib , nor of Helbah , nor of Aphik , nor of Rehob ;
but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
Naphtali didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh , nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath ; but he lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor .
the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country ; for they would not allow them to come down to the valley ;
but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres , in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became subject to forced labor .
the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim , from the rock , and upward .
the angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim . he said , " I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers ; and I said , ' I will never break my Covenant with you :
and you shall make no Covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; you shall break down their altars . ' but you have not listened to my voice : why have you done this ?
therefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare to you . "
it happened , when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
they called the name of that place Bochim : and they sacrificed there to Yahweh .
now when Joshua had sent the people away , the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land .
the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel .
Joshua the son of nun , the servant of Yahweh , died , being one hundred ten years old .
they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres , in the hill country of Ephraim , on the north of the mountain of Gaash .
also all that generation were gathered to their fathers : and there arose another generation after them , who didn 't know Yahweh , nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and served the Baals ;
and they forsook Yahweh , the God of their fathers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the peoples who were around them , and bowed themselves down to them : and they provoked Yahweh to anger .
they forsook Yahweh , and served Baal and the Ashtaroth .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them ; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all around , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
wherever they went out , the hand of Yahweh was against them for evil , as Yahweh had spoken , and as Yahweh had sworn to them : and they were very distressed .
Yahweh raised up judges , who saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them .
yet they didn 't listen to their judges ; for they played the prostitute after other gods , and bowed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked , obeying the commandments of Yahweh . they didn 't do so .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel ; and he said , " Because this nation have transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers , and have not listened to my voice ;
I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died ;
that by them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk therein , as their fathers kept it , or not . "
so Yahweh left those nations , without driving them out hastily ; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua .
now these are the nations which Yahweh left , to prove Israel by them , even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan ;
the five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon , from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath .
they were left to test Israel by them , to know whether they would listen to the commandments of Yahweh , which he commanded their fathers by Moses .
the children of Israel lived among the Canaanites , the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites :
and they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and forgot Yahweh their God , and served the Baals and the Asheroth .
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia : and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years .
when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised up a Savior to the children of Israel , who saved them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
the land had rest forty years . Othniel the son of Kenaz died .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek ; and he went and struck Israel , and they possessed the city of palm trees .
the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab Eighteen years .
but when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised them up a Savior , Ehud the son of Gera , the Benjamite , a man left @-@ handed . the children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab .
Ehud made him a sword which had two edges , a cubit in length ; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh .
he offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab : now Eglon was a very fat man .
when he had made an end of offering the tribute , he sent away the people who bore the tribute .
Ehud came to him ; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room . Ehud said , " I have a message from God to you . " he arose out of his seat .
Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the sword from his right thigh , and thrust it into his body :
and the handle also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed on the blade , for he didn 't draw the sword out of his body ; and it came out behind .
then Ehud went forth into the porch , and shut the doors of the upper room on him , and locked them .
now when he was gone out , his servants came ; and they saw , and behold , the doors of the upper room were locked ; and they said , " surely he is covering his feet in the upper room . "
they waited until they were ashamed ; and behold , he didn 't open the doors of the upper room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
Ehud escaped while they waited , and passed beyond the quarries , and escaped to Seirah .
it happened , when he had come , that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim ; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he before them .
they struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , every lusty man , and every man of valor ; and there escaped not a man .
so Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel . the land had rest eighty years .
after him was Shamgar the son of Anath , who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad : and he also saved Israel .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , when Ehud was dead .
Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan , who reigned in Hazor ; the captain of whose army was Sisera , who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles .
the children of Israel cried to Yahweh : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron ; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel .
now Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lappidoth , she judged Israel at that time .
she lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
I will draw to you , to the river Kishon , Sisera , the captain of Jabin 's army , with his chariots and his multitude ; and I will deliver him into your hand . ' "
Barak said to her , " If you will go with me , then I will go ; but if you will not go with me , I will not go . "
Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh ; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet : and Deborah went up with him .
now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites , even from the children of Hobab the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Moses , and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim , which is by Kedesh .
they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor .
Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles , to the river Kishon .
Yahweh confused Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his army , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; and Sisera alighted from his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
but Barak pursued after the chariots , and after the army , to Harosheth of the Gentiles : and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword ; there was not a man left .
however Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite ; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said to him , " Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; don 't be afraid . " he came in to her into the tent , and she covered him with a rug .
he said to her , " Please give me a little water to drink ; for I am thirsty . " she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
he said to her , " Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man comes and inquires of you , and says , ' Is there any man here ? ' that you shall say , ' No . ' "
so God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel .
the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day , saying ,
" because the leaders took the lead in Israel , because the people offered themselves willingly , be blessed , Yahweh !
" hear , you kings ! give ear , you princes ! I , even I , will sing to Yahweh . I will sing praise to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
" Yahweh , when you went forth out of Seir , when you marched out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , the sky also dropped . yes , the clouds dropped water .
the mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh , even Sinai , at the presence of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
" in the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were unoccupied . the travelers walked through byways .
the rulers ceased in Israel . they ceased until I , Deborah , arose ; Until I arose a mother in Israel .
they chose new gods . then war was in the gates . was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel ?
my heart is toward the governors of Israel , who offered themselves willingly among the people . bless Yahweh !
" speak , you who ride on white donkeys , you who sit on rich carpets , and you who walk by the way .
far from the noise of archers , in the places of drawing water , there they will rehearse the righteous acts of Yahweh , the righteous acts of his rule in Israel . " then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates .
'Awake , awake , Deborah ! awake , awake , utter a song ! arise , Barak , and lead away your captives , you son of Abinoam . '
" then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down . Yahweh came down for me against the mighty .
those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim , after you , Benjamin , among your peoples . governors come down out of Machir . those who handle the marshal 's staff came out of Zebulun .
the princes of Issachar were with Deborah . as was Issachar , so was Barak . they rushed into the valley at his feet . by the watercourses of Reuben , there were great resolves of heart .
why did you sit among the sheepfolds , To hear the whistling for the flocks ? at the watercourses of Reuben There were great searchings of heart .
Gilead lived beyond the Jordan . why did Dan remain in ships ? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea , and lived by his creeks .
Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths ; Naphtali also , on the high places of the field .
" the kings came and fought , then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo . they took no plunder of silver .
from the sky the stars fought . from their courses , they fought against Sisera .
the river Kishon swept them away , that ancient river , the river Kishon . my soul , march on with strength .
then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancings , the prancings of their strong ones .
'Curse Meroz , ' said the angel of Yahweh . ' curse bitterly its inhabitants , because they didn 't come to help Yahweh , to help Yahweh against the mighty . '
" Jael shall be blessed above women , the wife of Heber the Kenite ; blessed shall she be above women in the tent .
he asked for water . she gave him milk . she brought him butter in a lordly dish .
she put her hand to the tent peg , and her right hand to the workmen 's hammer . with the hammer she struck Sisera . she struck through his head . yes , she pierced and struck through his temples .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay . at her feet he bowed , he fell . where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
" through the window she looked out , and cried : Sisera 's mother looked through the lattice . ' why is his chariot so long in coming ? why do the wheels of his chariots wait ? '
her wise ladies answered her , Yes , she returned answer to herself ,
" so let all your enemies perish , Yahweh , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest forty years .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years .
the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel ; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and the caves , and the strongholds .
so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east ; they came up against them ;
and they encamped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , until you come to Gaza , and left no sustenance in Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor donkey .
for they came up with their livestock and their tents ; they came in as locusts for multitude ; both they and their camels were without number : and they came into the land to destroy it .
Israel was brought very low because of Midian ; and the children of Israel cried to Yahweh .
it happened , when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian ,
that Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel : and he said to them , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all who oppressed you , and drove them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and I said to you , " I am Yahweh your God ; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you dwell . " but you have not listened to my voice . ' "
the angel of Yahweh came , and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite : and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
the angel of Yahweh appeared to him , and said to him , " Yahweh is with you , you mighty man of valor ! "
Yahweh looked at him , and said , " Go in this your might , and save Israel from the hand of Midian . haven 't I sent you ? "
Yahweh said to him , " surely I will be with you , and you shall strike the Midianites as one man . "
he said to him , " If now I have found favor in your sight , then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me .
please don 't go away , until I come to you , and bring out my present , and lay it before you . " he said , " I will wait until you come back . "
Gideon went in , and prepared a young goat , and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal . he put the meat in a basket and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out to him under the oak , and presented it .
the angel of God said to him , " Take the meat and the unleavened cakes , and lay them on this rock , and pour out the broth . " he did so .
Gideon saw that he was the angel of Yahweh ; and Gideon said , " Alas , Lord Yahweh ! because I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face ! "
Yahweh said to him , " Peace be to you ! Don 't be afraid . you shall not die . "
then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh , and called it " Yahweh is Peace . " to this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold , in an orderly way , and take the second bull , and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down . "
then Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as Yahweh had spoken to him : and it happened , because he feared his father 's household and the men of the city , so that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was broken down , and the Asherah was cut down that was by it , and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built .
they said one to another , " Who has done this thing ? " when they inquired and asked , they said , " Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing . "
then the men of the city said to Joash , " Bring out your son , that he may die , because he has broken down the altar of Baal , and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it . "
therefore on that day he named him Jerub @-@ Baal , saying , " Let Baal contend against him , because he has broken down his altar . "
then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together ; and they passed over , and encamped in the valley of Jezreel .
but the Spirit of Yahweh came on Gideon ; and he blew a trumpet ; and Abiezer was gathered together after him .
he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; and they also were gathered together after him : and he sent messengers to Asher , and to Zebulun , and to Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
Gideon said to God , " If you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken ,
behold , I will put a Fleece of wool on the threshing floor ; if there is dew on the Fleece only , and it is dry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
it was so ; for he rose up early on the next day , and pressed the Fleece together , and wrung the dew out of the Fleece , a bowl full of water .
God did so that night : for it was dry on the Fleece only , and there was dew on all the ground .
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and encamped beside the spring of Harod : and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Yahweh said to Gideon , " Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue , like a dog laps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink . "
the number of those who lapped , putting their hand to their mouth , was three hundred men ; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water .
Yahweh said to Gideon , " By the three hundred men who lapped will I save you , and deliver the Midianites into your hand . let all the other people go , each to his own place . "
it happened the same night , that Yahweh said to him , " arise , go down into the camp ; for I have delivered it into your hand .
but if you are afraid to go down , go with Purah your servant down to the camp :
and you shall hear what they say ; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp . " then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp .
the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude .
his fellow answered , " This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash , a man of Israel . God has delivered Midian into his hand , with all the army . "
it was so , when Gideon heard the telling of the dream , and its interpretation , that he worshiped ; and he returned into the camp of Israel , and said , " arise ; for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian into your hand ! "
he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets , and empty pitchers , with torches within the pitchers .
he said to them , " Watch me , and do likewise . behold , when I come to the outermost part of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so you shall do .
when I blow the trumpet , I and all who are with me , then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp , and shout , ' For Yahweh and for Gideon ! ' "
they each stood in his place around the camp ; and all the army ran ; and they shouted , and put them to flight .
the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after Midian .
the men of Ephraim said to him , " Why have you treated us this way , that you didn 't call us , when you went to fight with Midian ? " they rebuked him sharply .
God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb ! what was I able to do in comparison with you ? " then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
Gideon came to the Jordan , and passed over , he , and the three hundred men who were with him , faint , yet pursuing .
he said to the men of Succoth , " Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me ; for they are faint , and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian . "
the princes of Succoth said , " Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand , that we should give bread to your army ? "
Gideon said , " Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand , then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers . "
he went up there to Penuel , and spoke to them in the same way ; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered .
he spoke also to the men of Penuel , saying , " When I come again in peace , I will break down this tower . "
now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their armies with them , about fifteen thousand men , all who were left of all the army of the children of the east ; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword .
Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and struck the army ; for the army was secure .
Zebah and Zalmunna fled ; and he pursued after them ; and he took the two kings of Midian , Zebah and Zalmunna , and confused all the army .
Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres .
he caught a young man of the men of Succoth , and inquired of him : and he described for him the princes of Succoth , and its elders , seventy @-@ seven men .
he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he taught the men of Succoth .
he broke down the tower of Penuel , and killed the men of the city .
then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna , " What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor ? " they answered , " They were like you . each one resembled the children of a king . "
he said , " They were my brothers , the sons of my mother . as Yahweh lives , if you had saved them alive , I would not kill you . "
he said to Jether his firstborn , " Get up , and kill them ! " but the youth didn 't draw his sword ; for he was afraid , because he was yet a youth .
then the men of Israel said to Gideon , " Rule over us , both you , and your son , and your son 's son also ; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian . "
Gideon said to them , " I will not rule over you , neither shall my son rule over you . Yahweh shall rule over you . "
Gideon said to them , " I would make a request of you , that you would give me every man the earrings of his spoil . " ( for they had golden earrings , because they were Ishmaelites . )
they answered , " We will willingly give them . " they spread a garment , and every man threw the earrings of his spoil into it .
so Midian was subdued before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon .
Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house .
Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body ; for he had many wives .
his concubine who was in Shechem , she also bore him a son , and he named him Abimelech .
Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
it happened , as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and played the prostitute after the Baals , and made Baal Berith their god .
the children of Israel didn 't remember Yahweh their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side ;
neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal , Gideon , according to all the Goodness which he had shown to Israel .
Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
his mother 's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , " He is our brother . "
they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith , with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows , who followed him .
he went to his father 's house at Ophrah , and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal , being seventy persons , on one stone : but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together , and all the house of Millo , and went and made Abimelech king , by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem .
when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said to them , " listen to me , you men of Shechem , that God may listen to you .
the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them ; and they said to the olive tree , ' reign over us . '
" but the olive tree said to them , ' Should I leave my fatness , with which by me they honor God and man , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
" the trees said to the fig tree , ' Come and reign over us . '
" but the fig tree said to them , ' Should I leave my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
" the trees said to the vine , ' Come and reign over us . '
" the vine said to them , ' Should I leave my new wine , which cheers God and man , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
" then all the trees said to the bramble , ' Come and reign over us . '
( for my father fought for you , and risked his life , and delivered you out of the hand of Midian :
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , seventy persons , on one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his female servant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ) ;
if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then rejoice in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you :
but if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and devour the men of Shechem , and the house of Millo ; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem , and from the house of Millo , and devour Abimelech . "
Jotham ran away , and fled , and went to Beer , and lived there , for fear of Abimelech his brother .
God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech :
the men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers , and went over to Shechem ; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him .
they went out into the field , and harvested their vineyards , and trod the grapes , and held festival , and went into the house of their god , and ate and drank , and Cursed Abimelech .
would that this people were under my hand ! then I would remove Abimelech . " he said to Abimelech , " Increase your army , and come out ! "
when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , his anger was kindled .
he sent messengers to Abimelech craftily , saying , " behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem ; and behold , they incite the city against you .
now therefore , go up by night , you and the people who are with you , and lie in wait in the field :
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , you shall rise early , and rush on the city ; and behold , when he and the people who are with him come out against you , then may you do to them as you shall find occasion . "
Abimelech rose up , and all the people who were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies .
Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people who were with him , from the ambush .
when Gaal saw the people , he said to Zebul , " behold , people are coming down from the tops of the mountains . " Zebul said to him , " You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men . "
Gaal spoke again and said , " behold , people are coming down by the middle of the land , and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim . "
Gaal went out before the men of Shechem , and fought with Abimelech .
Abimelech chased him , and he fled before him , and many fell wounded , even to the entrance of the gate .
Abimelech lived at Arumah : and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers , that they should not dwell in Shechem .
it happened on the next day , that the people went out into the field ; and they told Abimelech .
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and behold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
Abimelech , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and killed the people who were therein : and he beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it , they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith .
it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together .
all the people likewise each cut down his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them at the base of the stronghold , and set the stronghold on fire on them ; so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
then went Abimelech to Thebez , and encamped against Thebez , and took it .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and there fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut themselves in , and went up to the roof of the tower .
Abimelech came to the tower , and fought against it , and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
a certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech 's head , and broke his skull .
when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , they departed every man to his place .
thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech , which he did to his father , in killing his seventy brothers ;
and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite on their heads : and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .
after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah , the son of Dodo , a man of Issachar ; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim .
he judged Israel twenty @-@ three years , and died , and was buried in Shamir .
after him arose Jair , the Gileadite ; and he judged Israel twenty @-@ two years .
he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts , and they had thirty cities , which are called Havvoth Jair to this day , which are in the land of Gilead .
Jair died , and was buried in Kamon .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and served the Baals , and the Ashtaroth , and the gods of Syria , and the gods of Sidon , and the gods of Moab , and the gods of the children of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines ; and they forsook Yahweh , and didn 't serve him .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the children of Ammon .
the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was very distressed .
the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , saying , " We have sinned against you , even because we have forsaken our God , and have served the Baals . "
Yahweh said to the children of Israel , " Didn 't I save you from the Egyptians , and from the Amorites , from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines ?
the Sidonians also , and the Amalekites , and the Maonites , oppressed you ; and you cried to me , and I saved you out of their hand .
yet you have forsaken me , and served other gods : therefore I will save you no more .
go and cry to the gods which you have chosen . let them save you in the time of your distress ! "
the children of Israel said to Yahweh , " We have sinned : do you to us whatever seems good to you ; only deliver us , please , this day . "
they put away the foreign gods from among them , and served Yahweh ; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
then the children of Ammon were gathered together , and encamped in Gilead . the children of Israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in Mizpah .
the people , the princes of Gilead , said one to another , " What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . "
now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor , and he was the son of a prostitute : and Gilead became the father of Jephthah .
then Jephthah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah , and they went out with him .
it happened after a while , that the children of Ammon made war against Israel .
it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob ;
and they said to Jephthah , " Come and be our chief , that we may fight with the children of Ammon . "
Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , " Didn 't you hate me , and drive me out of my father 's house ? why have you come to me now when you are in distress ? "
the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , " Therefore we have turned again to you now , that you may go with us , and fight with the children of Ammon ; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . "
Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , " If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon , and Yahweh deliver them before me , shall I be your head ? "
the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , " Yahweh shall be witness between us ; surely according to your word so will we do . "
then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and chief over them : and Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in Mizpah .
Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon ;
and he said to him , " Thus says Jephthah : Israel didn 't take away the land of Moab , nor the land of the children of Ammon ,
but when they came up from Egypt , and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea , and came to Kadesh ;
Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon ; and Israel said to him , ' Please let us pass through your land to my place . '
but Sihon didn 't trust Israel to pass through his border ; but Sihon gathered all his people together , and encamped in Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
Yahweh , the God of Israel , delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they struck them : so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites , the inhabitants of that country .
they possessed all the border of the Amorites , from the Arnon even to the Jabbok , and from the wilderness even to the Jordan .
so now Yahweh , the God of Israel , has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel , and should you possess them ?
won 't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess ? so whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us , them will we possess .
now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ?
while Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns , and in Aroer and its towns , and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon , three hundred years ; why didn 't you recover them within that time ?
I therefore have not sinned against you , but you do me wrong to war against me . Yahweh , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon . "
however the king of the children of Ammon didn 't listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him .
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon .
Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh , and said , " If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand ,
then it shall be , that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , it shall be Yahweh 's , and I will offer it up for a burnt offering . "
so Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them ; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand .
he struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith , even twenty cities , and to Abelcheramim , with a very great slaughter . so the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel .
Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house ; and behold , his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances : and she was his only child ; besides her he had neither son nor daughter .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my companions . "
he said , " Go . " he sent her away for two months : and she departed , she and her companions , and mourned her virginity on the mountains .
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she was a virgin . it was a custom in Israel ,
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year .
the men of Ephraim were gathered together , and passed northward ; and they said to Jephthah , " Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon , and didn 't call us to go with you ? we will burn your house around you with fire ! "
Jephthah said to them , " I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon ; and when I called you , you didn 't save me out of their hand .
when I saw that you didn 't save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and Yahweh delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
Jephthah judged Israel six years . then Jephthah the Gileadite died , and was buried in the cities of Gilead .
after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel .
he had thirty sons ; and thirty daughters he sent abroad , and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons . he judged Israel seven years .
Ibzan died , and was buried at Bethlehem .
after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel ; and he judged Israel ten years .
Elon the Zebulunite died , and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun .
after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel .
he had forty sons and thirty sons ' sons , who rode on seventy donkey colts : and he judged Israel eight years .
Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the hill country of the Amalekites .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years .
there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and didn 't bear .
the angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman , and said to her , " See now , you are barren , and don 't bear ; but you shall conceive , and bear a son .
now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink , and don 't eat any unclean thing :
for , behold , you shall conceive , and bear a son ; and no razor shall come on his head ; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb : and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines . "
then Manoah entreated Yahweh , and said , " Oh , Lord , please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us , and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born . "
God listened to the voice of Manoah ; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field : but Manoah , her husband , wasn 't with her .
the woman made haste , and ran , and told her husband , and said to him , " behold , the man has appeared to me , who came to me that day . "
Manoah arose , and went after his wife , and came to the man , and said to him , " Are you the man who spoke to the woman ? " he said , " I am . "
Manoah said , " Now let your words happen . what shall the child 's way of life and mission be ? "
the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah , " Of all that I said to the woman let her beware .
she may not eat of anything that comes of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing ; all that I commanded her let her observe . "
Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh , " Please , let us detain you , that we may make a young goat ready for you . "
the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah , " Though you detain me , I won 't eat of your bread ; and if you will prepare a burnt offering , you must offer it to Yahweh . " for Manoah didn 't know that he was the angel of Yahweh .
Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh , " What is your name , that when your words happen , we may honor you ? "
the angel of Yahweh said to him , " Why do you ask about my name , since it is wonderful ? "
so Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering , and offered it on the rock to Yahweh . then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on .
for it happened , when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar , that the angel of Yahweh ascended in the flame of the altar : and Manoah and his wife looked on ; and they fell on their faces to the ground .
but the angel of Yahweh didn 't appear to Manoah or to his wife any more . then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh .
Manoah said to his wife , " We shall surely die , because we have seen God . "
the woman bore a son , and named him Samson : and the child grew , and Yahweh blessed him .
the Spirit of Yahweh began to move him in Mahaneh Dan , between Zorah and Eshtaol .
Samson went down to Timnah , and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines .
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
but his father and his mother didn 't know that it was of Yahweh ; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines . now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel .
then went Samson down , and his father and his mother , to Timnah , and came to the vineyards of Timnah : and behold , a young lion roared against him .
the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him , and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat ; and he had nothing in his hand : but he didn 't tell his father or his mother what he had done .
he went down , and talked with the woman , and she pleased Samson well .
after a while he returned to take her ; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion : and behold , there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion , and honey .
his father went down to the woman : and Samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
it happened , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
he said to them , " Out of the eater came forth food . out of the strong came forth sweetness . " they couldn 't in three days declare the riddle .
but Samson 's wife was given to his companion , whom he had used as his friend .
her father said , " I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated her ; therefore I gave her to your companion . Isn 't her younger sister more beautiful than she ? please take her , instead . "
Samson said to them , " This time I will be blameless in regard of the Philistines , when I harm them . "
Samson went and caught three hundred foxes , and took torches , and turned tail to tail , and put a torch in the midst between every two tails .
when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines , and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain , and also the olive groves .
Samson said to them , " If you behave like this , surely I will be avenged of you , and after that I will cease . "
he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam .
then the Philistines went up , and encamped in Judah , and spread themselves in Lehi .
they said to him , " We have come down to bind you , that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines . " Samson said to them , " swear to me that you will not fall on me yourselves . "
he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men therewith .
Samson said , " With the jawbone of a donkey , heaps on heaps ; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men . "
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand ; and that place was called Ramath Lehi .
he was very thirsty , and called on Yahweh , and said , " You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant ; and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ? "
he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years .
Samson went to Gaza , and saw there a prostitute , and went in to her .
it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
Delilah said to Samson , " Please tell me where your great strength lies , and what you might be bound to afflict you . "
Samson said to her , " If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
Delilah said to Samson , " behold , you have mocked me , and told me lies : now please tell me with which you might be bound . "
he said to her , " If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
she said to him , " How can you say , ' I love you , ' when your heart is not with me ? you have mocked me these three times , and have not told me where your great strength lies . "
it happened , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , that his soul was troubled to death .
she said , " The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! " he awoke out of his sleep , and said , " I will go out as at other times , and shake myself free . " but he didn 't know that Yahweh had departed from him .
the Philistines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
however the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved .
the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god , and to rejoice ; for they said , " Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand . "
when the people saw him , they praised their god ; for they said , " Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country , who has slain many of us , into our hand . "
it happened , when their hearts were merry , that they said , " Call for Samson , that he may entertain us . " they called for Samson out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pillars ;
and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand , " allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house rests , that I may lean on them . "
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women , who saw while Samson performed .
Samson called to Yahweh , and said , " Lord Yahweh , remember me , please , and strengthen me , please , only this once , God , that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes . "
Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested , and leaned on them , the one with his right hand , and the other with his left .
there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim , whose name was Micah .
when he restored the money to his mother , his mother took two hundred pieces of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made of it an engraved image and a molten image : and it was in the house of Micah .
the man Micah had a house of gods , and he made an ephod , and teraphim , and consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest .
in those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
there was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah , of the family of Judah , who was a Levite ; and he lived there .
the man departed out of the city , out of Bethlehem Judah , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he traveled .
Micah said to him , " Where did you come from ? " he said to him , " I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah , and I am looking for a place to live . "
the Levite was content to dwell with the man ; and the young man was to him as one of his sons .
Micah consecrated the Levite , and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of Micah .
then Micah said , " Now know I that Yahweh will do good to me , since I have a Levite to my priest . "
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in ; for to that day , their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel .
he said to them , " Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me , and he has hired me , and I am become his priest . "
they said to him , " Please ask counsel of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous . "
the priest said to them , " Go in peace . your way in which you go is before Yahweh . "
they came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol : and their brothers said to them , " What do you say ? "
they said , " arise , and let us go up against them ; for we have seen the land , and behold , it is very good . do you stand still ? Don 't be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land .
there set forth from there of the family of the Danites , out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol , six hundred men girt with weapons of war .
they went up , and encamped in Kiriath Jearim , in Judah : therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan , to this day ; behold , it is behind Kiriath Jearim .
they passed there to the hill country of Ephraim , and came to the house of Micah .
they turned aside there , and came to the house of the young man the Levite , even to the house of Micah , and asked him of his welfare .
the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
when these went into Micah 's house , and fetched the engraved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image , the priest said to them , " What are you doing ? "
the priest 's heart was glad , and he took the ephod , and the teraphim , and the engraved image , and went in the midst of the people .
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them .
when they were a good way from the house of Micah , the men who were in the houses near to Micah 's house were gathered together , and overtook the children of Dan .
they cried to the children of Dan . they turned their faces , and said to Micah , " What ails you , that you come with such a company ? "
he said , " You have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and have gone away , and what more do I have ? how then do you say to me , ' What ails you ? ' "
the children of Dan said to him , " Don 't let your voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows fall on you , and you lose your life , with the lives of your household . "
the children of Dan went their way : and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his house .
they took that which Micah had made , and the priest whom he had , and came to Laish , to a people quiet and secure , and struck them with the edge of the sword ; and they burnt the city with fire .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was Laish at the first .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land .
it happened in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Levite living on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim , who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah .
his father @-@ in @-@ law , the young lady 's father , retained him ; and he stayed with him three days : so they ate and drink , and lodged there .
it happened on the fourth day , that they arose early in the morning , and he rose up to depart : and the young lady 's father said to his son @-@ in @-@ law , " Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward you shall go your way . "
so they sat down , ate , and drank , both of them together : and the young lady 's father said to the man , " Please be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be merry . "
the man rose up to depart ; but his father @-@ in @-@ law urged him , and he lodged there again .
he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart ; and the young lady 's father said , " Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines " ; and they both ate .
but the man wouldn 't stay that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus ( the same is Jerusalem ) : and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled ; his concubine also was with him .
when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said to his master , " Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it . "
his master said to him , " We won 't turn aside into the city of a foreigner , that is not of the children of Israel ; but we will pass over to Gibeah . "
he said to his servant , " Come and let us draw near to one of these places ; and we will lodge in Gibeah , or in Ramah . "
so they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down on them near to Gibeah , which belongs to Benjamin .
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gibeah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim , and he lived in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjamites .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city ; and the old man said , " Where are you going ? where did you come from ? "
yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for your handmaid , and for the young man who is with your servants : there is no want of anything . "
the old man said , " Peace be to you ; howsoever let all your wants lie on me ; only don 't lodge in the street . "
so he brought him into his house , and gave the donkeys fodder ; and they washed their feet , and ate and drink .
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , until it was light .
her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
he said to her , " Get up , and let us be going ! " but no one answered . then he took her up on the donkey ; and the man rose up , and went to his place .
when he had come into his house , he took a knife , and laid hold on his concubine , and divided her , limb by limb , into twelve pieces , and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the Congregation was assembled as one man , from Dan even to Beersheba , with the land of Gilead , to Yahweh at Mizpah .
the chiefs of all the people , even of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . ) The children of Israel said , " Tell us , how did this wickedness happen ? "
the Levite , the husband of the woman who was murdered , answered , " I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin , I and my concubine , to lodge .
the men of Gibeah rose against me , and surrounded the house by night . they thought to have slain me , and they forced my concubine , and she is dead .
I took my concubine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel ; for they have committed lewdness and Folly in Israel .
behold , you children of Israel , all of you , give here your advice and counsel . "
all the people arose as one man , saying , " None of us will go to his tent , neither will any of us turn to his house .
but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah : we will go up against it by lot ;
so all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , " What wickedness is this that is happen among you ?
now therefore deliver up the men , the base fellows , who are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel . " but Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel .
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left @-@ handed ; everyone could sling stones at a hair @-@ breadth , and not miss .
the men of Israel , besides Benjamin , were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword : all these were men of war .
the children of Israel arose , and went up to Bethel , and asked counsel of God ; and they said , " Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin ? " Yahweh said , " Judah first . "
the children of Israel rose up in the morning , and encamped against Gibeah .
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah .
the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty @-@ two thousand men .
the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves , and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day .
the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day .
Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again Eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came to Bethel , and wept , and sat there before Yahweh , and fasted that day until evening ; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah .
the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was severe ; but they didn 't know that evil was close on them .
Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel ; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty @-@ five thousand one hundred men : all these drew the sword .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah .
the ambushers hurried , and rushed on Gibeah ; and the ambushers drew themselves along , and struck all the city with the edge of the sword .
now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city .
but when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them ; and behold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
the men of Israel turned , and the men of Benjamin were dismayed ; for they saw that evil had come on them .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst .
they surrounded the Benjamites , chased them , and trod them down at their resting place , as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrise .
there fell of Benjamin Eighteen thousand men ; all these were men of valor .
so that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty @-@ five thousand men who drew the sword ; all these were men of valor .
but six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon , and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months .
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the sword , both the entire city , and the livestock , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah , saying , " There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife . "
the people came to Bethel , and sat there until evening before God , and lifted up their voices , and wept severely .
they said , " Yahweh , the God of Israel , why has this happened in Israel , that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel ? "
it happened on the next day that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother , and said , " There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
how shall we provide wives for those who remain , since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ? "
they said , " What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn 't come up to Yahweh to Mizpah ? " behold , there came none to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly .
for when the people were numbered , behold , there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there .
this is the thing that you shall do : you shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman who has lain with a man . "
they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
the whole Congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon , and proclaimed peace to them .
the people grieved for Benjamin , because that Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel .
then the elders of the Congregation said , " How shall we provide wives for those who remain , since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin ? "
they said , " There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel .
however we may not give them wives of our daughters , for the children of Israel had sworn , saying , ' Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin . ' "
they said , " behold , there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh , which is on the north of Bethel , on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah . "
they commanded the children of Benjamin , saying , " Go and lie in wait in the vineyards ,
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel departed there at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .
in those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
Elimelech , Naomi 's husband , died ; and she was left , and her two sons .
they took them wives of the women of Moab ; the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth : and they lived there about ten years .
Mahlon and Chilion both died , and the woman was bereaved of her two children and of her husband .
then she arose with her daughters @-@ in @-@ law , that she might return from the country of Moab : for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters @-@ in @-@ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah .
Naomi said to her two daughters @-@ in @-@ law , " Go , return each of you to her mother 's house : Yahweh deal kindly with you , as you have dealt with the dead , and with me .
Yahweh grant you that you may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . " then she kissed them , and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
they said to her , " No , but we will return with you to your people . "
Naomi said , " Go back , my daughters . why do you want to go with me ? do I still have sons in my womb , that they may be your husbands ?
go back , my daughters , go your way ; for I am too old to have a husband . if I should say , ' I have hope , ' if I should even have a husband tonight , and should also bear sons ;
they lifted up their voice , and wept again : and Orpah kissed her mother @-@ in @-@ law , but Ruth joined with her .
she said , " behold , your sister @-@ in @-@ law has gone back to her people , and to her god . follow your sister @-@ in @-@ law . "
where you die , will I die , and there will I be buried . Yahweh do so to me , and more also , if anything but death part you and me . "
when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her , she left off speaking to her .
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . it happened , when they had come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they asked , " Is this Naomi ? "
she said to them , " Don 't call me Naomi . call me Mara ; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me .
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
Naomi had a kinsman of her husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of Elimelech , and his name was Boaz .
she went , and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz , who was of the family of Elimelech .
behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said to the reapers , " Yahweh be with you . " they answered him , " Yahweh bless you . "
then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers , " whose young lady is this ? "
the servant who was set over the reapers answered , " It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab .
then Boaz said to Ruth , " listen , my daughter . Don 't go to glean in another field , and don 't go from here , but stay here close to my maidens .
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
May Yahweh repay your work , and a full reward be given you from Yahweh , the God of Israel , under whose wings you have come to take refuge . "
then she said , " Let me find favor in your sight , my lord , because you have comforted me , and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid , though I am not as one of your handmaidens . "
when she had risen up to glean , Boaz commanded his young men , saying , " Let her glean even among the sheaves , and don 't reproach her .
also pull out some for her from the bundles , and leave it , and let her glean , and don 't rebuke her . "
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @-@ in @-@ law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed .
Ruth the Moabitess said , " Yes , he said to me , ' You shall stay close to my young men , until they have ended all my harvest . ' "
Naomi said to Ruth her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , " It is good , my daughter , that you go out with his maidens , and that they not meet you in any other field . "
so she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz , to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and she lived with her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Naomi her mother @-@ in @-@ law said to her , " My daughter , shall I not seek rest for you , that it may be well with you ?
now isn 't Boaz our kinsman , with whose maidens you were ? behold , he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor .
therefore wash yourself , anoint yourself , get dressed , and go down to the threshing floor , but don 't make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
she said to her , " All that you say I will do . "
she went down to the threshing floor , and did according to all that her mother @-@ in @-@ law told her .
it happened at midnight , that the man was startled and turned himself ; and behold , a woman lay at his feet .
he said , " Who are you ? " she answered , " I am Ruth your handmaid . therefore spread your skirt over your handmaid ; for you are a near kinsman . "
he said , " blessed are you by Yahweh , my daughter . you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning , inasmuch as you didn 't follow young men , whether poor or rich .
now , my daughter , don 't be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman .
now it is true that I am a near kinsman ; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.
when she came to her mother @-@ in @-@ law , she said , " How did it go , my daughter ? " she told her all that the man had done to her .
she said , " He gave me these six measures of barley ; for he said , ' Don 't go empty to your mother @-@ in @-@ law . ' "
he took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , " sit down here . " they sat down .
he said to the near kinsman , " Naomi , who has come back out of the country of Moab , is selling the parcel of land , which was our brother Elimelech 's .
so the near kinsman said to Boaz , " Buy it for yourself . " he took off his shoe .
Boaz said to the elders , and to all the people , " You are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech 's , and all that was Chilion 's and Mahlon 's , from the hand of Naomi .
let your house be like the house of Perez , whom Tamar bore to Judah , of the seed which Yahweh shall give you of this young woman . "
so Boaz took Ruth , and she became his wife ; and he went in to her , and Yahweh gave her conception , and she bore a son .
the women said to Naomi , " blessed be Yahweh , who has not left you this day without a near kinsman ; and let his name be famous in Israel .
he shall be to you a restorer of life , and sustain you in your old age , for your daughter @-@ in @-@ law , who loves you , who is better to you than seven sons , has borne him . "
Naomi took the child , and laid it in her bosom , and became nurse to it .
the women , her neighbors , gave him a name , saying , " There is a son born to Naomi " ; and they named him Obed . he is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
now this is the history of the generations of Perez : Perez became the father of Hezron ,
and Hezron became the father of Ram , and Ram became the father of Amminadab ,
and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon , and Nahshon became the father of salmon ,
and salmon became the father of Boaz , and Boaz became the father of Obed ,
and Obed became the father of Jesse , and Jesse became the father of David .
now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim , of the hill country of Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephraimite :
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of other Peninnah : and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed , he gave to Peninnah his wife , and to all her sons and her daughters , portions :
but to Hannah he gave a double portion ; for he loved Hannah , but Yahweh had shut up her womb .
her rival provoked her severely , to make her fret , because Yahweh had shut up her womb .
as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of Yahweh , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and didn 't eat .
Elkanah her husband said to her , " Hannah , why do you weep ? why don 't you eat ? why is your heart grieved ? am I not better to you than ten sons ? "
so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk . now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh 's temple .
she was in bitterness of soul , and prayed to Yahweh , and wept bitterly .
it happened , as she continued praying before Yahweh , that Eli saw her mouth .
now Hannah spoke in her heart . only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard . therefore Eli thought she had been drunken .
Eli said to her , " How long will you be drunken ? put away your wine from you . "
Don 't count your handmaid for a wicked woman ; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation . "
then Eli answered , " Go in peace ; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him . "
she said , " Let your handmaid find favor in your sight . " so the woman went her way , and ate ; and her facial expression wasn 't sad any more .
they rose up in the morning early , and worshiped before Yahweh , and returned , and came to their house to Ramah : and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife ; and Yahweh remembered her .
it happened , when the time had come , that Hannah conceived , and bore a son ; and she named him Samuel , saying , " Because I have asked him of Yahweh . "
the man Elkanah , and all his house , went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice , and his vow .
but Hannah didn 't go up ; for she said to her husband , " Not until the child is weaned ; then I will bring him , that he may appear before Yahweh , and stay there forever . "
when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bulls , and one ephah of meal , and a bottle of wine , and brought him to Yahweh 's house in Shiloh . the child was young .
they killed the bull , and brought the child to Eli .
she said , " Oh , my lord , as your soul lives , my lord , I am the woman who stood by you here , praying to Yahweh .
for this child I prayed ; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him .
Hannah prayed , and said : " my heart exults in Yahweh ! my Horn is exalted in Yahweh . my mouth is enlarged over my enemies , because I rejoice in your salvation .
there is no one as holy as Yahweh , For there is no one besides you , nor is there any rock like our God .
" talk no more so exceeding proudly . Don 't let arrogance come out of your mouth , For Yahweh is a God of knowledge . by him actions are weighed .
" the bows of the mighty men are broken . those who stumbled are armed with strength .
those who were full have hired themselves out for bread . those who were hungry are satisfied . yes , the barren has borne seven . she who has many children languishes .
" Yahweh kills , and makes alive . he brings down to Sheol , and brings up .
Yahweh makes poor , and makes rich . he brings low , he also lifts up .
he will keep the feet of his holy ones , but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness ; for no man shall prevail by strength .
those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces . he will Thunder against them in the sky . " Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth . he will give strength to his king , and exalt the Horn of his anointed . "
Elkanah went to Ramah to his house . the child served Yahweh before Eli the priest .
and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith . so they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there .
the sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh ; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh .
but Samuel ministered before Yahweh , being a child , clothed with a linen ephod .
moreover his mother made him a little robe , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
Yahweh visited Hannah , and she conceived , and bore three sons and two daughters . the child Samuel grew before Yahweh .
now Eli was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of Meeting .
he said to them , " Why do you do such things ? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people .
no , my sons ; for it is no good report that I hear : you make Yahweh 's people disobey .
the child Samuel grew on , and increased in favor both with Yahweh , and also with men .
a man of God came to Eli , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' did I reveal myself to the house of your father , when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh 's house ?
behold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
you shall see the affliction of my habitation , in all the wealth which I shall give Israel ; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever .
" ' this shall be the sign to you , that shall come on your two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas : in one day they shall both die .
I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my anointed forever .
the child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli . the word of Yahweh was precious in those days ; there was no frequent vision .
it happened at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place ( now his eyes had begun to grow dim , so that he could not see ) ,
and the lamp of God hadn 't yet gone out , and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh 's temple , where the Ark of God was ;
that Yahweh called Samuel ; and he said , " Here I am . "
he ran to Eli , and said , " Here I am ; for you called me . " he said , " I didn 't call ; lie down again . " he went and lay down .
now Samuel didn 't yet know Yahweh , neither was the word of Yahweh yet revealed to him .
Yahweh called Samuel again the third time . he arose and went to Eli , and said , " Here I am ; for you called me . " Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child .
therefore Eli said to Samuel , " Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he calls you , that you shall say , ' Speak , Yahweh ; for your servant hears . ' " so Samuel went and lay down in his place .
Yahweh came , and stood , and called as at other times , " Samuel ! Samuel ! " then Samuel said , " Speak ; for your servant hears . "
Yahweh said to Samuel , " behold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle .
in that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house , from the beginning even to the end .
for I have told him that I will judge his house forever , for the iniquity which he knew , because his sons brought a curse on themselves , and he didn 't restrain them .
Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh . Samuel feared to show Eli the vision .
then Eli called Samuel , and said , " Samuel , my son ! " he said , " Here I am . "
Samuel told him every bit , and hid nothing from him . he said , " It is Yahweh . let him do what seems good to him . "
Samuel grew , and Yahweh was with him , and let none of his words fall to the ground .
all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh .
Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh ; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh .
the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Philistines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
so the people sent to Shiloh ; and they brought from there the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh of Armies , who sits above the cherubim : and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there with the Ark of the Covenant of God .
when the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , " What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean ? " they understood that the Ark of Yahweh had come into the camp .
the Philistines were afraid , for they said , " God has come into the camp . " they said , " Woe to us ! for there has not been such a thing before .
Woe to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness .
the Philistines fought , and Israel was struck , and they fled every man to his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
the Ark of God was taken ; and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were slain .
there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Shiloh the same day , with his clothes torn , and with earth on his head .
when Eli heard the noise of the crying , he said , " What does the noise of this tumult mean ? " the man hurried , and came and told Eli .
now Eli was ninety @-@ eight years old ; and his eyes were set , so that he could not see .
the man said to Eli , " I am he who came out of the army , and I fled today out of the army . " he said , " How did the matter go , my son ? "
he who brought the news answered , " Israel has fled before the Philistines , and there has been also a great slaughter among the people . your two sons also , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead , and the Ark of God has been captured . "
about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her , " Don 't be afraid ; for you have given birth to a son . " but she didn 't answer , neither did she regard it .
she said , " The glory has departed from Israel ; for the Ark of God is taken . "
now the Philistines had taken the Ark of God , and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod .
the Philistines took the Ark of God , and brought it into the house of Dagon , and set it by Dagon .
when they of Ashdod arose early on the next day , behold , Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the Ark of Yahweh . they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any who come into Dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod , to this day .
when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so , they said , " The Ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us ; for his hand is severe on us , and on Dagon our god . "
it was so , that after they had carried it about , the hand of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion : and he struck the men of the city , both small and great ; and tumors broke out on them .
the men who didn 't die were struck with the tumors ; and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
the Ark of Yahweh was in the country of the Philistines seven months .
the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , " What shall we do with the Ark of Yahweh ? show us with which we shall send it to its place . "
therefore you shall make images of your tumors , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
why then do you harden your hearts , as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts ? when he had worked wonderfully among them , didn 't they let the people go , and they departed ?
" now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart , and two milk cows , on which there has come no yoke ; and tie the cows to the cart , and bring their calves home from them ;
the men did so , and took two milk cows , and tied them to the cart , and shut up their calves at home ;
and they put the Ark of Yahweh on the cart , and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors .
the cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh ; they went along the highway , lowing as they went , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh .
they of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley ; and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ark , and rejoiced to see it .
the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they split the wood of the cart , and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
the Levites took down the Ark of Yahweh , and the coffer that was with it , in which the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh .
when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it , they returned to Ekron the same day .
these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to Yahweh : for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Ashkelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ;
the men of Beth Shemesh said , " Who is able to stand before Yahweh , this holy God ? to whom shall he go up from us ? "
the men of Kiriath Jearim came , and fetched up the Ark of Yahweh , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the Ark of Yahweh .
it happened , from the day that the Ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh .
then the children of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth , and served Yahweh only .
Samuel said , " Gather all Israel to Mizpah , and I will pray for you to Yahweh . "
they gathered together to Mizpah , and drew water , and poured it out before Yahweh , and fasted on that day , and said there , " We have sinned against Yahweh . " Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah .
when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don 't cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines . "
Samuel took a suckling lamb , and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Yahweh : and Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel ; and Yahweh answered him .
as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel ; but Yahweh thundered with a great Thunder on that day on the Philistines , and confused them ; and they were struck down before Israel .
the men of Israel went out of Mizpah , and pursued the Philistines , and struck them , until they came under Beth Kar .
then Samuel took a stone , and set it between Mizpah and Shen , and called its name Ebenezer , saying , " Yahweh helped us until now . "
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more within the border of Israel . the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel , from Ekron even to Gath ; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines . there was peace between Israel and the Amorites .
Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life .
he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal , and Mizpah ; and he judged Israel in all those places .
his return was to Ramah , for there was his house ; and there he judged Israel : and he built there an altar to Yahweh .
it happened , when Samuel was old , that he made his sons judges over Israel .
now the name of his firstborn was Joel ; and the name of his second , Abijah : they were judges in Beersheba .
his sons didn 't walk in his ways , but turned aside after lucre , and took bribes , and perverted justice .
then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together , and came to Samuel to Ramah ;
and they said to him , " behold , you are old , and your sons don 't walk in your ways : now make us a king to judge us like all the nations . "
but the thing displeased Samuel , when they said , " Give us a king to judge us . " Samuel prayed to Yahweh .
Yahweh said to Samuel , " listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
now therefore listen to their voice : however you shall protest solemnly to them , and shall show them the way of the king who shall reign over them . "
Samuel told all the words of Yahweh to the people who asked of him a king .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and they shall run before his chariots ;
he will take your daughters to be perfumers , and to be cooks , and to be Bakers .
he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your olive groves , even their best , and give them to his servants .
he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your donkeys , and put them to his work .
he will take the tenth of your flocks : and you shall be his servants .
you shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall have chosen you ; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day . "
but the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel ; and they said , " No ; but we will have a king over us ,
that we also may be like all the nations , and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles . "
Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh .
Yahweh said to Samuel , " listen to their voice , and make them a king . " Samuel said to the men of Israel , " Every man go to his city . "
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Becorath , the son of Aphiah , the son of a Benjamite , a mighty man of valor .
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
the donkeys of Kish , Saul 's father , were lost . Kish said to Saul his son , " Take now one of the servants with you , and arise , go seek the donkeys . "
when they had come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant who was with him , " Come , and let us return , lest my father stop caring about the donkeys , and be anxious for us . "
the servant answered Saul again , and said , " behold , I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver . I will give that to the man of God , to tell us our way . "
( in earlier times in Israel , when a man went to inquire of God , thus he said , " Come , and let us go to the seer " ; for he who is now called a prophet was before called a Seer . )
then Saul said to his servant , " Well said . come , let us go . " so they went to the city where the man of God was .
as they went up the ascent to the city , they found young maidens going out to draw water , and said to them , " Is the seer here ? "
they answered them , and said , " He is . behold , he is before you . hurry now , for he has come today into the city ; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place .
they went up to the city . as they came within the city , behold , Samuel came out toward them , to go up to the high place .
now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came , saying ,
when Samuel saw Saul , Yahweh said to him , " behold , the man of whom I spoke to you ! this same shall have authority over my people . "
then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , " Please tell me where the seer 's house is . "
as for your donkeys who were lost three days ago , don 't set your mind on them ; for they are found . for whom is all that is desirable in Israel ? is it not for you , and for all your father 's house ? "
Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the guest room , and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited , who were about thirty persons .
Samuel said to the cook , " Bring the portion which I gave you , of which I said to you , ' Set it aside . ' "
when they had come down from the high place into the city , he talked with Saul on the housetop .
they arose early : and it happened about the spring of the day , that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop , saying , " Get up , that I may send you away . " Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then Samuel took the vial of oil , and poured it on his head , and kissed him , and said , " Isn 't it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance ?
and they will greet you , and give you two loaves of bread , which you shall receive of their hand .
and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you , and you shall prophesy with them , and shall be turned into another man .
let it be , when these signs have come to you , that you do as occasion shall serve you ; for God is with you .
it was so , that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , God gave him another heart : and all those signs happened that day .
when they came there to the hill , behold , a band of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him , and he prophesied among them .
it happened , when all who knew him before saw that , behold , he prophesied with the prophets , then the people said one to another , " What is this that has come to the son of Kish ? is Saul also among the prophets ? "
one of the same place answered , " Who is their father ? " therefore it became a proverb , " Is Saul also among the prophets ? "
when he had made an end of prophesying , he came to the high place .
Saul 's uncle said , " Please tell me what Samuel said to you . "
Saul said to his uncle , " He told us plainly that the donkeys were found . " but concerning the matter of the kingdom , of which Samuel spoke , he didn 't tell him .
so Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near , and the tribe of Benjamin was taken .
he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families ; and the family of the Matrites was taken ; and Saul the son of Kish was taken : but when they sought him , he could not be found .
therefore they asked of Yahweh further , " Is there yet a man to come here ? " Yahweh answered , " behold , he has hidden himself among the baggage . "
they ran and fetched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yahweh . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
Saul also went to his house to Gibeah ; and there went with him the army , whose hearts God had touched .
but certain worthless fellows said , " How shall this man save us ? " they despised him , and brought him no present . but he held his peace .
then Nahash the Ammonite came up , and encamped against Jabesh Gilead : and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash , " Make a Covenant with us , and we will serve you . "
then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul , and spoke these words in the ears of the people : and all the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
behold , Saul came following the oxen out of the field ; and Saul said , " What ails the people that they weep ? " they told him the words of the men of Jabesh .
the Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words , and his anger was kindled greatly .
he numbered them in Bezek ; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
they said to the messengers who came , " Thus you shall tell the men of Jabesh Gilead , ' Tomorrow , by the time the sun is hot , you shall have deliverance . ' " the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh ; and they were glad .
therefore the men of Jabesh said , " Tomorrow we will come out to you , and you shall do with us all that seems good to you . "
the people said to Samuel , " Who is he who said , ' shall Saul reign over us ? ' bring those men , that we may put them to death ! "
Saul said , " There shall not a man be put to death this day ; for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel . "
then Samuel said to the people , " Come , and let us go to Gilgal , and renew the kingdom there . "
Samuel said to all Israel , " behold , I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me , and have made a king over you .
now , behold , the king walks before you ; and I am old and gray @-@ headed ; and behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my youth to this day .
they said , " You have not defrauded us , nor oppressed us , neither have you taken anything of any man 's hand . "
he said to them , " Yahweh is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that you have not found anything in my hand . " they said , " He is witness . "
Samuel said to the people , " It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh , which he did to you and to your fathers .
" when Jacob had come into Egypt , and your fathers cried to Yahweh , then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron , who brought your fathers out of Egypt , and made them to dwell in this place .
" but they forgot Yahweh their God ; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the army of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab ; and they fought against them .
they cried to Yahweh , and said , ' We have sinned , because we have forsaken Yahweh , and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve you . '
" when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , you said to me , ' No , but a king shall reign over us ; ' when Yahweh your God was your king .
now therefore see the king whom you have chosen , and whom you have asked for : and behold , Yahweh has set a king over you .
if you will fear Yahweh , and serve him , and listen to his voice , and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh , but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then will the hand of Yahweh be against you , as it was against your fathers .
" now therefore stand still and see this great thing , which Yahweh will do before your eyes .
so Samuel called to Yahweh ; and Yahweh sent Thunder and rain that day : and all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel .
Samuel said to the people , " Don 't be afraid . you have indeed done all this evil ; yet don 't turn aside from following Yahweh , but serve Yahweh with all your heart .
Don 't turn aside to go after vain things which can 't profit nor deliver , for they are vain .
for Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name 's sake , because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself .
moreover as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you : but I will instruct you in the good and the right way .
only fear Yahweh , and serve him in truth with all your heart ; for consider how great things he has done for you .
but if you shall still do wickedly , you shall be consumed , both you and your king . "
Saul reigned a year ; and when he had reigned two years over Israel ,
Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba : and the Philistines heard of it . Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land , saying , " Let the Hebrews hear ! "
all Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines , and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines . the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal .
the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand chariots , and six thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude : and they came up , and encamped in Michmash , eastward of Beth Aven .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in coverts , and in pits .
now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead ; but as for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
he stayed seven days , according to the time set by Samuel : but Samuel didn 't come to Gilgal ; and the people were scattered from him .
Saul said , " Bring here the burnt offering to me , and the peace offerings . " he offered the burnt offering .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might greet him .
therefore I said , ' Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal , and I haven 't entreated the favor of Yahweh . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the burnt offering . "
Samuel said to Saul , " You have done foolishly . you have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God , which he commanded you ; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever .
but now your kingdom shall not continue . Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart , and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people , because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you . "
Samuel arose , and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin . Saul numbered the people who were present with him , about six hundred men .
Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people who were present with them , stayed in Geba of Benjamin : but the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah , to the land of Shual ;
now there was no Smith found throughout all the land of Israel ; for the Philistines said , " Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears " ;
but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines , to sharpen every man his plowshare , mattock , axe , and sickle ;
yet they had a file for the mattocks , and for the plowshares , and for the forks , and for the axes , and to set the goads .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash .
now it fell on a day , that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor , " Come , and let us go over to the Philistines ' garrison , that is on the other side . " but he didn 't tell his father .
Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron : and the people who were with him were about six hundred men ;
and Ahijah , the son of Ahitub , Ichabod 's brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh , wearing an ephod . the people didn 't know that Jonathan was gone .
between the passes , by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines ' garrison , there was a rocky crag on the one side , and a rocky crag on the other side : and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
the one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash , and the other on the south in front of Geba .
his armor bearer said to him , " Do all that is in your heart . turn and , behold , I am with you according to your heart . "
then Jonathan said , " behold , we will pass over to the men , and we will reveal ourselves to them .
if they say thus to us , ' wait until we come to you ! ' then we will stand still in our place , and will not go up to them .
but if they say this , ' Come up to us ! ' then we will go up ; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand . this shall be the sign to us . "
both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines : and the Philistines said , " behold , the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves ! "
Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet , and his armor bearer after him : and they fell before Jonathan ; and his armor bearer killed them after him .
that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armor bearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were half a furrow 's length in an acre of land .
the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked ; and behold , the multitude melted away , and scattered .
then Saul said to the people who were with him , " Count now , and see who is missing from us . " when they had counted , behold , Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there .
Saul said to Ahijah , " Bring the Ark of God here . " for the Ark of God was with the children of Israel at that time .
it happened , while Saul talked to the priest , that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased : and Saul said to the priest , " Withdraw your hand ! "
Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together , and came to the battle : and behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow : a very great confusion .
now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
so Yahweh saved Israel that day : and the battle passed over by Beth Aven .
but Jonathan didn 't hear when his father commanded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand , and dipped it in the honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
then Jonathan said , " My father has troubled the land . please look how my eyes have been enlightened , because I tasted a little of this honey .
how much more , if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found ? for now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines . "
they struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon . the people were very faint ;
and the people flew on the spoil , and took sheep , and cattle , and calves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
Saul built an altar to Yahweh . this was the first altar that he built to Yahweh .
Saul asked counsel of God , " shall I go down after the Philistines ? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel ? " but he didn 't answer him that day .
Saul said , " Draw near here , all you chiefs of the people ; and know and see in which this sin has been this day .
for , as Yahweh lives , who saves Israel , though it is in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die . " but there was not a man among all the people who answered him .
therefore Saul said to Yahweh , the God of Israel , " Show the right . " Jonathan and Saul were chosen ; but the people escaped .
Saul said , " cast lots between me and Jonathan my son . " Jonathan was selected .
Saul said , " God do so and more also ; for you shall surely die , Jonathan . "
then Saul went up from following the Philistines ; and the Philistines went to their own place .
now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel , he fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines : and wherever he turned himself , he defeated them .
he did valiantly , and struck the Amalekites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishvi , and Malchishua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz . the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
Kish was the father of Saul ; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel .
there was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any mighty man , or any valiant man , he took him to him .
Samuel said to Saul , " Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people , over Israel . now therefore listen to the voice of the words of Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , ' I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel , how he set himself against him in the way , when he came up out of Egypt .
Saul summoned the people , and numbered them in Telaim , two hundred thousand footmen , and ten thousand men of Judah .
Saul came to the city of Amalek , and laid wait in the valley .
Saul struck the Amalekites , from Havilah as you go to Shur , that is before Egypt .
he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive , and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
then the word of Yahweh came to Samuel , saying ,
" it grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king ; for he is turned back from following me , and has not performed my commandments . " Samuel was angry ; and he cried to Yahweh all night .
Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning ; and it was told Samuel , saying , " Saul came to Carmel , and behold , he set up a monument for himself , and turned , and passed on , and went down to Gilgal . "
Samuel came to Saul ; and Saul said to him , " You are blessed by Yahweh ! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh . "
Samuel said , " Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears , and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean ? "
then Samuel said to Saul , " Stay , and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me last night . " he said to him , " Say on . "
Samuel said , " Though you were little in your own sight , weren 't you made the head of the tribes of Israel ? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel ;
and Yahweh sent you on a journey , and said , ' Go , and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites , and fight against them until they are consumed . '
why then didn 't you obey the voice of Yahweh , but took the spoils , and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ? "
Saul said to Samuel , " But I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh , and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me , and have brought Agag the king of Amalek , and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft , and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim . because you have rejected the word of Yahweh , he has also rejected you from being king . "
Saul said to Samuel , " I have sinned ; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh , and your words , because I feared the people , and obeyed their voice .
now therefore , please pardon my sin , and turn again with me , that I may worship Yahweh . "
Samuel said to Saul , " I will not return with you ; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh , and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel . "
as Samuel turned about to go away , Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe , and it tore .
Samuel said to him , " Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day , and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you .
also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent ; for he is not a man , that he should repent . "
then he said , " I have sinned : yet please honor me now before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and come back with me , that I may worship Yahweh your God . "
so Samuel went back with Saul ; and Saul worshiped Yahweh .
then Samuel said , " Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites ! " Agag came to him cheerfully . Agag said , " surely the bitterness of death is past . "
Samuel said , " As your sword has made women childless , so your mother will be childless among women ! " Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal .
then Samuel went to Ramah ; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul .
Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death ; for Samuel mourned for Saul : and Yahweh grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel .
Samuel said , " How can I go ? if Saul hears it , he will kill me . " Yahweh said , " Take a heifer with you , and say , I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh .
call Jesse to the sacrifice , and I will show you what you shall do . you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you . "
Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke , and came to Bethlehem . the elders of the city came to meet him trembling , and said , " Do you come peaceably ? "
it happened , when they had come , that he looked at Eliab , and said , " surely Yahweh 's anointed is before him . "
then Jesse called Abinadab , and made him pass before Samuel . he said , " Neither has Yahweh chosen this one . "
then Jesse made Shammah to pass by . he said , " Neither has Yahweh chosen this one . "
Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel . Samuel said to Jesse , " Yahweh has not chosen these . "
then Samuel took the Horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brothers : and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul , and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him .
Saul 's servants said to him , " See now , an evil spirit from God troubles you .
Saul said to his servants , " Provide me now a man who can play well , and bring him to me . "
therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse , and said , " Send me David your son , who is with the sheep . "
Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread , and a bottle of wine , and a young goat , and sent them by David his son to Saul .
David came to Saul , and stood before him . he loved him greatly ; and he became his armor bearer .
Saul sent to Jesse , saying , " Please let David stand before me ; for he has found favor in my sight . "
now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle ; and they were gathered together at Socoh , which belongs to Judah , and encamped between Socoh and Azekah , in Ephesdammim .
Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and encamped in the valley of Elah , and set the battle in array against the Philistines .
the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
he had a helmet of brass on his head , and he was clad with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
he had brass shin armor on his legs , and a javelin of brass between his shoulders .
the staff of his spear was like a weaver 's beam ; and his spear 's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and his shield bearer went before him .
the Philistine said , " I defy the armies of Israel this day ! give me a man , that we may fight together ! "
when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine , they were dismayed , and greatly afraid .
now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Saul , stricken among men .
the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next to him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
David was the youngest ; and the three eldest followed Saul .
now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father 's sheep at Bethlehem .
Jesse said to David his son , " Now take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain , and these ten loaves , and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers ;
and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand , and see how your brothers are doing , and bring back news . "
now Saul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array , army against army .
David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the ranks of the Philistines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were terrified .
the people answered him in this way , saying , " So shall it be done to the man who kills him . "
he turned away from him toward another , and spoke like that again ; and the people answered him again the same way .
when the words were heard which David spoke , they rehearsed them before Saul ; and he sent for him .
David said to Saul , " Let no man 's heart fail because of him . your servant will go and fight with this Philistine . "
Saul said to David , " You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him ; for you are but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth . "
David said to Saul , " Your servant was keeping his father 's sheep ; and when a lion or a bear came , and took a lamb out of the flock ,
your servant struck both the lion and the bear . this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them , since he has defied the armies of the living God . "
David said , " Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . " Saul said to David , " Go ; and Yahweh shall be with you . "
Saul dressed David with his clothing . he put a helmet of brass on his head , and he clad him with a coat of mail .
he took his staff in his hand , and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the Brook , and put them in the shepherd 's bag which he had , even in his wallet . his sling was in his hand ; and he drew near to the Philistine .
the Philistine came on and drew near to David ; and the man who bore the shield went before him .
when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him ; for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and withal of a fair face .
the Philistine said to David , " Am I a dog , that you come to me with sticks ? " the Philistine Cursed David by his gods .
the Philistine said to David , " Come to me , and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky , and to the animals of the field . "
and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn 't save with sword and spear : for the battle is Yahweh 's , and he will give you into our hand . "
it happened , when the Philistine arose , and came and drew near to meet David , that David hurried , and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and slung it , and struck the Philistine in his forehead ; and the stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the earth .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and struck the Philistine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
then David ran , and stood over the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of its sheath , and killed him , and cut off his head therewith . when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , they fled .
the men of Israel and of Judah arose , and shouted , and pursued the Philistines , until you come to Gai , and to the gates of Ekron . the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim , even to Gath , and to Ekron .
the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines , and they plundered their camp .
the king said , " inquire whose son the young man is ! "
as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , Abner took him , and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
Saul said to him , " whose son are you , you young man ? " David answered , " I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite . "
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking to Saul , that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul .
Saul took him that day , and would let him go no more home to his father 's house .
then Jonathan and David made a Covenant , because he loved him as his own soul .
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clothing , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his sash .
the women sang one to another as they played , and said , " Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands . "
Saul eyed David from that day and forward .
it happened on the next day , that an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul , and he prophesied in the midst of the house . David played with his hand , as he did day by day . Saul had his spear in his hand ;
and Saul threw the spear ; for he said , " I will pin David even to the wall ! " David escaped from his presence twice .
Saul was afraid of David , because Yahweh was with him , and was departed from Saul .
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
David behaved himself wisely in all his ways ; and Yahweh was with him .
when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely , he stood in awe of him .
but all Israel and Judah loved David ; for he went out and came in before them .
David said to Saul , " Who am I , and what is my life , or my father 's family in Israel , that I should be son @-@ in @-@ law to the king ? "
but it happened at the time when Merab , Saul 's daughter , should have been given to David , that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife .
Michal , Saul 's daughter , loved David ; and they told Saul , and the thing pleased him .
Saul commanded his servants , " talk with David secretly , and say , ' behold , the king has delight in you , and all his servants love you : now therefore be the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law . ' "
Saul 's servants spoke those words in the ears of David . David said , " Does it seems to you a light thing to be the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law , since I am a poor man , and lightly esteemed ? "
the servants of Saul told him , saying , " David spoke like this . "
when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law . the days were not expired ;
Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David ; and Michal , Saul 's daughter , loved him .
Saul was yet the more afraid of David ; and Saul was David 's enemy continually .
then the princes of the Philistines went forth : and it happened , as often as they went forth , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul ; so that his name was highly esteemed .
I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan : and Saul swore , " As Yahweh lives , he shall not be put to death . "
Jonathan called David , and Jonathan showed him all those things . Jonathan brought David to Saul , and he was in his presence , as before .
there was war again . David went out , and fought with the Philistines , and killed them with a great slaughter ; and they fled before him .
an evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul , as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand ; and David was playing with his hand .
Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he stuck the spear into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
Saul sent messengers to David 's house , to watch him , and to kill him in the morning . Michal , David 's wife , told him , saying , " If you don 't save your life tonight , tomorrow you will be killed . "
so Michal let David down through the window . he went , fled , and escaped .
Michal took the teraphim , and laid it in the bed , and put a pillow of goats ' hair at its head , and covered it with the clothes .
when Saul sent messengers to take David , she said , " He is sick . "
Saul sent the messengers to see David , saying , " Bring him up to me in the bed , that I may kill him . "
when the messengers came in , behold , the teraphim was in the bed , with the pillow of goats ' hair at its head .
now David fled , and escaped , and came to Samuel to Ramah , and told him all that Saul had done to him . he and Samuel went and lived in Naioth .
it was told Saul , saying , " behold , David is at Naioth in Ramah . "
when it was told Saul , he sent other messengers , and they also prophesied . Saul sent messengers again the third time , and they also prophesied .
then went he also to Ramah , and came to the great well that is in Secu : and he asked , " Where are Samuel and David ? " one said , " behold , they are at Naioth in Ramah . "
he went there to Naioth in Ramah . then the Spirit of God came on him also , and he went on , and prophesied , until he came to Naioth in Ramah .
David fled from Naioth in Ramah , and came and said before Jonathan , " What have I done ? what is my iniquity ? what is my sin before your father , that he seeks my life ? "
then Jonathan said to David , " Whatever your soul desires , I will even do it for you . "
David said to Jonathan , " behold , tomorrow is the new moon , and I should not fail to dine with the king ; but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening .
if your father miss me at all , then say , ' David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city ; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family . '
if he says , ' It is well ; ' your servant shall have peace : but if he be angry , then know that evil is determined by him .
therefore deal kindly with your servant ; for you have brought your servant into a Covenant of Yahweh with you : but if there is iniquity in me , kill me yourself ; for why should you bring me to your father ? "
Jonathan said , " Far be it from you ; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you , then wouldn 't I tell you that ? "
then David said to Jonathan , " Who shall tell me if perchance your father answers you roughly ? "
you shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness of Yahweh , that I not die ;
but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever ; no , not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth . "
so Jonathan made a Covenant with the house of David , saying , " Yahweh will require it at the hand of David 's enemies . "
Jonathan caused David to swear again , for the love that he had to him ; for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
then Jonathan said to him , " Tomorrow is the new moon : and you will be missed , because your seat will be empty .
when you have stayed three days , you shall go down quickly , and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started , and shall remain by the stone Ezel .
I will shoot three arrows on its side , as though I shot at a mark .
but if I say this to the boy , ' behold , the arrows are beyond you ; ' then go your way ; for Yahweh has sent you away .
concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of , behold , Yahweh is between you and me forever . "
so David hid himself in the field : and when the new moon had come , the king sat him down to eat food .
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jonathan stood up , and Abner sat by Saul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
Jonathan answered Saul , " David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem .
for as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth , you shall not be established , nor your kingdom . therefore now send and bring him to me , for he shall surely die ! "
Jonathan answered Saul his father , and said to him , " Why should he be put to death ? what has he done ? "
Saul cast his spear at him to strike him . by this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death .
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and ate no food the second day of the month ; for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
it happened in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little boy with him .
he said to his boy , " Run , find now the arrows which I shoot . " as the boy ran , he shot an arrow beyond him .
when the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the boy , and said , " Isn 't the arrow beyond you ? "
Jonathan cried after the boy , " Go fast ! hurry ! Don 't delay ! " Jonathan 's boy gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
but the boy didn 't know anything . only Jonathan and David knew the matter .
Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy , and said to him , " Go , carry them to the city . "
as soon as the boy was gone , David arose out of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times . they kissed one another , and wept one with another , and David wept the most .
then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest . Ahimelech came to meet David trembling , and said to him , " Why are you alone , and no man with you ? "
now therefore what is under your hand ? give me five loaves of bread in my hand , or whatever there is present . "
the priest answered David , and said , " There is no common bread under my hand , but there is holy bread ; if only the young men have kept themselves from women . "
now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before Yahweh ; and his name was Doeg the Edomite , the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul .
David arose , and fled that day for fear of Saul , and went to Achish the king of Gath .
the servants of Achish said to him , " Isn 't this David the king of the land ? Didn 't they sing one to another about him in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
then Achish said to his servants , " Look , you see the man is mad . why then have you brought him to me ?
do I lack madmen , that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence ? shall this fellow come into my house ? "
David therefore departed there , and escaped to the cave of Adullam . when his brothers and all his father 's house heard it , they went down there to him .
everyone who was in distress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was discontented , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
he brought them before the king of Moab ; and they lived with him all the while that David was in the stronghold .
the prophet Gad said to David , " Don 't stay in the stronghold . depart , and go into the land of Judah . " then David departed , and came into the forest of Hereth .
Saul heard that David was discovered , and the men who were with him . now Saul was sitting in Gibeah , under the tamarisk tree in Ramah , with his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him .
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " Hear now , you Benjamites ! will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ,
then Doeg the Edomite , who stood by the servants of Saul , answered and said , " I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob , to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub .
he inquired of Yahweh for him , gave him food , and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine . "
then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests who were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
Saul said , " Hear now , you son of Ahitub . " he answered , " Here I am , my lord . "
the king said , " You shall surely die , Ahimelech , you , and all your father 's house . "
he struck Nob , the city of the priests , with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and nursing babies , and cattle and donkeys and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
one of the sons of Ahimelech , the son of Ahitub , named Abiathar , escaped , and fled after David .
Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh 's priests .
stay with me , don 't be afraid ; for he who seeks my life seeks your life . for with me you shall be in safeguard . "
David was told , " behold , the Philistines are fighting against Keilah , and are robbing the threshing floors . "
therefore David inquired of Yahweh , saying , " shall I go and strike these Philistines ? " Yahweh said to David , " Go strike the Philistines , and save Keilah . "
David 's men said to him , " behold , we are afraid here in Judah : how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines ? "
then David inquired of Yahweh yet again . Yahweh answered him , and said , " arise , go down to Keilah ; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand . "
David and his men went to Keilah , and fought with the Philistines , and brought away their livestock , and killed them with a great slaughter . so David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
it happened , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah . Saul said , " God has delivered him into my hand ; for he is shut in , by entering into a town that has gates and bars . "
Saul summoned all the people to war , to go down to Keilah , to besiege David and his men .
David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him ; and he said to Abiathar the priest , " Bring the ephod here . "
then David said , " O Yahweh , the God of Israel , your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah , to destroy the city for my sake .
then David and his men , who were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Keilah , and went wherever they could go . it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah ; and he gave up going there .
David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds , and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph . Saul sought him every day , but God didn 't deliver him into his hand .
David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life . David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood .
Jonathan , Saul 's son , arose , and went to David into the woods , and strengthened his hand in God .
he said to him , " Don 't be afraid ; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you ; and you shall be king over Israel , and I shall be next to you ; and that also Saul my father knows . "
they both made a Covenant before Yahweh : and David stayed in the woods , and Jonathan went to his house .
then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah , saying , " Doesn 't David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of the desert ?
now therefore , O king , come down , according to all the desire of your soul to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king 's hand . "
Saul said , " You are blessed by Yahweh ; for you have had compassion on me .
please go make yet more sure , and know and see his place where his haunt is , and who has seen him there ; for it is told me that he deals very subtly .
they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the Arabah on the south of the desert .
Saul and his men went to seek him . when David was told , he went down to the rock , and stayed in the wilderness of Maon . when Saul heard that , he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon .
Saul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul ; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them .
but a messenger came to Saul , saying , " hurry and come ; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land ! "
so Saul returned from pursuing after David , and went against the Philistines : therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth .
David went up from there , and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi .
it happened , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , " behold , David is in the wilderness of En Gedi . "
then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats .
he came to the sheep pens by the way , where there was a cave ; and Saul went in to relieve himself . now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave .
it happened afterward , that David 's heart struck him , because he had cut off Saul 's skirt .
so David checked his men with these words , and didn 't allow them to rise against Saul . Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
David also arose afterward , and went out of the cave , and cried after Saul , saying , " My lord the king ! " when Saul looked behind him , David bowed with his face to the earth , and showed respect .
David said to Saul , " Why do you listen to men 's words , saying , ' behold , David seeks your hurt ? '
May Yahweh judge between me and you , and may Yahweh avenge me of you ; but my hand shall not be on you .
as the proverb of the ancients says , ' Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness ; ' but my hand shall not be on you .
against whom has the king of Israel come out ? whom do you pursue ? a dead dog ? a flea ?
May Yahweh therefore be judge , and give sentence between me and you , and see , and plead my cause , and deliver me out of your hand . "
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul , that Saul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
he said to David , " You are more righteous than I ; for you have done good to me , whereas I have done evil to you .
you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me , because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand , you didn 't kill me .
for if a man finds his enemy , will he let him go away unharmed ? therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day .
now , behold , I know that you shall surely be king , and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand .
swear now therefore to me by Yahweh , that you will not cut off my seed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
David swore to Saul . Saul went home ; but David and his men went up to the stronghold .
Samuel died ; and all Israel gathered themselves together , and lamented him , and buried him in his house at Ramah . David arose , and went down to the wilderness of Paran .
there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was Shearing his sheep in Carmel .
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was Shearing his sheep .
David sent ten young men , and David said to the young men , " Go up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name .
you shall tell him , ' Long life to you ! peace be to you , and peace be to your house , and peace be to all that you have .
now I have heard that you have shearers . your shepherds have now been with us , and we didn 't hurt them , neither was there anything missing from them , all the while they were in Carmel .
ask your young men , and they will tell you . therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes ; for we come in a good day . please give whatever comes to your hand , to your servants , and to your son David . ' "
when David 's young men came , they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David , and ceased .
Nabal answered David 's servants , and said , " Who is David ? who is the son of Jesse ? there are many servants who break away from their masters these days .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my meat that I have killed for my shearers , and give it to men who I don 't know where they come from ? "
so David 's young men turned on their way , and went back , and came and told him according to all these words .
but one of the young men told Abigail , Nabal 's wife , saying , " behold , David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master ; and he railed at them .
but the men were very good to us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we anything , as long as we went with them , when we were in the fields .
they were a wall to us both by night and by day , all the while we were with them keeping the sheep .
now therefore know and consider what you will do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his house ; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can 't speak to him . "
she said to her young men , " Go on before me . behold , I come after you . " but she didn 't tell her husband , Nabal .
it was so , as she rode on her donkey , and came down by the covert of the mountain , that behold , David and his men came down toward her ; and she met them .
God do so to the enemies of David , and more also , if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall . "
when Abigail saw David , she hurried , and alighted from her donkey , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground .
she fell at his feet , and said , " On me , my lord , on me be the iniquity ; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears . hear the words of your handmaid .
now this present which your servant has brought to my lord , let it be given to the young men who follow my lord .
please forgive the trespass of your handmaid . for Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house , because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh ; and evil shall not be found in you all your days .
though men may rise up to pursue you , and to seek your soul , yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God . he will sling out the souls of your enemies , as from the hollow of a sling .
it shall come to pass , when Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you , and shall have appointed you prince over Israel ,
that this shall be no grief to you , nor offense of heart to my lord , either that you have shed blood without cause , or that my lord has avenged himself . when Yahweh has dealt well with my lord , then remember your handmaid . "
David said to Abigail , " blessed is Yahweh , the God of Israel , who sent you this day to meet me !
blessed is your discretion , and blessed are you , that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness , and from avenging myself with my own hand .
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " Go up in peace to your house . behold , I have listened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
Abigail came to Nabal ; and behold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king . Nabal 's heart was merry within him , for he was very drunken . therefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
it happened about ten days after , that Yahweh struck Nabal , so that he died .
when the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel , they spoke to her , saying , " David has sent us to you , to take you to him as wife . "
she arose , and bowed herself with her face to the earth , and said , " behold , your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord . "
Abigail hurried , and arose , and rode on a donkey , with five ladies of hers who followed her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel ; and they both became his wives .
now Saul had given Michal his daughter , David 's wife , to Palti the son of Laish , who was of Gallim .
the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah , saying , " Doesn 't David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah , which is before the desert ? "
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah , which is before the desert , by the way . but David stayed in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
David therefore sent out spies , and understood that Saul had certainly come .
David arose , and came to the place where Saul had encamped ; and David saw the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his army : and Saul lay within the place of the wagons , and the people were encamped around him .
so David and Abishai came to the people by night : and , behold , Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons , with his spear stuck in the ground at his head ; and Abner and the people lay around him .
David said to Abishai , " Don 't destroy him ; for who can put forth his hand against Yahweh 's anointed , and be guiltless ? "
David said , " As Yahweh lives , Yahweh will strike him ; or his day shall come to die ; or he shall go down into battle and perish .
Yahweh forbid that I should put forth my hand against Yahweh 's anointed ; but now please take the spear that is at his head , and the jar of water , and let us go . "
then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of the mountain afar off ; a great space being between them ;
Saul knew David 's voice , and said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " David said , " It is my voice , my lord , O king . "
he said , " Why does my lord pursue after his servant ? for what have I done ? or what evil is in my hand ?
now therefore , don 't let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh ; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea , as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains . "
David answered , " behold the spear , O king ! then let one of the young men come over and get it .
Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness ; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today , and I wouldn 't put forth my hand against Yahweh 's anointed .
behold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yahweh , and let him deliver me out of all oppression . "
David arose , and passed over , he and the six hundred men who were with him , to Achish the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
David lived with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife .
it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath : and he sought no more again for him .
then Achish gave him Ziklag that day : why Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day .
the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months .
David struck the land , and saved neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the cattle , and the donkeys , and the camels , and the clothing ; and he returned , and came to Achish .
Achish said , " Against whom have you made a raid today ? " David said , " Against the South of Judah , against the South of the Jerahmeelites , and against the South of the Kenites . "
Achish believed David , saying , " He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him . therefore he shall be my servant forever . "
it happened in those days , that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . Achish said to David , " Know assuredly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
the Philistines gathered themselves together , and came and encamped in Shunem : and Saul gathered all Israel together , and they encamped in Gilboa .
when Saul saw the army of the Philistines , he was afraid , and his heart trembled greatly .
when Saul inquired of Yahweh , Yahweh didn 't answer him , neither by dreams , nor by Urim , nor by prophets .
the woman said to him , " behold , you know what Saul has done , how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land . why then do you lay a snare for my life , to cause me to die ? "
Saul swore to her by Yahweh , saying , " As Yahweh lives , no punishment shall happen to you for this thing . "
then the woman said , " whom shall I bring up to you ? " he said , " Bring Samuel up for me . "
when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice ; and the woman spoke to Saul , saying , " Why have you deceived me ? for you are Saul ! "
the king said to her , " Don 't be afraid . for what do you see ? " the woman said to Saul , " I see a god coming up out of the earth . "
Samuel said , " Why then do you ask of me , since Yahweh has departed from you and has become your adversary ?
Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me . Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand , and given it to your neighbor , even to David .
because you didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , and didn 't execute his fierce wrath on Amalek , therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day .
moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines ; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines . "
then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth , and was terrified , because of the words of Samuel . there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
the woman came to Saul , and saw that he was very troubled , and said to him , " behold , your handmaid has listened to your voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have listened to your words which you spoke to me .
now therefore , please listen also to the voice of your handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
but he refused , and said , I will not eat . but his servants , together with the woman , constrained him ; and he listened to their voice . so he arose from the earth , and sat on the bed .
the woman had a fattened calf in the house . she hurried and killed it ; and she took flour , and kneaded it , and baked unleavened bread of it .
she brought it before Saul , and before his servants ; and they ate . then they rose up , and went away that night .
now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek : and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel .
the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds , and by thousands ; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
therefore now return , and go in peace , that you not displease the lords of the Philistines . "
David said to Achish , " But what have I done ? what have you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day , that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king ? "
Achish answered David , " I know that you are good in my sight , as an angel of God . notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said , ' He shall not go up with us to the battle . '
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , depart . "
so David rose up early , he and his men , to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the Philistines . the Philistines went up to Jezreel .
it happened , when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South , and on Ziklag , and had struck Ziklag , and burned it with fire ,
and had taken captive the women and all who were therein , both small and great . they didn 't kill any , but carried them off , and went their way .
when David and his men came to the city , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captive .
then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
David 's two wives were taken captive , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite .
David was greatly distressed ; for the people spoke of stoning him , because the soul of all the people was grieved , every man for his sons and for his daughters : but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God .
they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he ate ; and they gave him water to drink .
they gave him a piece of a cake of figs , and two clusters of raisins. when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him ; for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
we made a raid on the South of the Cherethites , and on that which belongs to Judah , and on the South of Caleb ; and we burned Ziklag with fire . "
David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who rode on camels and fled .
David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken ; and David rescued his two wives .
there was nothing lacking to them , neither small nor great , neither sons nor daughters , neither spoil , nor anything that they had taken to them . David brought back all .
David took all the flocks and the herds , which they drove before those other livestock , and said , " This is David 's spoil . "
then David said , " You shall not do so , my brothers , with that which Yahweh has given to us , who has preserved us , and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand .
who will listen to you in this matter ? for as his share is who goes down to the battle , so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage : they shall share alike . "
it was so from that day forward , that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day .
when David came to Ziklag , he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah , even to his friends , saying , " behold , a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh . "
and to those who were in Racal , and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites , and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites ,
and to those who were in Hormah , and to those who were in Borashan , and to those who were in Athach ,
and to those who were in Hebron , and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay .
now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa .
the Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
the battle went hard against Saul , and the archers overtook him ; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers .
when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead , he likewise fell on his sword , and died with him .
so Saul died , and his three sons , and his armor bearer , and all his men , that same day together .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth ; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan .
when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul ,
all the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan ; and they came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
they took their bones , and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
it happened after the death of Saul , when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had stayed two days in Ziklag ;
it happened on the third day , that behold , a man came out of the camp from Saul , with his clothes torn , and earth on his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the earth , and showed respect .
David said to him , " Where do you come from ? " he said to him , " I have escaped out of the camp of Israel . "
David said to him , " How did it go ? please tell me . " he answered , " The people have fled from the battle , and many of the people also have fallen and are dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also . "
David said to the young man who told him , " How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead ? "
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa , behold , Saul was leaning on his spear ; and behold , the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him .
when he looked behind him , he saw me , and called to me . I answered , ' Here I am . '
he said to me , ' Who are you ? ' I answered him , ' I am an Amalekite . '
he said to me , ' Please stand beside me , and kill me ; for anguish has taken hold of me , because my life is yet whole in me . '
then David took hold on his clothes , and tore them ; and likewise all the men who were with him .
they mourned , and wept , and fasted until evening , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Yahweh , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
David said to the young man who told him , " Where are you from ? " he answered , " I am the son of a foreigner , an Amalekite . "
David said to him , " How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh 's anointed ? "
David called one of the young men , and said , " Go near , and fall on him . " he struck him , so that he died .
David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
( and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jashar ) :
" your glory , Israel , is slain on your high places ! how the mighty have fallen !
Don 't tell it in Gath . Don 't publish it in the streets of Ashkelon , lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph .
from the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , Jonathan 's bow didn 't turn back . Saul 's sword didn 't return empty .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives . in their death , they were not divided . they were swifter than eagles . they were stronger than lions .
you daughters of Israel , weep over Saul , who clothed you in scarlet delicately , who put ornaments of gold on your clothing .
how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle ! Jonathan is slain on your high places .
I am distressed for you , my brother Jonathan . you have been very pleasant to me . your love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
how are the mighty fallen , and the weapons of war perished ! "
so David went up there , and his two wives also , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite .
David brought up his men who were with him , every man with his household . they lived in the cities of Hebron .
the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . they told David , saying , " The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul . "
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead , and said to them , " blessed are you by Yahweh , that you have shown this kindness to your lord , even to Saul , and have buried him .
now may Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you . I also will reward you for this kindness , because you have done this thing .
now therefore let your hands be strong , and be valiant ; for Saul your lord is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them . "
now Abner the son of Ner , captain of Saul 's army , had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and brought him over to Mahanaim ;
Ishbosheth , Saul 's son , was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel , and he reigned two years . but the house of Judah followed David .
the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months .
Abner the son of Ner , and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul , went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon .
Joab the son of Zeruiah , and the servants of David , went out , and met them by the pool of Gibeon ; and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
Abner said to Joab , " Please let the young men arise and play before us ! " Joab said , " Let them arise ! "
then they arose and went over by number : twelve for Benjamin , and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and twelve of the servants of David .
they each caught his opponent by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
the battle was very severe that day : and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
the three sons of Zeruiah were there , Joab , and Abishai , and Asahel : and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle .
Asahel pursued after Abner ; and in going he didn 't turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
then Abner looked behind him , and said , " Is it you , Asahel ? " he answered , " It is I. "
Abner said to him , " Turn aside to your right hand or to your left , and grab one of the young men , and take his armor . " but Asahel would not turn aside from following him .
Abner said again to Asahel , " Turn aside from following me . why should I strike you to the ground ? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother ? "
but Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah , that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon .
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner , and became one band , and stood on the top of a hill .
Joab said , " As God lives , if you had not spoken , surely then in the morning the people would have gone away , and not each followed his brother . "
so Joab blew the trumpet ; and all the people stood still , and pursued after Israel no more , neither fought they any more .
Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah ; and they passed over the Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and came to Mahanaim .
Joab returned from following Abner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David 's servants nineteen men and Asahel .
but the servants of David had struck of Benjamin , and of Abner 's men , so that three hundred sixty men died .
they took up Asahel , and buried him in the tomb of his father , which was in Bethlehem . Joab and his men went all night , and the day broke on them at Hebron .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : and David grew stronger and stronger , but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker .
and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
and the sixth , Ithream , of Eglah , David 's wife . these were born to David in Hebron .
it happened , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul .
now Saul had a concubine , whose name was Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah : and Ishbosheth said to Abner , " Why have you gone in to my father 's concubine ? "
he could not answer Abner another word , because he feared him .
Ishbosheth sent , and took her from her husband , even from Paltiel the son of Laish .
her husband went with her , weeping as he went , and followed her to Bahurim . then Abner said to him , " Go ! return ! " and he returned .
Abner had communication with the elders of Israel , saying , " In times past , you sought for David to be king over you .
now then do it ; for Yahweh has spoken of David , saying , ' By the hand of my servant David , I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines , and out of the hand of all their enemies . ' "
Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
so Abner came to David to Hebron , and twenty men with him . David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast .
behold , the servants of David and Joab came from a foray , and brought in a great spoil with them : but Abner was not with David in Hebron ; for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
when Joab and all the army who was with him had come , they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he has sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
then Joab came to the king , and said , " What have you done ? behold , Abner came to you . why is it that you have sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
you know Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive you , and to know your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you do . "
when Joab had come out from David , he sent messengers after Abner , and they brought him back from the well of Sirah ; but David didn 't know it .
afterward , when David heard it , he said , " I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner .
so Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner , because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle .
David said to Joab , and to all the people who were with him , Tear your clothes , and clothe yourselves with sackcloth , and mourn before Abner . King David followed the Bier .
they buried Abner in Hebron : and the king lifted up his voice , and wept at the grave of Abner ; and all the people wept .
the king lamented for Abner , and said , " Should Abner die as a fool dies ?
your hands were not bound , nor your feet put into fetters . as a man falls before the children of iniquity , so you fell . " all the people wept again over him .
all the people took notice of it , and it pleased them ; as whatever the king did pleased all the people .
so all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner .
the king said to his servants , " Don 't you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel ?
I am this day weak , though anointed king ; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me . May Yahweh reward the evildoer according to his wickedness . "
when Saul 's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron , his hands became feeble , and all the Israelites were troubled .
and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim , and have lived as foreigners there until this day ) .
the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth , as he took his rest at noon .
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed , shall I not now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ? "
then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron , and spoke , saying , " behold , we are your bone and your flesh .
in times past , when Saul was king over us , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yahweh said to you , ' You shall be shepherd of my people Israel , and you shall be prince over Israel . ' "
so all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron ; and king David made a Covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh ; and they anointed David king over Israel .
David was thirty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years .
in Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months ; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty @-@ three years over all Israel and Judah .
nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion ; the same is the city of David .
David lived in the stronghold , and called it the city of David . David built around from Millo and inward .
David grew greater and greater ; for Yahweh , the God of Armies , was with him .
Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David , and cedar trees , and carpenters , and masons ; and they built David a house .
David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel 's sake .
David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem , after he had come from Hebron ; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David .
these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , and Nathan , and Solomon ,
and Elishama , and Eliada , and Eliphelet .
when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the stronghold .
now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
David inquired of Yahweh , saying , " shall I go up against the Philistines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? " Yahweh said to David , " Go up ; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand . "
they left their images there ; and David and his men took them away .
the Philistines came up yet again , and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
when David inquired of Yahweh , he said , " You shall not go up . circle around behind them , and attack them over against the mulberry trees .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall stir yourself up ; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
David did so , as Yahweh commanded him , and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer .
David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel , thirty thousand .
they set the Ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drove the new cart .
when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon , Uzzah reached for the Ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the cattle stumbled .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah ; and God struck him there for his error ; and there he died by the Ark of God .
David was displeased , because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah ; and he called that place Perez Uzzah , to this day .
David was afraid of Yahweh that day ; and he said , " How shall the Ark of Yahweh come to me ? "
so David would not move the Ark of Yahweh to be with him in the city of David ; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
the Ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite three months : and Yahweh blessed Obed @-@ Edom , and all his house .
it was so , that , when those who bore the Ark of Yahweh had gone six paces , he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf .
David danced before Yahweh with all his might ; and David was clothed in a linen ephod .
so David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of Yahweh with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet .
it was so , as the Ark of Yahweh came into the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh ; and she despised him in her heart .
they brought in the Ark of Yahweh , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies .
he gave to all the people , even among the whole multitude of Israel , both to men and women , to everyone a portion of bread , dates , and raisins . so all the people departed everyone to his house .
I will be yet more vile than this , and will be base in my own sight . but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken , they shall honor me . "
Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death .
it happened , when the king lived in his house , and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around ,
that the king said to Nathan the prophet , " See now , I dwell in a house of cedar , but the Ark of God dwells within curtains . "
Nathan said to the king , " Go , do all that is in your heart ; for Yahweh is with you . "
it happened the same night , that the word of Yahweh came to Nathan , saying ,
" go and tell my servant David , ' Thus says Yahweh , " shall you build me a house for me to dwell in ?
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle .
now therefore you shall tell my servant David this , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " I took you from the sheep pen , from following the sheep , that you should be prince over my people , over Israel .
I have been with you wherever you went , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a great name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sleep with your fathers , I will set up your seed after you , who shall proceed out of your bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
he shall build a house for my name , and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commits iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men ;
but my loving kindness shall not depart from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before you .
your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you . your throne shall be established forever . " ' "
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so Nathan spoke to David .
then David the king went in , and sat before Yahweh ; and he said , " Who am I , Lord Yahweh , and what is my house , that you have brought me thus far ?
what more can David say to you ? for you know your servant , Lord Yahweh .
for your word 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make your servant know it .
therefore you are great , Yahweh God . for there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
you established for yourself your people Israel to be a people to you forever ; and you , Yahweh , became their God .
now , Yahweh God , the word that you have spoken concerning your servant , and concerning his house , confirm it forever , and do as you have spoken .
let your name be magnified forever , saying , ' Yahweh of Armies is God over Israel ; and the house of your servant David shall be established before you . '
for you , Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , have revealed to your servant , saying , ' I will build you a house . ' therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you .
" now , O Lord Yahweh , you are God , and your words are truth , and you have promised this good thing to your servant .
now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant , that it may continue forever before you ; for you , Lord Yahweh , have spoken it . let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing . "
after this it happened that David struck the Philistines , and subdued them : and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines .
he struck Moab , and measured them with the line , making them to lie down on the ground ; and he measured two lines to put to death , and one full line to keep alive . the Moabites became servants to David , and brought tribute .
David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob , king of Zobah , as he went to recover his dominion at the River .
David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen : and David hamstrung all the chariot horses , but reserved of them for one hundred chariots .
when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men .
then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus ; and the Syrians became servants to David , and brought tribute . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went .
David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
from Betah and from Berothai , cities of Hadadezer , king David took exceeding much brass .
when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer ,
David earned a reputation when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt , even Eighteen thousand men .
he put garrisons in Edom ; throughout all Edom put he garrisons , and all the Edomites became servants to David . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went .
David reigned over all Israel ; and David executed justice and righteousness to all his people .
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder ;
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , were priests ; and Seraiah was scribe ;
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and David 's sons were chief ministers .
David said , " Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul , that I may show him kindness for Jonathan 's sake ? "
the king said to him , " Where is he ? " Ziba said to the king , " behold , he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , in Lo Debar . "
then king David sent , and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , from Lo Debar .
Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , came to David , and fell on his face , and showed respect . David said , " Mephibosheth . " he answered , " behold , your servant ! "
he bowed down , and said , " What is your servant , that you should look on such a dead dog as I am ? "
then the king called to Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said to him , " All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master 's son .
then Ziba said to the king , " According to all that my lord the king commands his servant , so your shall servant do . " so Mephibosheth ate at the king 's table , like one of the king 's sons .
Mephibosheth had a young son , whose name was Mica . all that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth .
so Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem ; for he ate continually at the king 's table . he was lame in both his feet .
it happened after this , that the king of the children of Ammon died , and Hanun his son reigned in his place .
so Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
when they told it to David , he sent to meet them ; for the men were greatly ashamed . the king said , " wait at Jericho until your beards have grown , and then return . "
when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David , the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob , and the Syrians of Zobah , twenty thousand footmen , and the king of Maacah with one thousand men , and the men of Tob twelve thousand men .
when David heard of it , he sent Joab , and all the army of the mighty men .
the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate : and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob , and the men of Tob and Maacah , were by themselves in the field .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians :
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother ; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God ; and Yahweh do that which seems good to him . "
so Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians : and they fled before him .
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai , and entered into the city . then Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
when the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel , they gathered themselves together .
Hadadezer sent , and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River : and they came to Helam , with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came to Helam . the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed of the Syrians seven hundred charioteers , and forty thousand horsemen , and struck Shobach the captain of their army , so that he died there .
it happened at evening , that David arose from off his bed , and walked on the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he saw a woman bathing ; and the woman was very beautiful to look on .
David sent and inquired after the woman . one said , " Isn 't this Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah the Hittite ? "
David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in to him , and he lay with her ( for she was purified from her uncleanness ) ; and she returned to her house .
the woman conceived ; and she sent and told David , and said , " I am with child . "
David sent to Joab , " Send me Uriah the Hittite . " Joab sent Uriah to David .
when Uriah had come to him , David asked of him how Joab did , and how the people fared , and how the war prospered .
David said to Uriah , " Go down to your house , and wash your feet . " Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
but Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and didn 't go down to his house .
when they had told David , saying , " Uriah didn 't go down to his house , " David said to Uriah , " haven 't you come from a journey ? why didn 't you go down to your house ? "
David said to Uriah , " Stay here today also , and tomorrow I will let you depart . " so Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day , and the next day .
when David had called him , he ate and drink before him ; and he made him drunk . at evening , he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but didn 't go down to his house .
it happened in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Joab , and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
he wrote in the letter , saying , " Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle , and retreat from him , that he may be struck , and die . "
it happened , when Joab kept watch on the city , that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were .
the men of the city went out , and fought with Joab . some of the people fell , even of the servants of David ; and Uriah the Hittite died also .
then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war ;
and he commanded the messenger , saying , " When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king ,
it shall be that , if the king 's wrath arise , and he asks you , ' Why did you go so near to the city to fight ? Didn 't you know that they would shoot from the wall ?
so the messenger went , and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for .
the messenger said to David , " The men prevailed against us , and came out to us into the field , and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate .
the shooters shot at your servants from off the wall ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also . "
when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead , she made lamentation for her husband .
Yahweh sent Nathan to David . he came to him , and said to him , " There were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
the rich man had very many flocks and herds ,
David 's anger was greatly kindled against the man , and he said to Nathan , " As Yahweh lives , the man who has done this is worthy to die !
he shall restore the lamb fourfold , because he did this thing , and because he had no pity ! "
Nathan said to David , " You are the man . this is what Yahweh , the God of Israel , says : ' I anointed you king over Israel , and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul .
I gave you your master 's house , and your master 's wives into your bosom , and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that would have been too little , I would have added to you many more such things .
why have you despised the word of Yahweh , to do that which is evil in his sight ? you have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and have taken his wife to be your wife , and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon .
now therefore the sword will never depart from your house , because you have despised me , and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife . '
" this is what Yahweh says : ' behold , I will raise up evil against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wives before your eyes , and give them to your neighbor , and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun .
for you did it secretly , but I will do this thing before all Israel , and before the sun . ' "
David said to Nathan , " I have sinned against Yahweh . " Nathan said to David , " Yahweh also has put away your sin . you will not die .
however , because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh 's enemies to blaspheme , the child also who is born to you shall surely die . "
Nathan departed to his house . Yahweh struck the child that Uriah 's wife bore to David , and it was very sick .
David therefore begged God for the child ; and David fasted , and went in , and lay all night on the earth .
the elders of his house arose beside him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
but when David saw that his servants were whispering together , David perceived that the child was dead ; and David said to his servants , " Is the child dead ? " they said , " He is dead . "
then his servants said to him , " What is this that you have done ? you fasted and wept for the child while he was alive ; but when the child was dead , you rose up and ate bread . "
he said , " While the child was yet alive , I fasted and wept ; for I said , ' Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me , that the child may live ? '
but now he is dead , why should I fast ? can I bring him back again ? I shall go to him , but he will not return to me . "
now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and took the royal city .
Joab sent messengers to David , and said , " I have fought against Rabbah . yes , I have taken the city of waters .
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and encamp against the city , and take it ; lest I take the city , and it be called after my name . "
David gathered all the people together , and went to Rabbah , and fought against it , and took it .
he took the crown of their king from off his head ; and its weight was a talent of gold , and in it were precious stones ; and it was set on David 's head . he brought out the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
it happened after this , that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister , whose name was Tamar ; and Amnon the son of David loved her .
Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar ; for she was a virgin ; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her .
but Amnon had a friend , whose name was Jonadab , the son of Shimeah , David 's brother ; and Jonadab was a very subtle man .
so Amnon lay down and faked being sick . when the king came to see him , Amnon said to the king , " Please let my sister Tamar come , and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat from her hand . "
then David sent home to Tamar , saying , " Go now to your brother Amnon 's house , and prepare food for him . "
so Tamar went to her brother Amnon 's house ; and he was laid down . she took dough , and kneaded it , and made cakes in his sight , and baked the cakes .
she took the pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . Amnon said , " Have all men leave me . " every man went out from him .
Amnon said to Tamar , " Bring the food into the room , that I may eat from your hand . " Tamar took the cakes which she had made , and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother .
when she had brought them near to him to eat , he took hold of her , and said to her , " Come , lie with me , my sister ! "
she answered him , " No , my brother , do not force me ! for no such thing ought to be done in Israel . Don 't you do this Folly .
however he would not listen to her voice ; but being stronger than she , he forced her , and lay with her .
then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred ; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her . Amnon said to her , " arise , be gone ! "
she said to him , " Not so , because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me ! " but he would not listen to her .
then he called his servant who ministered to him , and said , " Put now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her . "
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were virgins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
Tamar put ashes on her head , and tore her garment of various colors that was on her ; and she laid her hand on her head , and went her way , crying aloud as she went .
but when king David heard of all these things , he was very angry .
Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad ; for Absalom hated Amnon , because he had forced his sister Tamar .
it happened after two full years , that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor , which is beside Ephraim : and Absalom invited all the king 's sons .
Absalom came to the king , and said , " See now , your servant has sheepshearers . please let the king and his servants go with your servant . "
the king said to Absalom , " No , my son , let us not all go , lest we be burdensome to you . " he pressed him ; however he would not go , but blessed him .
then Absalom said , " If not , please let my brother Amnon go with us . " the king said to him , " Why should he go with you ? "
but Absalom pressed him , and he let Amnon and all the king 's sons go with him .
the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man got up on his mule , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Absalom has slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
then the king arose , and tore his garments , and lay on the earth ; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn .
now therefore don 't let my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead ; for Amnon only is dead . "
but Absalom fled . the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold , many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him .
Jonadab said to the king , " behold , the king 's sons are coming ! it is as your servant said . "
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and wept . the king also and all his servants wept bitterly .
but Absalom fled , and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur , king of Geshur . David mourned for his son every day .
King David longed to go forth to Absalom : for he was comforted concerning Amnon , since he was dead .
go in to the king , and speak like this to him . " so Joab put the words in her mouth .
when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , showed respect , and said , " Help , O king ! "
the king said to her , " What ails you ? " she answered , " Truly I am a widow , and my husband is dead .
your handmaid had two sons , and they both fought together in the field , and there was no one to part them , but the one struck the other , and killed him .
the king said to the woman , " Go to your house , and I will give a command concerning you . "
the woman of Tekoa said to the king , " My lord , O king , the iniquity be on me , and on my father 's house ; and the king and his throne be guiltless . "
the king said , " Whoever says anything to you , bring him to me , and he shall not touch you any more . "
then the woman said , " Please let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king . " he said , " Say on . "
now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and your handmaid said , ' I will now speak to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant . '
for the king will hear , to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
then your handmaid said , ' Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest ; for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad . May Yahweh , your God , be with you . ' "
then the king answered the woman , " Please don 't hide anything from me that I ask you . " the woman said , " Let my lord the king now speak . "
to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing . my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . "
the king said to Joab , " behold now , I have done this thing . go therefore , bring the young man Absalom back . "
Joab fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and blessed the king . Joab said , " Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight , my lord , king , in that the king has performed the request of his servant . "
so Joab arose and went to Geshur , and brought Absalom to Jerusalem .
the king said , " Let him return to his own house , but let him not see my face . " so Absalom returned to his own house , and didn 't see the king 's face .
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
when he cut the hair of his head ( now it was at every year 's end that he cut it ; because it was heavy on him , therefore he cut it ) ; he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels , after the king 's weight .
to Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a beautiful face .
Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem ; and he didn 't see the king 's face .
then Absalom sent for Joab , to send him to the king ; but he would not come to him : and he sent again a second time , but he would not come .
therefore he said to his servants , " behold , Joab 's field is near mine , and he has barley there . go and set it on fire . " Absalom 's servants set the field on fire .
then Joab arose , and came to Absalom to his house , and said to him , " Why have your servants set my field on fire ? "
so Joab came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
it happened after this , that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses , and fifty men to run before him .
Absalom said to him , " behold , your matters are good and right ; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you . "
Absalom said moreover , " Oh that I were made judge in the land , that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me , and I would do him justice ! "
it was so , that when any man came near to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took hold of him , and kissed him .
Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment . so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
it happened at the end of forty years , that Absalom said to the king , " Please let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed to Yahweh , in Hebron .
two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem , who were invited , and went in their simplicity ; and they didn 't know anything .
Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David 's counselor , from his city , even from Giloh , while he was offering the sacrifices . the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Absalom .
a messenger came to David , saying , " The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom . "
the king 's servants said to the king , " behold , your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses . "
the king went forth , and all his household after him . the king left ten women , who were concubines , to keep the house .
the king went forth , and all the people after him ; and they stayed in Beth Merhak .
all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , six hundred men who came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
then the king said to Ittai the Gittite , " Why do you also go with us ? return , and stay with the king ; for you are a foreigner , and also an exile . return to your own place .
Ittai answered the king , and said , " As Yahweh lives , and as my lord the king lives , surely in what place my lord the king shall is , whether for death or for life , even there also will your servant be . "
David said to Ittai , " Go and pass over . " Ittai the Gittite passed over , and all his men , and all the little ones who were with him .
all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Brook Kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
behold , Zadok also came , and all the Levites with him , bearing the Ark of the Covenant of God ; and they set down the Ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people finished passing out of the city .
the king said to Zadok , " Carry back the Ark of God into the city . if I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh , he will bring me again , and show me both it , and his habitation ;
but if he say thus , ' I have no delight in you ; ' behold , here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to him . "
behold , I will stay at the fords of the wilderness , until word comes from you to inform me . "
Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the Ark of God again to Jerusalem ; and they stayed there .
David went up by the ascent of the Mount of olives , and wept as he went up ; and he had his head covered , and went barefoot : and all the people who were with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
it happened that when David had come to the top , where God was worshiped , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn , and earth on his head .
David said to him , " If you pass on with me , then you will be a burden to me ;
Don 't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you ? therefore it shall be , that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king 's house , you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz , Zadok 's son , and Jonathan , Abiathar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
so Hushai , David 's friend , came into the city ; and Absalom came into Jerusalem .
then the king said to Ziba , " behold , all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours . " Ziba said , " I do obeisance . let me find favor in your sight , my lord , O king . "
when king David came to Bahurim , behold , a man of the family of the house of Saul came out , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera . he came out , and Cursed still as he came .
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
Shimei said when he Cursed , " Be gone , be gone , you man of blood , and base fellow !
then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king , " Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? please let me go over and take off his head . "
it may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me , and that Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today . "
so David and his men went by the way ; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him , and Cursed as he went , threw stones at him , and threw dust .
the king , and all the people who were with him , came weary ; and he refreshed himself there .
it happened , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , had come to Absalom , that Hushai said to Absalom , " Long live the king ! long live the king ! "
Absalom said to Hushai , " Is this your kindness to your friend ? why didn 't you go with your friend ? "
Hushai said to Absalom , " No ; but whomever Yahweh , and this people , and all the men of Israel have chosen , his will I be , and with him I will stay .
again , whom should I serve ? Shouldn 't I serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in your father 's presence , so will I be in your presence . "
then Absalom said to Ahithophel , " Give your counsel what we shall do . "
so they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house ; and Absalom went in to his father 's concubines in the sight of all Israel .
the counsel of Ahithophel , which he gave in those days , was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God : so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom .
moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom , " Let me now choose twelve thousand men , and I will arise and pursue after David tonight .
I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted , and will make him afraid . all the people who are with him shall flee . I will strike the king only ;
and I will bring back all the people to you . the man whom you seek is as if all returned . all the people shall be in peace . "
the saying pleased Absalom well , and all the elders of Israel .
then Absalom said , " Now call Hushai the Archite also , and let us hear likewise what he says . "
when Hushai had come to Absalom , Absalom spoke to him , saying , " Ahithophel has spoken like this . shall we do what he says ? if not , speak up . "
Hushai said to Absalom , " The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good . "
even he who is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will utterly melt ; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man , and those who are with him are valiant men .
but I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you , from Dan even to Beersheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that you go to battle in your own person .
so shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground ; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there isn 't one small stone found there . "
Absalom and all the men of Israel said , " The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel . " for Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel , to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom .
then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , " Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way ; and I have counseled this way .
the woman took and spread the covering over the well 's mouth , and spread out bruised grain on it ; and nothing was known .
then David arose , and all the people who were with him , and they passed over the Jordan . by the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan .
when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his donkey , and arose , and went home , to his city , and set his house in order , and hanged himself ; and he died , and was buried in the tomb of his father .
then David came to Mahanaim . Absalom passed over the Jordan , he and all the men of Israel with him .
Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab . now Amasa was the son of a man , whose name was Ithra the Israelite , who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah , Joab 's mother .
Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead .
David numbered the people who were with him , and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them .
the king said to them , " I will do what seems best to you . " the king stood beside the gate , and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands .
the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , " Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom . " all the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom .
so the people went out into the field against Israel : and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim .
the people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David , and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men .
for the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country ; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured .
a certain man saw it , and told Joab , and said , " behold , I saw Absalom hanging in an oak . "
Joab said to the man who told him , " behold , you saw it , and why didn 't you strike him there to the ground ? I would have given you ten pieces of silver , and a sash . "
otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life ( and there is no matter hidden from the king ) , then you yourself would have set yourself against me . "
then Joab said , " I 'm not going to wait like this with you . " he took three darts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Absalom , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
ten young men who bore Joab 's armor surrounded and struck Absalom , and killed him .
Joab blew the trumpet , and the people returned from pursuing after Israel ; for Joab held back the people .
they took Absalom , and cast him into the great pit in the forest , and raised over him a very great heap of stones . then all Israel fled everyone to his tent .
then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said , " Let me now run , and bear the king news , how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies . "
Joab said to him , " You shall not be the bearer of news this day , but you shall bear news another day . but today you shall bear no news , because the king 's son is dead . "
then Joab said to the Cushite , " Go , tell the king what you have seen ! " the Cushite bowed himself to Joab , and ran .
" but come what may , " he said , " I will run . " he said to him , " Run ! " then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain , and outran the Cushite .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
the watchman cried , and told the king . the king said , " If he is alone , there is news in his mouth . " he came closer and closer .
the watchman saw another man running ; and the watchman called to the Porter , and said , " behold , a man running alone ! " the king said , " He also brings news . "
the king said , " Turn aside , and stand here . " he turned aside , and stood still .
behold , the Cushite came . the Cushite said , " News for my lord the king ; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you . "
it was told Joab , " behold , the king weeps and mourns for Absalom . "
the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people ; for the people heard it said that day , " The king grieves for his son . "
the people sneaked into the city that day , as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle .
the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , " My son Absalom , Absalom , my son , my son ! "
Joab came into the house to the king , and said , " You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants , who this day have saved your life , and the lives of your sons and of your daughters , and the lives of your wives , and the lives of your concubines ;
Absalom , whom we anointed over us , is dead in battle . now therefore why don 't you speak a word of bringing the king back ? "
you are my brothers , you are my bone and my flesh . why then are you the last to bring back the king ? '
he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Return , you and all your servants . "
so the king returned , and came to the Jordan . Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to bring the king over the Jordan .
Shimei the son of Gera , the Benjamite , who was of Bahurim , hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David .
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
for your servant knows that I have sinned . therefore behold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king . "
but Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered , " shall Shimei not be put to death for this , because he Cursed Yahweh 's anointed ? "
the king said to Shimei , " You shall not die . " the king swore to him .
Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king ; and he had neither groomed his feet , nor trimmed his beard , nor washed his clothes , from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace .
it happened , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Why didn 't you go with me , Mephibosheth ? "
he has slandered your servant to my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of God . do therefore what is good in your eyes .
the king said to him , " Why do you speak any more of your matters ? I say , you and Ziba divide the land . "
Mephibosheth said to the king , " Yes , let him take all , because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house . "
Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim ; and he went over the Jordan with the king , to conduct him over the Jordan .
now Barzillai was a very aged man , even eighty years old : and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
the king said to Barzillai , " Come over with me , and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem . "
Barzillai said to the king , " How many are the days of the years of my life , that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem ?
your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king . why should the king repay me with such a reward ?
the king answered , " Chimham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you . whatever you require of me , that I will do for you . "
all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . then the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned to his own place .
so the king went over to Gilgal , and Chimham went over with him . all the people of Judah brought the king over , and also half the people of Israel .
so all the men of Israel went up from following David , and followed Sheba the son of Bichri ; but the men of Judah joined with their king , from the Jordan even to Jerusalem .
then the king said to Amasa , " Call me the men of Judah together within three days , and be here present . "
so Amasa went to call the men of Judah together ; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men ; and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
Joab said to Amasa , " Is it well with you , my brother ? " Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him .
there stood by him one of Joab 's young men , and said , " He who favors Joab , and he who is for David , let him follow Joab ! "
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Joab , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel , and to Beth Maacah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then a wise woman cried out of the city , " Hear , hear ! please say to Joab , ' Come near here , that I may speak with you . ' "
then she spoke , saying , " They were used to say in old times , ' They shall surely ask counsel at Abel ; ' and so they settled it .
Joab answered , " Far be it , far be it from me , that I should swallow up or destroy .
now Joab was over all the army of Israel ; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites ;
and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder ;
and Sheva was scribe ; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests ;
and David said to the Gibeonites , " What shall I do for you ? and with what shall I make Atonement , that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh ? "
but the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of Yahweh 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
but the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bore to Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite .
he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites , and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh , and all seven of them fell together . they were put to death in the days of harvest , in the first days , at the beginning of barley harvest .
it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , the concubine of Saul , had done .
and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son : and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged .
they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela , in the tomb of Kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . after that God was entreated for the land .
the Philistines had war again with Israel ; and David went down , and his servants with him , and fought against the Philistines . David grew faint ;
it came to pass after this , that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph , who was of the sons of the giant .
there was again war with the Philistines at Gob ; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite 's brother , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
there was again war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , who had on every hand six fingers , and on every foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
when he defied Israel , Jonathan the son of Shimei , David 's brother , killed him .
these four were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
and he said , " Yahweh is my rock , my fortress , and my deliverer , even mine ;
God , my rock , in him I will take refuge ; my shield , and the Horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge . my Savior , you save me from violence .
I will call on Yahweh , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from my enemies .
for the waves of death surrounded me . the floods of ungodliness made me afraid .
the cords of Sheol were around me . the snares of death caught me .
in my distress I called on Yahweh . yes , I called to my God . he heard my voice out of his temple . my cry came into his ears .
then the earth shook and trembled . the foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken , because he was angry .
smoke went up out of his nostrils . fire out of his mouth devoured . Coals were kindled by it .
he bowed the heavens also , and came down . thick darkness was under his feet .
he rode on a cherub , and flew . yes , he was seen on the wings of the wind .
he made darkness pavilions around himself : gathering of waters , and thick clouds of the skies .
at the brightness before him , coals of fire were kindled .
Yahweh thundered from heaven . the Most High uttered his voice .
he sent out arrows , and scattered them ; lightning , and confused them .
then the channels of the sea appeared . the foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh , At the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
he sent from on high and he took me . he drew me out of many waters .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , from those who hated me , for they were too mighty for me .
they came on me in the day of my calamity , but Yahweh was my support .
he also brought me out into a large place . he delivered me , because he delighted in me .
Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness . he rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands .
for I have kept the ways of Yahweh , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
for all his ordinances were before me . as for his statutes , I did not depart from them .
I was also perfect toward him . I kept myself from my iniquity .
therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness , According to my cleanness in his eyesight .
with the merciful you will show yourself merciful . with the perfect man you will show yourself perfect .
with the pure you will show yourself pure . with the crooked you will show yourself shrewd .
you will save the afflicted people , But your eyes are on the haughty , that you may bring them down .
for you are my lamp , Yahweh . Yahweh will light up my darkness .
for by you , I run against a troop . by my God , I leap over a wall .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yahweh is tested . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
for who is God , besides Yahweh ? who is a rock , besides our God ?
God is my strong fortress . he makes my way perfect .
he makes his feet like hinds ' feet , and sets me on my high places .
he teaches my hands to war , so that my arms bend a bow of brass .
you have also given me the shield of your salvation . your gentleness has made me great .
you have enlarged my steps under me . my feet have not slipped .
I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them . I didn 't turn again until they were consumed .
I have consumed them , and struck them through , so that they can 't arise . yes , they have fallen under my feet .
for you have armed me with strength for the battle . you have subdued under me those who rose up against me .
you have also made my enemies turn their backs to me , that I might cut off those who hate me .
they looked , but there was none to save ; even to Yahweh , but he didn 't answer them .
then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth . I crushed them as the mire of the streets , and spread them abroad .
you also have delivered me from the strivings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
the foreigners will submit themselves to me . as soon as they hear of me , they will obey me .
the foreigners will fade away , and will come trembling out of their close places .
Yahweh lives ! blessed be my rock ! Exalted be God , the rock of my salvation ,
even the God who executes vengeance for me , who brings down peoples under me ,
who brings me away from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
therefore I will give thanks to you , Yahweh , among the nations . will sing praises to your name .
he gives great deliverance to his king , and shows loving kindness to his anointed , to David and to his seed , forevermore . "
now these are the last words of David . David the son of Jesse says , the man who was raised on high says , the anointed of the God of Jacob , the sweet psalmist of Israel :
" the Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me . his word was on my tongue .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spoke to me , ' One who rules over men righteously , who rules in the fear of God ,
shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun rises , a morning without clouds , when the tender grass springs out of the earth , through clear shining after rain . '
but all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away , because they can 't be taken with the hand ,
but the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear . they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place . "
these are the names of the mighty men whom David had : Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite , chief of the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite , against eight hundred slain at one time .
after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite . the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of lentils ; and the people fled from the Philistines .
but he stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Philistines ; and Yahweh worked a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam ; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
David longed , and said , " Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! "
the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but he would not drink of it , but poured it out to Yahweh .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Wasn 't he most honorable of the three ? therefore he was made their captain : however he didn 't attain to the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
he killed an Egyptian , a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and killed him with his own spear .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things , and had a name among the three mighty men .
he was more honorable than the thirty , but he didn 't attain to the three . David set him over his guard .
Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty ; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem ,
Helez the Paltite , IRA the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite ,
Abiezer the Anathothite , Mebunnai the Hushathite ,
Zalmon the Ahohite , Maharai the Netophathite ,
Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite , Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin ,
Benaiah a Pirathonite , Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash .
Eliahba the Shaalbonite , the sons of Jashen , Jonathan ,
Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai , the son of the Maacathite , Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite ,
Hezro the Carmelite , Paarai the Arbite ,
Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah , Bani the Gadite ,
Zelek the Ammonite , Naharai the Beerothite , armor bearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah ,
IRA the Ithrite , Gareb the Ithrite ,
Uriah the Hittite : thirty @-@ seven in all .
again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he moved David against them , saying , " Go , number Israel and Judah . "
the king said to Joab the captain of the army , who was with him , " Now go back and forth through all the tribes of Israel , from Dan even to Beersheba , and number the people , that I may know the sum of the people . "
notwithstanding , the king 's word prevailed against Joab , and against the captains of the army . Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
and came to the stronghold of Tyre , and to all the cities of the Hivites , and of the Canaanites ; and they went out to the south of Judah , at Beersheba .
so when they had gone back and forth through all the land , they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
David said to Gad , " I am in distress . let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh ; for his mercies are great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
so Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time ; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men .
Gad came that day to David , and said to him , " Go up , build an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite . "
David went up according to the saying of Gad , as Yahweh commanded .
Araunah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Araunah said to David , " Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . behold , the cattle for the burnt offering , and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood :
all this , king , does Araunah give to the king . " Araunah said to the king , " May Yahweh your God accept you . "
David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . so Yahweh was entreated for the land , and the plague was stayed from Israel .
now king David was old and stricken in years ; and they covered him with clothes , but he couldn 't keep warm .
therefore his servants said to him , " Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin . let her stand before the king , and cherish him ; and let her lie in your bosom , that my lord the king may keep warm . "
so they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel , and found Abishag the Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
the young lady was very beautiful ; and she cherished the king , and ministered to him ; but the king didn 't know her intimately .
then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , " I will be king . " then he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , " Why have you done so ? " and he was also a very handsome man ; and he was born after Absalom .
he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah , and with Abiathar the priest : and they following Adonijah helped him .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men who belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon , saying , " haven 't you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns , and David our lord doesn 't know it ?
now therefore come , please let me give you counsel , that you may save your own life , and the life of your son Solomon .
go in to king David , and tell him , ' Didn 't you , my lord , king , swear to your handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ? why then does Adonijah reign ? '
behold , while you yet talk there with the king , I also will come in after you , and confirm your words . "
Bathsheba went in to the king into the room . the king was very old ; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king .
Bathsheba bowed , and showed respect to the king . the king said , " What would you like ? "
she said to him , " My lord , you swore by Yahweh your God to your handmaid , ' Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne . '
now , behold , Adonijah reigns ; and you , my lord the king , don 't know it .
he has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the army ; but he hasn 't called Solomon your servant .
you , my lord the king , the eyes of all Israel are on you , that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
otherwise it will happen , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders . "
behold , while she yet talked with the king , Nathan the prophet came in .
they told the king , saying , " behold , Nathan the prophet ! " when he had come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Nathan said , " My lord , king , have you said , ' Adonijah shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ? '
but he hasn 't called me , even me your servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and your servant Solomon .
then king David answered , " Call to me Bathsheba . " she came into the king 's presence , and stood before the king .
the king swore , and said , " As Yahweh lives , who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity ,
most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh , the God of Israel , saying , ' Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne in my place ; ' most certainly so will I do this day . "
then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth , and showed respect to the king , and said , " Let my lord king David live forever ! "
King David said , " Call to me Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada . " they came before the king .
the king said to them , " Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule , and bring him down to Gihon .
let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel . blow the trumpet , and say , ' Long live king Solomon ! '
then you shall come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my throne ; for he shall be king in my place . I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah . "
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king , and said , " Amen . May Yahweh , the God of my lord the king , say so .
as Yahweh has been with my lord the king , even so may he be with Solomon , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David . "
so Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
Zadok the priest took the Horn of oil out of the tent , and anointed Solomon . they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , " Long live king Solomon ! "
all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth shook with their sound .
Jonathan answered Adonijah , " Most certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king .
the king has sent with him Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and they have caused him to ride on the king 's mule .
also , Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom .
moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , ' May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and make his throne greater than your throne ; ' and the king bowed himself on the bed .
also thus said the king , ' blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , who has given one to sit on my throne this day , my eyes even seeing it . ' "
all the guests of Adonijah were afraid , and rose up , and each man went his way .
Adonijah feared because of Solomon ; and he arose , and went , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
Solomon said , " If he shows himself a worthy man , not a hair of him shall fall to the earth ; but if wickedness be found in him , he shall die . "
so king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . he came and bowed down to king Solomon ; and Solomon said to him , " Go to your house . "
now the days of David drew near that he should die ; and he commanded Solomon his son , saying ,
" I am going the way of all the earth . you be strong therefore , and show yourself a man ;
do therefore according to your wisdom , and don 't let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace .
but show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be of those who eat at your table ; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother .
now therefore don 't hold him guiltless , for you are a wise man ; and you will know what you ought to do to him , and you shall bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood . "
David slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David .
the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years ; he reigned seven years in Hebron , and he reigned thirty @-@ three years in Jerusalem .
Solomon sat on the throne of David his father ; and his kingdom was firmly established .
then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon . she said , " Do you come peaceably ? " he said , " Peaceably .
now I ask one petition of you . Don 't deny me . " she said to him , " Say on . "
he said , " Please speak to Solomon the king ( for he will not tell you ' no ' ) , that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife . "
Bathsheba said , " Alright . I will speak for you to the king . "
she said , " Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife . "
then king Solomon swore by Yahweh , saying , " God do so to me , and more also , if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life .
King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he fell on him , so that he died .
so Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh , that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh , which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
the news came to Joab ; for Joab had turned after Adonijah , though he didn 't turn after Absalom . Joab fled to the tent of Yahweh , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
it was told king Solomon , " Joab has fled to the tent of Yahweh , and behold , he is by the altar . " then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , " Go , fall on him . "
so shall their blood return on the head of Joab , and on the head of his seed forever . but to David , and to his seed , and to his house , and to his throne , there shall be peace forever from Yahweh . "
then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up , and fell on him , and killed him ; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army ; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar .
the king sent and called for Shimei , and said to him , " Build yourself a house in Jerusalem , and dwell there , and don 't go out from there anywhere .
for on the day you go out , and pass over the Brook Kidron , know for certain that you shall surely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
Shimei said to the king , " The saying is good . as my lord the king has said , so will your servant do . " Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days .
it happened at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish , son of Maacah , king of Gath . they told Shimei , saying , " behold , your servants are in Gath . "
Shimei arose , and saddled his donkey , and went to Gath to Achish , to seek his servants ; and Shimei went , and brought his servants from Gath .
it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath , and had come again .
why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh , and the commandment that I have instructed you with ? "
the king said moreover to Shimei , " You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to , that you did to David my father . therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head .
but king Solomon shall be blessed , and the throne of David shall be established before Yahweh forever . "
so the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he went out , and fell on him , so that he died . the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon .
only the people sacrificed in the high places , because there was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days .
Solomon loved Yahweh , walking in the statutes of David his father : only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place . Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar .
in Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night ; and God said , " Ask what I shall give you . "
now , Yahweh my God , you have made your servant king instead of David my father . I am but a little child . I don 't know how to go out or come in .
your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen , a great people , that can 't be numbered nor counted for multitude .
give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people , that I may discern between good and evil ; for who is able to judge this your great people ? "
the speech pleased the Lord , that Solomon had asked this thing .
I have also given you that which you have not asked , both riches and honor , so that there shall not be any among the kings like you , all your days .
if you will walk in my ways , to keep my statutes and my commandments , as your father David walked , then I will lengthen your days . "
Solomon awoke ; and behold , it was a dream . then he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and offered up burnt offerings , offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
then two women who were prostitutes came to the king , and stood before him .
the one woman said , " Oh , my lord , I and this woman dwell in one house . I delivered a child with her in the house .
it happened the third day after I delivered , that this woman delivered also . we were together . there was no stranger with us in the house , just us two in the house .
this woman 's child died in the night , because she lay on it .
she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while your handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
when I rose in the morning to nurse my child , behold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , whom I bore . "
then the king said , " The one says , ' This is my son who lives , and your son is the dead ; ' and the other says , ' No ; but your son is the dead one , and my son is the living one . ' "
the king said , " Get me a sword . " they brought a sword before the king .
the king said , " Divide the living child in two , and give half to the one , and half to the other . "
then the king answered , " Give her the living child , and in no way kill it . she is its mother . "
King Solomon was king over all Israel .
these were the princes whom he had : Azariah the son of Zadok , the priest ;
Elihoreph and Ahijah , the sons of Shisha , scribes ; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud , the recorder ;
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army ; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests ;
and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers ; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister , the king 's friend ;
and Ahishar was over the household ; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor .
Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel , who provided food for the king and his household : each man had to make provision for a month in the year .
these are their names : Ben Hur , in the hill country of Ephraim ;
Ben Deker , in Makaz , and in Shaalbim , and Beth Shemesh , and Elon Beth Hanan ;
Ben Hesed , in Arubboth ( to him belonged Socoh , and all the land of Hepher ) ;
Ben Abinadab , in all the height of Dor ( he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife ) ;
Baana the son of Ahilud , in Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan , beneath Jezreel , from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah , as far as beyond Jokmeam ;
Ben Geber , in Ramoth Gilead ( to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh , which are in Gilead ; to him belonged the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars ) ;
Ahinadab the son of Iddo , in Mahanaim ;
Ahimaaz , in Naphtali ( he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife ) ;
Baana the son of Hushai , in Asher and Bealoth ;
Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah , in Issachar ;
Shimei the son of Ela , in Benjamin ;
Geber the son of Uri , in the land of Gilead , the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking and making merry .
Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines , and to the border of Egypt : they brought tribute , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
Solomon 's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour , and sixty measures of meal ,
ten head of fat cattle , and twenty head of cattle out of the pastures , and one hundred sheep , besides harts , and gazelles , and roebucks , and fattened fowl .
for he had dominion over all on this side the River , from Tiphsah even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side the River : and he had peace on all sides around him .
Judah and Israel lived safely , every man under his vine and under his fig tree , from Dan even to Beersheba , all the days of Solomon .
Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen .
those officers provided food for king Solomon , and for all who came to king Solomon 's table , every man in his month ; they let nothing be lacking .
barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where the officers were , every man according to his duty .
God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much , and very great understanding , even as the sand that is on the seashore .
Solomon 's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east , and all the wisdom of Egypt .
for he was wiser than all men ; than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , and Calcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol : and his fame was in all the nations all around .
he spoke three thousand Proverbs ; and his songs were one thousand five .
he spoke of trees , from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall ; he spoke also of animals , and of birds , and of creeping things , and of fish .
there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the earth , who had heard of his wisdom .
Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon ; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father : for Hiram was ever a lover of David .
Solomon sent to Hiram , saying ,
" you know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Yahweh his God for the wars which were about him on every side , until Yahweh put them under the soles of his feet .
but now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side . there is neither adversary , nor evil occurrence .
it happened , when Hiram heard the words of Solomon , that he rejoiced greatly , and said , " blessed is Yahweh this day , who has given to David a wise son over this great people . "
Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , " I have heard the message which you have sent to me . I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar , and concerning timber of fir .
so Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire .
Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of pure oil . Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year .
Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom , as he promised him ; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon ; and they two made a treaty together .
King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel ; and the levy was thirty thousand men .
he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses ; a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home ; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor .
Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens , and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains ;
besides Solomon 's chief officers who were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , who bore rule over the people who labored in the work .
the king commanded , and they cut out great stones , costly stones , to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone .
Solomon 's builders and Hiram 's builders and the Gebalites cut them , and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house .
it happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Ziv , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of Yahweh .
the house which king Solomon built for Yahweh , its length was sixty cubits , and its breadth twenty , and its height thirty cubits .
the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubits was its length , according to the breadth of the house . ten cubits was its breadth before the house .
for the house he made windows of fixed lattice work .
against the wall of the house he built stories all around , against the walls of the house all around , both of the temple and of the oracle ; and he made side rooms all around .
the nethermost story was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad ; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around , that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quarry ; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house : and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story , and out of the middle into the third .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar .
he built the stories against all the house , each five cubits high : and they rested on the house with timber of cedar .
the word of Yahweh came to Solomon , saying ,
" concerning this house which you are building , if you will walk in my statutes , and execute my ordinances , and keep all my commandments to walk in them ; then will I establish my word with you , which I spoke to David your father .
I will dwell among the children of Israel , and will not forsake my people Israel . "
so Solomon built the house , and finished it .
he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar : from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling , he covered them on the inside with wood ; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir .
in front of the temple sanctuary was forty cubits .
there was cedar on the house within , carved with buds and open flowers : all was cedar ; there was no stone seen .
he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within , to set there the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh .
within the oracle was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in its height ; and he overlaid it with pure gold : and he covered the altar with cedar .
so Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold : and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle ; and he overlaid it with gold .
the whole house he overlaid with gold , until all the house was finished : also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold .
in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood , each ten cubits high .
five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
the other cherub was ten cubits : both the cherubim were of one measure and one form .
the height of the one cherub was ten cubits , and so was it of the other cherub .
he set the cherubim within the inner house ; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall ; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house .
he overlaid the cherubim with gold .
he carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers , inside and outside .
the floor of the house he overlaid with gold , inside and outside .
for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood : the lintel and door posts were a fifth part of the wall .
so he made two doors of olive wood ; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers , and overlaid them with gold ; and he spread the gold on the cherubim , and on the palm trees .
so also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood , out of a fourth part of the wall ;
and two doors of fir wood : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
he built the inner court with three courses of cut stone , and a course of cedar beams .
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid , in the month Ziv .
in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all its parts , and according to all its fashion . so was he seven years in building it .
Solomon was building his own house thirteen years , and he finished all his house .
it was covered with cedar above over the forty @-@ five beams , that were on the pillars ; fifteen in a row .
there were beams in three rows , and window was over against window in three ranks .
all the doors and posts were made square with beams : and window was over against window in three ranks .
he made the porch of pillars ; its length was fifty cubits , and its breadth thirty cubits ; and a porch before them ; and pillars and a threshold before them .
he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge , even the porch of judgment : and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor .
his house where he was to dwell , the other court within the porch , was of the like work . he made also a house for Pharaoh 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this porch .
the foundation was of costly stones , even great stones , stones of ten cubits , and stones of eight cubits .
above were costly stones , even cut stone , according to measure , and cedar wood .
the great court around had three courses of cut stone , and a course of cedar beams ; like as the inner court of the house of Yahweh , and the porch of the house .
King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre .
for he fashioned the two pillars of brass , Eighteen cubits high apiece : and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them about .
he made two capitals of molten brass , to set on the tops of the pillars : the height of the one capital was five cubits , and the height of the other capital was five cubits .
there were nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ; seven for the one capital , and seven for the other capital .
the capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of Lily work , four cubits .
there were capitals above also on the two pillars , close by the belly which was beside the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred , in rows around on the other capital .
he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called its name Jachin ; and he set up the left pillar , and called its name Boaz .
on the top of the pillars was Lily work : so was the work of the pillars finished .
he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it .
under its brim around there were buds which encircled it , for ten cubits , encircling the sea : the buds were in two rows , cast when it was cast .
it stood on twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
it was a handbreadth thick : and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup , like the flower of a Lily : it held two thousand baths .
he made the ten bases of brass ; four cubits was the length of one base , and four cubits its breadth , and three cubits its height .
the work of the bases was like this : they had panels ; and there were panels between the ledges ;
and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubim ; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above ; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work .
every base had four bronze wheels , and axles of brass ; and the four feet of it had supports : beneath the basin were the supports molten , with wreaths at the side of each .
the four wheels were underneath the panels ; and the axles of the wheels were in the base : and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit .
the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their axles , and their rims , and their spokes , and their naves , were all molten .
there were four supports at the four corners of each base : its supports were of the base itself .
in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high ; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same .
on the plates of its stays , and on its panels , he engraved cherubim , lions , and palm trees , according to the space of each , with wreaths all around .
in this way , he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one form .
he made ten basins of brass : one basin contained forty baths ; and every basin was four cubits ; and on every one of the ten bases one basin .
he set the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward , toward the south .
Hiram made the basins , and the shovels , and the basins . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh :
the two pillars , and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ;
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars ;
and the ten bases , and the ten basins on the bases ;
and the one sea , and the twelve oxen under the sea ;
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basins : even all these vessels , which Hiram made for king Solomon , in the house of Yahweh , were of burnished brass .
the king cast them in the plain of the Jordan , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan .
Solomon left all the vessels unweighed , because they were exceeding many : the weight of the brass could not be found out .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh : the golden altar , and the table whereupon the show bread was , of gold ;
and the lampstands , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the oracle , of pure gold ; and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , of gold ;
and the cups , and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the fire pans , of pure gold ; and the hinges , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , of the temple , of gold .
thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yahweh was finished . Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated , the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , and put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the princes of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel , to king Solomon in Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David , which is Zion .
all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast , in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
all the elders of Israel came , and the priests took up the Ark .
they brought up the Ark of Yahweh , and the tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent ; even these the priests and the Levites brought up .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , who were assembled to him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh to its place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubim .
for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark , and the cherubim covered the Ark and its poles above .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there they are to this day .
there was nothing in the Ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb , when Yahweh made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
it came to pass , when the priests had come out of the holy place , that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh ,
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud ; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh .
then Solomon said , " Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness .
I have surely built you a house of habitation , a place for you to dwell in forever . "
the king turned his face about , and blessed all the assembly of Israel : and all the assembly of Israel stood .
he said , " blessed is Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David your father , and has with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
" now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
but Yahweh said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart .
nevertheless , you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
Yahweh has established his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and I sit on the throne of Israel , as Yahweh promised , and have built the house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
there I have set a place for the Ark , in which is the Covenant of Yahweh , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ;
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
" now therefore , God of Israel , please let your word be verified , which you spoke to your servant David my father .
but will God in very deed dwell on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain you ; how much less this house that I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and for his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which you have said , ' My name shall be there ; ' to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place .
listen to the supplication of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place . yes , hear in heaven , your dwelling place ; and when you hear , forgive .
" if a man sins against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swear before your altar in this house ;
then hear in heaven , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way on his own head , and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
" when your people Israel are struck down before the enemy , because they have sinned against you ; if they turn again to you , and confess your name , and pray and make supplication to you in this house :
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you afflict them :
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
" if there is famine in the land , if there is pestilence , if there is blight , mildew , locust or caterpillar ; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities ; whatever plague , whatever sickness there is ;
whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall each know the plague of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear in heaven , your dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of all the children of men ; )
that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers .
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
( for they shall hear of your great name , and of your mighty hand , and of your outstretched arm ) ; when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
" if your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name ;
then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their cause .
if they sin against you ( for there is no man who doesn 't sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy , far off or near ;
yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive , saying , ' We have sinned , and have done perversely ; we have dealt wickedly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies , who carried them captive , and pray to you toward their land , which you gave to their fathers , the city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name :
then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven , your dwelling place , and maintain their cause ;
and forgive your people who have sinned against you , and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you ; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them
( for they are your people , and your inheritance , which you brought out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron ) ;
that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant , and to the supplication of your people Israel , to listen to them whenever they cry to you .
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh , he arose from before the altar of Yahweh , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven .
he stood , and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice , saying ,
" blessed be Yahweh , who has given rest to his people Israel , according to all that he promised . there has not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by Moses his servant .
May Yahweh our God be with us , as he was with our fathers . let him not leave us , nor forsake us ;
that he may incline our hearts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his ordinances , which he commanded our fathers .
let these my words , with which I have made supplication before Yahweh , be near to Yahweh our God day and night , that he may maintain the cause of his servant , and the cause of his people Israel , as every day shall require ;
that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh , he is God . there is none else .
" let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day . "
the king , and all Israel with him , offered sacrifice before Yahweh .
Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered to Yahweh , two and twenty thousand head of cattle , and one hundred twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh .
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
that Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time , as he had appeared to him at Gibeon .
as for you , if you will walk before me , as David your father walked , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel . '
but if you turn away from following me , you or your children , and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you , but shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Yahweh and the king 's house
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they didn 't please him .
he said , " What cities are these which you have given me , my brother ? " he called them the land of Cabul to this day .
Hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold .
Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
Solomon built Gezer , and Beth Horon the lower ,
and Baalath , and Tamar in the wilderness , in the land ,
and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and the cities for his chariots , and the cities for his horsemen , and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people who were left of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
these were the chief officers who were over Solomon 's work , five hundred fifty , who bore rule over the people who labored in the work .
but Pharaoh 's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her : then he built Millo .
King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .
Hiram sent in the navy his servants , sailors who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
they came to Ophir , and fetched from there gold , four hundred and twenty talents , and brought it to king Solomon .
when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Yahweh , she came to prove him with hard questions .
she came to Jerusalem with a very great train , with camels that bore spices , and very much gold , and precious stones ; and when she had come to Solomon , she talked with him of all that was in her heart .
Solomon told her all her questions : there was not anything hidden from the king which he didn 't tell her .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
however I didn 't believe the words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it . behold , the half was not told me ! your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard .
happy are your men , happy are these your servants , who stand continually before you , who hear your wisdom .
the navy also of Hiram , that brought gold from Ophir , brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty @-@ six talents of gold ,
besides that which the traders brought , and the traffic of the merchants , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the governors of the country .
King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold ; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler .
moreover the king made a great throne of Ivory , and overlaid it with the finest gold .
there were six steps to the throne , and the top of the throne was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any kingdom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
for the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram : once every three years came the navy of Tarshish , bringing gold , and silver , Ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
so king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom .
all the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
they brought every man his tribute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clothing , and armor , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , that he bestowed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt ; and the king 's merchants received them in droves , each drove at a price .
a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and a horse for one hundred fifty ; and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
now king Solomon loved many foreign women , together with the daughter of Pharaoh , women of the Moabites , Ammonites , Edomites , Sidonians , and Hittites ;
he had seven hundred wives , princesses , and three hundred concubines ; and his wives turned away his heart .
for it happened , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods ; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God , as was the heart of David his father .
for Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians , and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites .
Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and didn 't go fully after Yahweh , as did David his father .
then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab , on the mountain that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon .
so he did for all his foreign wives , who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods .
therefore Yahweh said to Solomon , " Because this is done by you , and you have not kept my Covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded you , I will surely tear the kingdom from you , and will give it to your servant .
notwithstanding I will not do it in your days , for David your father 's sake ; but I will tear it out of the hand of your son .
however I will not tear away all the kingdom ; but I will give one tribe to your son , for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen . "
Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon , Hadad the Edomite : he was of the king 's seed in Edom .
for it happened , when David was in Edom , and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain , and had struck every male in Edom
( for Joab and all Israel remained there six months , until he had cut off every male in Edom ) ;
that Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt , Hadad being yet a little child .
they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran ; and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , to Pharaoh king of Egypt , who gave him a house , and appointed him food , and gave him land .
Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh 's house ; and Genubath was in Pharaoh 's house among the sons of Pharaoh .
when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the army was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , " Let me depart , that I may go to my own country . "
God raised up an adversary to him , Rezon the son of Eliada , who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah .
he gathered men to him , and became captain over a troop , when David killed them of Zobah : and they went to Damascus , and lived therein , and reigned in Damascus .
he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon , besides the mischief of Hadad : and he abhorred Israel , and reigned over Syria .
Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephraimite of Zeredah , a servant of Solomon , whose mother 's name was Zeruah , a widow , he also lifted up his hand against the king .
this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Millo , and repaired the breach of the city of David his father .
the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor ; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious , and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph .
it happened at that time , when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him , and tore it in twelve pieces .
he said to Jeroboam , " Take ten pieces ; for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' behold , I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to you
( but he shall have one tribe , for my servant David 's sake and for Jerusalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel ) ;
but I will take the kingdom out of his son 's hand , and will give it to you , even ten tribes .
to his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
I will take you , and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires , and shall be king over Israel .
I will for this afflict the seed of David , but not forever . ' "
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam ; but Jeroboam arose , and fled into Egypt , to Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , aren 't they written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years .
Solomon slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David his father : and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place .
Rehoboam went to Shechem : for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king .
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam lived in Egypt ,
and they sent and called him ) , that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came , and spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
" your father made our yoke grievous : now therefore make you the grievous service of your father , and his heavy yoke which he put on us , lighter , and we will serve you . "
he said to them , " depart for three days , then come back to me . " the people departed .
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
they spoke to him , saying , " If you will be a servant to this people this day , and will serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Thus you shall tell this people who spoke to you , saying , ' Your father made our yoke heavy , but make it lighter to us ; ' you shall say to them , ' My little finger is thicker than my father 's waist .
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with Scorpions . ' "
so Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king asked , saying , " Come to me again the third day . "
so the king didn 't listen to the people ; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh , that he might establish his word , which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
but as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
so Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day .
it happened , when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned , that they sent and called him to the Congregation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none who followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only .
" speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and to the rest of the people , saying ,
then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and lived in it ; and he went out from there , and built Penuel .
Jeroboam said in his heart , " Now the kingdom will return to the house of David .
if this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord , even to Rehoboam king of Judah ; and they will kill me , and return to Rehoboam king of Judah . "
he set the one in Bethel , and the other put he in Dan .
this thing became a sin ; for the people went to worship before the one , even to Dan .
he made houses of high places , and made priests from among all the people , who were not of the sons of Levi .
behold , there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth El : and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense .
the altar also was split apart , and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Yahweh .
the king said to the man of God , " Come home with me , and refresh yourself , and I will give you a reward . "
the man of God said to the king , " Even if you gave me half of your house , I would not go in with you , neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place ;
for so was it commanded me by the word of Yahweh , saying , ' You shall eat no bread , nor drink water , neither return by the way that you came . ' "
so he went another way , and didn 't return by the way that he came to Bethel .
now there lived an old prophet in Bethel ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
their father said to them , " Which way did he go ? " now his sons had seen which way the man of God went , who came from Judah .
he said to his sons , " Saddle the donkey for me . " so they saddled the donkey for him ; and he rode on it .
then he said to him , " Come home with me , and eat bread . "
he said , " I may not return with you , nor go in with you ; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place .
for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
so he went back with him , and ate bread in his house , and drank water .
it happened , as they sat at the table , that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back ;
and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah , saying , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Because you have been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh , and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you ,
but came back , and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you , " eat no bread , and drink no water " ; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers . ' "
it happened , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the donkey stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
behold , men passed by , and saw the body cast in the way , and the lion standing by the body ; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived .
the prophet took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the donkey , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn , and to bury him .
he laid his body in his own grave ; and they mourned over him , saying , " Alas , my brother ! "
it happened , after he had buried him , that he spoke to his sons , saying , " When I am dead , then bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried . lay my bones beside his bones .
for the saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against the altar in Bethel , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria , will surely happen . "
this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth .
at that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick .
take with you ten loaves , and cakes , and a jar of honey , and go to him . he will tell you what will become of the child . "
Jeroboam 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . now Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
go , tell Jeroboam , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : " because I exalted you from among the people , and made you prince over my people Israel ,
and tore the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it you ; and yet you have not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in my eyes ,
but have done evil above all who were before you , and have gone and made you other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and have cast me behind your back :
he who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Yahweh has spoken it . " '
arise therefore , and go to your house . when your feet enter into the city , the child shall die .
moreover Yahweh will raise him up a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam . this is day ! what ? even now .
he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , which he has sinned , and with which he has made Israel to sin . "
Jeroboam 's wife arose , and departed , and came to Tirzah . as she came to the threshold of the house , the child died .
all Israel buried him , and mourned for him , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet .
the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years : and he slept with his fathers , and Nadab his son reigned in his place .
Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed , above all that their fathers had done .
for they also built them high places , and pillars , and Asherim , on every high hill , and under every green tree ;
and there were also sodomites in the land : they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel .
it happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem ;
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king went into the house of Yahweh , the guard bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and his mother 's name was Naamah the Ammonitess . Abijam his son reigned in his place .
now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah .
he reigned three years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom .
he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him ; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God , as the heart of David his father .
nevertheless for David 's sake , Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem ;
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and didn 't turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life .
the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
Abijam slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in the city of David : and ASA his son reigned in his place .
in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began ASA to reign over Judah .
he reigned forty @-@ one years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom .
ASA did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , as did David his father .
he put away the sodomites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen , because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah ; and ASA cut down her image , and burnt it at the Brook Kidron .
but the high places were not taken away : nevertheless the heart of ASA was perfect with Yahweh all his days .
he brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
there was war between ASA and Baasha king of Israel all their days .
Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to ASA king of Judah .
Ben Hadad listened to king ASA , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck Ijon , and Dan , and Abel Beth Maacah , and all Chinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and lived in Tirzah .
then king ASA made a proclamation to all Judah ; none was exempted : and they carried away the stones of Ramah , and its timber , with which Baasha had built ; and king ASA built therewith Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of ASA king of Judah ; and he reigned over Israel two years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon .
even in the third year of ASA king of Judah , Baasha killed him , and reigned in his place .
for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger .
now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
there was war between ASA and Baasha king of Israel all their days .
in the third year of ASA king of Judah , Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah for twenty @-@ four years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
the word of Yahweh came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha , saying ,
" because I exalted you out of the dust , and made you prince over my people Israel , and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam , and have made my people Israel to sin , to provoke me to anger with their sins ;
behold , I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house ; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
the dogs will eat Baasha 's descendants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Baasha slept with his fathers , and was buried in Tirzah ; and Elah his son reigned in his place .
in the twenty @-@ sixth year of ASA king of Judah , Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah for two years .
his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him . now he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , who was over the household in Tirzah :
and Zimri went in and struck him , and killed him , in the twenty @-@ seventh year of ASA king of Judah , and reigned in his place .
it happened , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he struck all the house of Baasha : he didn 't leave him a single one who urinates on a wall , neither of his relatives , nor of his friends .
now the rest of the acts of Elah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the twenty @-@ seventh year of ASA king of Judah , Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah . now the people were encamped against Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines .
the people who were encamped heard say , Zimri has conspired , and has also struck the king : therefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the army , king over Israel that day in the camp .
Omri went up from Gibbethon , and all Israel with him , and they besieged Tirzah .
it happened , when Zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the castle of the king 's house , and burnt the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his treason that he committed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
but the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath : so Tibni died , and Omri reigned .
in the thirty @-@ first year of ASA king of Judah , Omri began to reign over Israel for twelve years . he reigned six years in Tirzah .
Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and dealt wickedly above all who were before him .
for he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin , to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger with their vanities .
now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he showed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
so Omri slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria ; and Ahab his son reigned in his place .
in the thirty @-@ eighth year of ASA king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel : and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty @-@ two years .
Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh above all that were before him .
it happened , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians , and went and served Baal , and worshiped him .
he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal , which he had built in Samaria .
Ahab made the Asherah ; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
the word of Yahweh came to him , saying ,
" go away from here , turn eastward , and hide yourself by the Brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
it shall be , that you shall drink of the Brook . I have commanded the ravens to feed you there . "
so he went and did according to the word of Yahweh ; for he went and lived by the Brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drank of the Brook .
it happened after a while , that the Brook dried up , because there was no rain in the land .
the word of Yahweh came to him , saying ,
" arise , go to Zarephath , which belongs to Sidon , and stay there . behold , I have commanded a widow there to sustain you . "
as she was going to get it , he called to her , and said , " Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand . "
Elijah said to her , " Don 't be afraid . go and do as you have said ; but make me of it a little cake first , and bring it out to me , and afterward make some for you and for your son .
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' The jar of meal shall not empty , neither shall the jar of oil fail , until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth . ' "
she went and did according to the saying of Elijah : and she , and he , and her house , ate many days .
the jar of meal didn 't empty , neither did the jar of oil fail , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by Elijah .
it happened after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so severe , that there was no breath left in him .
he said to her , " Give me your son . " he took him out of her bosom , and carried him up into the room where he stayed , and laid him on his own bed .
he cried to Yahweh , and said , " Yahweh my God , have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I stay , by killing her son ? "
he stretched himself on the child three times , and cried to Yahweh , and said , " Yahweh my God , please let this child 's soul come into him again . "
Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Elijah said , " behold , your son lives . "
the woman said to Elijah , " Now I know that you are a man of God , and that the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth . "
it happened after many days , that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah , in the third year , saying , " Go , show yourself to Ahab ; and I will send rain on the earth . "
Elijah went to show himself to Ahab . the famine was severe in Samaria .
Ahab called Obadiah , who was over the household . ( now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly :
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh , that Obadiah took one hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it : Ahab went one way by himself , and Obadiah went another way by himself .
as Obadiah was in the way , behold , Elijah met him : and he recognized him , and fell on his face , and said , " Is it you , my lord Elijah ? "
he answered him , " It is I. Go , tell your lord , ' behold , Elijah is here ! ' "
he said , " Wherein have I sinned , that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab , to kill me ?
now you say , ' Go , tell your lord , " behold , Elijah is here . " '
Wasn 't it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh , how I hid one hundred men of Yahweh 's prophets with fifty to a cave , and fed them with bread and water ?
now you say , ' Go , tell your lord , " behold , Elijah is here " ; ' and he will kill me . "
Elijah said , " As Yahweh of Armies lives , before whom I stand , I will surely show myself to him today . "
so Obadiah went to meet Ahab , and told him ; and Ahab went to meet Elijah .
it happened , when Ahab saw Elijah , that Ahab said to him , " Is that you , you troubler of Israel ? "
so Ahab sent to all the children of Israel , and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel .
then Elijah said to the people , " I , even I only , am left a prophet of Yahweh ; but Baal 's prophets are four hundred fifty men .
Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , " Choose one bull for yourselves , and dress it first ; for you are many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it . "
they cried aloud , and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances , until the blood gushed out on them .
it was so , when midday was past , that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
Elijah said to all the people , " Come near to me " ; and all the people came near to him . he repaired the altar of Yahweh that was thrown down .
Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , to whom the word of Yahweh came , saying , " Israel shall be your name . "
with the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh . he made a trench around the altar , large enough to contain two measures of seed .
he put the wood in order , and cut the bull in pieces , and laid it on the wood . he said , " fill four jars with water , and pour it on the burnt offering , and on the wood . "
he said , " Do it a second time " ; and they did it the second time . he said , " Do it a third time " ; and they did it the third time .
the water ran around the altar ; and he also filled the trench with water .
hear me , Yahweh , hear me , that this people may know that you , Yahweh , are God , and that you have turned their heart back again . "
then the fire of Yahweh fell , and consumed the burnt offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces . they said , " Yahweh , he is God ! Yahweh , he is God ! "
Elijah said to them , " seize the prophets of Baal ! Don 't let one of them escape ! " they seized them . Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon , and killed them there .
Elijah said to Ahab , " Get up , eat and drink ; for there is the sound of abundance of rain . "
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he bowed himself down on the earth , and put his face between his knees .
it happened in a little while , that the sky grew black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . Ahab rode , and went to Jezreel .
the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah ; and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel .
Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done , and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword .
when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Beersheba , which belongs to Judah , and left his servant there .
he lay down and slept under a juniper tree ; and behold , an angel touched him , and said to him , " arise and eat ! "
he looked , and behold , there was at his head a cake baked on the coals , and a jar of water . he ate and drank , and lay down again .
the angel of Yahweh came again the second time , and touched him , and said , " arise and eat , because the journey is too great for you . "
he arose , and ate and drank , and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the Mount of God .
he came there to a cave , and lodged there ; and behold , the word of Yahweh came to him , and he said to him , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
after the earthquake a fire passed ; but Yahweh was not in the fire : and after the fire a still small voice .
it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . behold , a voice came to him , and said , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
it shall happen , that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael , Jehu will kill ; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu , Elisha will kill .
yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel , all the knees which have not bowed to Baal , and every mouth which has not kissed him . "
Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together ; and there were thirty @-@ two kings with him , and horses and chariots : and he went up and besieged Samaria , and fought against it .
he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel , into the city , and said to him , " Thus says Ben Hadad ,
'Your silver and your gold is mine . your wives also and your children , even the best , are mine . ' "
the king of Israel answered , " It is according to your saying , my lord , O king . I am yours , and all that I have . "
the messengers came again , and said , " Ben Hadad says , ' I sent indeed to you , saying , " You shall deliver me your silver , and your gold , and your wives , and your children ;
but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time , and they shall search your house , and the houses of your servants ; and it shall be , that whatever is pleasant in your eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away . " ' "
all the elders and all the people said to him , " Don 't listen , neither consent . "
the king of Israel answered , " Tell him , ' Don 't let him who puts on his armor brag like he who takes it off . ' "
then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty @-@ two . after them , he mustered all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
they went out at noon . but Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions , he and the kings , the thirty @-@ two kings who helped him .
the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first ; and Ben Hadad sent out , and they told him , saying , " Men are coming out from Samaria . "
he said , " If they have come out for peace , take them alive ; or if they have come out for war , take them alive . "
so these went out of the city , the young men of the princes of the provinces , and the army which followed them .
they each killed his man . the Syrians fled , and Israel pursued them . Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen .
the king of Israel went out , and struck the horses and chariots , and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter .
the servants of the king of Syria said to him , " Their god is a god of the hills ; therefore they were stronger than we . but let us fight against them in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they .
do this thing : take the kings away , every man out of his place , and put captains in their place .
it happened at the return of the year , that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
they encamped one over against the other seven days . so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined ; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the Syrians in one day .
but the rest fled to Aphek , into the city ; and the wall fell on twenty @-@ seven thousand men who were left . Ben Hadad fled , and came into the city , into an inner room .
a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh , " Please strike me ! " the man refused to strike him .
then he found another man , and said , " Please strike me . " the man struck him , smiting and wounding him .
so the prophet departed , and waited for the king by the way , and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes .
as your servant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " So your judgment shall be ; you yourself have decided it . "
he hurried , and took the headband away from his eyes ; and the king of Israel recognized that he was of the prophets .
the king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry , and came to Samaria .
Naboth said to Ahab , " May Yahweh forbid me , that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you ! "
but Jezebel his wife came to him , and said to him , " Why is your spirit so sad , that you eat no bread ? "
Jezebel his wife said to him , " Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel ? arise , and eat bread , and let your heart be merry . I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite . "
so she wrote letters in Ahab 's name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city , who lived with Naboth .
set two men , base fellows , before him , and let them testify against him , saying , ' You Cursed God and the king ! ' then carry him out , and stone him to death . "
the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city , did as Jezebel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
they proclaimed a fast , and set Naboth on high among the people .
then they sent to Jezebel , saying , " Naboth has been stoned , and is dead . "
it happened , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
the word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
" arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who dwells in Samaria . behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
behold , I will bring evil on you , and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall , and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger , and have made Israel to sin . "
Yahweh also spoke of Jezebel , saying , " The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel .
the dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city ; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field . "
but there was none like Ahab , who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , whom Jezebel his wife stirred up .
he did very abominably in following idols , according to all that the Amorites did , whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
it happened , when Ahab heard those words , that he tore his clothes , and put sackcloth on his flesh , and fasted , and lay in sackcloth , and went softly .
the word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel .
it happened in the third year , that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel .
he said to Jehoshaphat , " Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead ? " Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , " I am as you are , my people as your people , my horses as your horses . "
Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , " Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh . "
but Jehoshaphat said , " Isn 't there here a prophet of Yahweh , that we may inquire of him ? "
then the king of Israel called an officer , and said , " quickly get Micaiah the son of Imlah . "
now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron , and said , " Thus says Yahweh , ' With these you shall push the Syrians , until they are consumed . ' "
all the prophets prophesied so , saying , " Go up to Ramoth Gilead , and prosper ; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king . "
Micaiah said , " As Yahweh lives , what Yahweh says to me , that I will speak . "
the king said to him , " How many times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh ? "
he said , " I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd . Yahweh said , ' These have no master . let them each return to his house in peace . ' "
the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , " Didn 't I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me , but evil ? "
Micaiah said , " Therefore hear the word of Yahweh . I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne , and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left .
Yahweh said , ' Who shall entice Ahab , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead ? ' one said one thing ; and another said another .
a spirit came out and stood before Yahweh , and said , ' I will entice him . '
now therefore , behold , Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets ; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you . "
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you ? "
Micaiah said , " behold , you will see on that day , when you go into an inner room to hide yourself . "
the king of Israel said , " Take Micaiah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son .
say , ' Thus says the king , " Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace . " ' "
Micaiah said , " If you return at all in peace , Yahweh has not spoken by me . " he said , " listen , all you people ! "
so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead .
the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty @-@ two captains of his chariots , saying , Fight neither with small nor great , except only with the king of Israel .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " surely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . Jehoshaphat cried out .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a certain man drew his bow at random , and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor . therefore he said to the driver of his chariot , " Turn your hand , and carry me out of the battle ; for I am severely wounded . "
the battle increased that day . the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians , and died at evening . the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot .
a cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun , saying , " Every man to his city , and every man to his country ! "
so the king died , and was brought to Samaria ; and they buried the king in Samaria .
they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves ; according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke .
now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the Ivory house which he built , and all the cities that he built , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
so Ahab slept with his fathers ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place .
Jehoshaphat the son of ASA began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel .
Jehoshaphat was thirty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ five years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
he walked in all the way of ASA his father ; He didn 't turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he showed , and how he warred , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
the remnant of the sodomites , that remained in the days of his father ASA , he put away out of the land .
there was no king in Edom : a deputy was king .
Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold : but they didn 't go ; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber .
then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , " Let my servants go with your servants in the ships . " but Jehoshaphat would not .
Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father ; Jehoram his son reigned in his place .
Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and he reigned two years over Israel .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , in which he made Israel to sin .
he served Baal , and worshiped him , and provoked to anger Yahweh , the God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab .
but the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite , " arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria , and tell them , ' Is it because there is no God in Israel , that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub , the god of Ekron ?
now therefore thus says Yahweh , " You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up , but shall surely die . " ' " Elijah departed .
the messengers returned to him , and he said to them , " Why is it that you have returned ? "
he said to them , " What kind of man was he who came up to meet you , and told you these words ? "
they answered him , " He was a hairy man , and wearing a leather belt around his waist . " he said , " It is Elijah the Tishbite . "
then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him . he went up to him ; and behold , he was sitting on the top of the hill . he said to him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' Come down ! ' "
again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty . he answered him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' Come down quickly ! ' "
behold , fire came down from the sky , and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties . but now let my life be precious in your sight . "
the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah , " Go down with him . Don 't be afraid of him . " he arose , and went down with him to the king .
so he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken . Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah ; because he had no son .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
it happened , when Yahweh would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven , that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal .
fifty men of the sons of the prophets went , and stood opposite them at a distance ; and they both stood by the Jordan .
Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and struck the waters , and they were divided here and there , so that they two went over on dry ground .
he said , " You have asked a hard thing . if you see me when I am taken from you , it shall be so for you ; but if not , it shall not be so . "
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that behold , a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
Elisha saw it , and he cried , " My father , my father , the chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! " he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and tore them in two pieces .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and struck the waters , and said , " Where is Yahweh , the God of Elijah ? " when he also had struck the waters , they were divided here and there ; and Elisha went over .
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
when they urged him until he was ashamed , he said , " Send them . " they sent therefore fifty men ; and they searched for three days , but didn 't find him .
they came back to him , while he stayed at Jericho ; and he said to them , " Didn 't I tell you , ' Don 't go ? ' "
the men of the city said to Elisha , " behold , please , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord sees ; but the water is bad , and the land miscarries . "
he said , " Bring me a new jar , and put salt in it . " they brought it to him .
he went out to the spring of the waters , and threw salt into it , and said , " Thus says Yahweh , ' I have healed these waters . there shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying . ' "
so the waters were healed to this day , according to the word of Elisha which he spoke .
he went up from there to Bethel . as he was going up by the way , some youths came out of the city and mocked him , and said to him , " Go up , you baldy ! go up , you baldhead ! "
he looked behind him and saw them , and Cursed them in the name of Yahweh . two female bears came out of the woods , and mauled forty @-@ two of those youths .
he went from there to Mount Carmel , and from there he returned to Samaria .
now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and reigned twelve years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , but not like his father , and like his mother ; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made .
nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder ; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs , and of one hundred thousand rams .
but it happened , when Ahab was dead , that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time , and mustered all Israel .
he said , " Which way shall we go up ? " he answered , " The way of the wilderness of Edom . "
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom ; and they made a circuit of seven days ' journey . there was no water for the army , nor for the animals that followed them .
the king of Israel said , " Alas ! for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab . "
Jehoshaphat said , " The word of Yahweh is with him . " so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
Elisha said , " As Yahweh of Armies lives , before whom I stand , surely , were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , I would not look toward you , nor see you .
but now bring me a minstrel . " it happened , when the minstrel played , that the hand of Yahweh came on him .
he said , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Make this valley full of trenches . '
for thus says Yahweh , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your livestock and your animals .
this is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh . he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand .
you shall strike every fortified city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all springs of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones . ' "
it happened in the morning , about the time of offering the offering , that behold , water came by the way of Edom , and the country was filled with water .
now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , they gathered themselves together , all who were able to put on armor , and upward , and stood on the border .
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone on the water , and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood .
they said , " This is blood . the kings are surely destroyed , and they have struck each other . now therefore , Moab , to the spoil ! "
when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites , so that they fled before them ; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites .
when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword , to break through to the king of Edom ; but they could not .
then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place , and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall . there was great wrath against Israel : and they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
then he said , " Go , borrow containers from of all your neighbors , even empty containers . Don 't borrow just a few .
you shall go in , and shut the door on you and on your sons , and pour out into all those containers ; and you shall set aside that which is full . "
so she went from him , and shut the door on her and on her sons ; they brought the containers to her , and she poured out .
it fell on a day , that Elisha passed to Shunem , where there was a prominent woman ; and she persuaded him to eat bread . so it was , that as often as he passed by , he turned in there to eat bread .
she said to her husband , " See now , I perceive that this is a holy man of God , that passes by us continually .
please let us make a little room on the wall . let us set for him there a bed , a table , a chair , and a lamp stand . it shall be , when he comes to us , that he shall turn in there . "
one day he came there , and he turned into the room and lay there .
he said to Gehazi his servant , " Call this Shunammite . " when he had called her , she stood before him .
he said , " What then is to be done for her ? " Gehazi answered , " Most certainly she has no son , and her husband is old . "
he said , " Call her . " when he had called her , she stood in the door .
the woman conceived , and bore a son at that season , when the time came around , as Elisha had said to her .
when the child was grown , it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers .
he said to his father , " My head ! my head ! " he said to his servant , " Carry him to his mother . "
when he had taken him , and brought him to his mother , he sat on her knees until noon , and then died .
she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God , and shut the door on him , and went out .
she called to her husband , and said , " Please send me one of the servants , and one of the donkeys , that I may run to the man of God , and come again . "
he said , " Why would you want go to him today ? it is neither new moon nor Sabbath . " she said , " It 's alright . "
then she saddled a donkey , and said to her servant , " Drive , and go forward ! Don 't slow down for me , unless I ask you to . "
so she went , and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel . it happened , when the man of God saw her afar off , that he said to Gehazi his servant , " behold , there is the Shunammite .
please run now to meet her , and ask her , ' Is it well with you ? is it well with your husband ? is it well with the child ? ' " she answered , " It is well . "
then she said , " did I desire a son of my lord ? Didn 't I say , Do not deceive me ? "
the mother of the child said , " As Yahweh lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " he arose , and followed her .
when Elisha had come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid on his bed .
he went in therefore , and shut the door on them both , and prayed to Yahweh .
he went up , and lay on the child , and put his mouth on his mouth , and his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands . he stretched himself on him ; and the flesh of the child grew warm .
then he returned , and walked in the house once back and forth ; and went up , and stretched himself on him . then the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
he called Gehazi , and said , " Call this Shunammite ! " so he called her . when she had come in to him , he said , " Take up your son . "
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
Elisha came again to Gilgal . there was a famine in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him ; and he said to his servant , " Set on the great pot , and boil stew for the sons of the prophets . "
one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full , and came and shred them into the pot of stew ; for they didn 't recognize them .
so they poured out for the men to eat . it happened , as they were eating of the stew , that they cried out , and said , " Man of God , there is death in the pot ! " they could not eat of it .
but he said , " Then bring meal . " he cast it into the pot ; and he said , " pour out for the people , that they may eat . " there was no harm in the pot .
so he set it before them , and they ate , and left some of it , according to the word of Yahweh .
now Naaman , captain of the army of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honorable , because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria : he was also a mighty man of valor , but he was a leper .
the Syrians had gone out in bands , and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden ; and she waited on Naaman 's wife .
she said to her mistress , " I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria ! then he would heal him of his leprosy . "
someone went in , and told his lord , saying , " The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this . "
the king of Syria said , " Go now , and I will send a letter to the king of Israel . " he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of clothing .
he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , " Now when this letter has come to you , behold , I have sent Naaman my servant to you , that you may heal him of his leprosy . "
it was so , when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , " Why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel . "
so Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots , and stood at the door of the house of Elisha .
Elisha sent a messenger to him , saying , " Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and your flesh shall come again to you , and you shall be clean . "
Aren 't Abanah and Pharpar , the rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? Couldn 't I wash in them , and be clean ? " so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
but he said , " As Yahweh lives , before whom I stand , I will receive none . " he urged him to take it ; but he refused .
he said to him , " Go in peace . " so he departed from him a little way .
so Gehazi followed after Naaman . when Naaman saw one running after him , he came down from the chariot to meet him , and said , " Is all well ? "
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they departed .
but he went in , and stood before his master . Elisha said to him , " Where did you come from , Gehazi ? " he said , " Your servant went nowhere . "
therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your seed forever . " he went out from his presence a leper , as white as snow .
the sons of the prophets said to Elisha , " See now , the place where we dwell before you is too small for us .
please let us go to the Jordan , and every man take a beam from there , and let us make us a place there , where we may dwell . " he answered , " Go ! "
one said , " Please be pleased to go with your servants . " he answered , " I will go . "
so he went with them . when they came to the Jordan , they cut down wood .
but as one was felling a beam , the axe head fell into the water . then he cried , and said , " Alas , my master ! for it was borrowed . "
he said , " Take it . " so he put out his hand and took it .
now the king of Syria was warring against Israel ; and he took counsel with his servants , saying , " My camp will be in such and such a place . "
the man of God sent to the king of Israel , saying , " beware that you not pass such a place ; for the Syrians are coming down there . "
the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of ; and he saved himself there , not once nor twice .
the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this . he called his servants , and said to them , " won 't you show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? "
one of his servants said , " No , my lord , O king ; but Elisha , the prophet who is in Israel , tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom . "
he said , " Go and see where he is , that I may send and get him . " it was told him , saying , " behold , he is in Dothan . "
therefore he sent horses , chariots , and a great army there . they came by night , and surrounded the city .
he answered , " Don 't be afraid ; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them . "
when they came down to him , Elisha prayed to Yahweh , and said , " Please strike this people with blindness . " he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha .
Elisha said to them , " This is not the way , neither is this the city . follow me , and I will bring you to the man whom you seek . " he led them to Samaria .
it happened , when they had come into Samaria , that Elisha said , " Yahweh , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . " Yahweh opened their eyes , and they saw ; and behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
the king of Israel said to Elisha , when he saw them , " My father , shall I strike them ? shall I strike them ? "
it happened after this , that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army , and went up and besieged Samaria .
there was a great famine in Samaria . behold , they besieged it , until a donkey 's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a kab of dove 's Dung for five pieces of silver .
as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall , a woman cried to him , saying , " Help , my lord , O king ! "
he said , " If Yahweh doesn 't help you , from where could I help you ? from of the threshing floor , or from the winepress ? "
the king said to her , " What ails you ? " she answered , " This woman said to me , ' Give your son , that we may eat him today , and we will eat my son tomorrow . '
so we boiled my son , and ate him : and I said to her on the next day , ' Give your son , that we may eat him ; ' and she has hidden her son . "
it happened , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he tore his clothes ( now he was passing by on the wall ) ; and the people looked , and behold , he had sackcloth underneath on his flesh .
then he said , " God do so to me , and more also , if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stay on him this day . "
while he was still talking with them , behold , the messenger came down to him . then he said , " behold , this evil is from Yahweh . why should I wait for Yahweh any longer ? "
now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate . they said one to another , " Why do we sit here until we die ?
they rose up in the twilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
therefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their donkeys , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
he called the porters ; and they told it to the king 's household within .
they took therefore two chariots with horses ; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians , saying , " Go and see . "
they went after them to the Jordan ; and behold , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . the messengers returned , and told the king .
the people went out , and plundered the camp of the Syrians . so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of Yahweh .
it happened like that to him ; for the people trod on him in the gate , and he died .
the woman arose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years .
it happened at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines . then she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land .
now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God , saying , " Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done . "
Elisha came to Damascus ; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick . it was told him , saying , " The man of God has come here . "
the king said to Hazael , " Take a present in your hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inquire of Yahweh by him , saying , ' Will I recover from this sickness ? ' "
Elisha said to him , " Go , tell him , ' You shall surely recover ; ' however Yahweh has shown me that he shall surely die . "
he settled his gaze steadfastly on him , until he was ashamed . then the man of God wept .
it happened on the next day , that he took a thick cloth , dipped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died . then Hazael reigned in his place .
in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
he was thirty @-@ two years old when he began to reign . he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife . he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
however Yahweh would not destroy Judah , for David his servant 's sake , as he promised him to give to him a lamp for his children always .
in his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah , and made a king over themselves .
then Joram passed over to Zair , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , and the captains of the chariots ; and the people fled to their tents .
so Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day . then Libnah revolted at the same time .
the rest of the acts of Joram , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Joram slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place .
in the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign .
twenty @-@ two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did the house of Ahab ; for he was the son @-@ in @-@ law of the house of Ahab .
he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead : and the Syrians wounded Joram .
Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets , and said to him , " Put your belt on your waist , take this vial of oil in your hand , and go to Ramoth Gilead .
when you come there , find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brothers , and carry him to an inner room .
then take the vial of oil , and pour it on his head , and say , ' Thus says Yahweh , " I have anointed you king over Israel . " ' then open the door , flee , and don 't wait . "
so the young man , even the young man the prophet , went to Ramoth Gilead .
he arose , and went into the house . then he poured the oil on his head , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh , even over Israel .
you shall strike the house of Ahab your master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh , at the hand of Jezebel .
for the whole house of Ahab shall perish . I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall , both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah .
the dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel , and there shall be none to bury her . ' " he opened the door , and fled .
they said , " That is a lie . tell us now . " he said , " He said to me , ' Thus says Yahweh , I have anointed you king over Israel . ' "
then they hurried , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew the trumpet , saying , " Jehu is king . "
so Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram . ( now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead , he and all Israel , because of Hazael king of Syria ;
so Jehu rode in a chariot , and went to Jezreel ; for Joram lay there . Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram .
the watchman said , " He came to them , and isn 't coming back . the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi ; for he drives furiously . "
Joram turned his hands , and fled , and said to Ahaziah , " There is treason , Ahaziah ! "
Jehu drew his bow with his full strength , and struck Joram between his arms ; and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem , and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David .
in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah .
when Jehu had come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her eyes , and attired her head , and looked out at the window .
as Jehu entered in at the gate , she said , " Do you come in peace , Zimri , you murderer of your master ? "
he lifted up his face to the window , and said , " Who is on my side ? who ? " two or three eunuchs looked out at him .
he said , " throw her down ! " so they threw her down ; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses . then he trampled her under foot .
when he had come in , he ate and drink ; and he said , " See now to this Cursed woman , and bury her ; for she is a king 's daughter . "
they went to bury her ; but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of her hands .
and the body of Jezebel shall be as Dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel , so that they shall not say , " This is Jezebel . " ' "
now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , to the rulers of Jezreel , even the elders , and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab , saying ,
" now as soon as this letter comes to you , since your master 's sons are with you , and there are with you chariots and horses , a fortified city also , and armor .
select the best and fittest of your master 's sons , set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house . "
but they were exceedingly afraid , and said , " behold , the two kings didn 't stand before him ! how then shall we stand ? "
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent them to him to Jezreel .
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righteous . behold , I conspired against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of Yahweh , which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab . for Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah . "
so Jehu struck all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , with all his great men , his familiar friends , and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
he arose and departed , and went to Samaria . as he was at the Shearing house of the shepherds on the way ,
he said , " Come with me , and see my zeal for Yahweh . " so they made him ride in his chariot .
when he came to Samaria , he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke to Elijah .
Jehu gathered all the people together , and said to them , " Ahab served Baal a little ; but Jehu will serve him much .
Jehu said , " Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal ! " they proclaimed it .
Jehu sent through all Israel ; and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that didn 't come . they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another .
he said to him who was over the vestry , " Bring out robes for all the worshippers of Baal ! " he brought robes out to them .
they brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal , and burned them .
they broke down the pillar of Baal , and broke down the house of Baal , and made it a latrine , to this day .
thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel .
however from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin , Jehu didn 't depart from after them , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
but Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh , the God of Israel , with all his heart . he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Jehu , and all that he did , and all his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Jehu slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in Samaria . Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place .
the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty @-@ eight years .
now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal .
he was with her hidden in the house of Yahweh six years . Athaliah reigned over the land .
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the two companies of you , even all who go out on the Sabbath , shall keep the watch of the house of Yahweh around the king .
you shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he who comes within the ranks , let him be slain . be with the king when he goes out , and when he comes in . "
the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded ; and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sabbath , with those who were to go out on the Sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest .
the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David 's , which were in the house of Yahweh .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the house of Yahweh :
Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " Bring her out between the ranks . kill him who follows her with the sword . " for the priest said , " Don 't let her be slain in the house of Yahweh . "
so they made way for her ; and she went by the way of the horses ' entry to the king 's house . she was slain there .
Jehoiada made a Covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people , that they should be Yahweh 's people ; between the king also and the people .
all the people of the land went to the house of Baal , and broke it down ; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . the priest appointed officers over the house of Yahweh .
he took the captains over hundreds , and the Carites , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of Yahweh , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . he sat on the throne of the kings .
so all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was quiet . Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king 's house .
in the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign ; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zibiah of Beersheba .
Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him .
however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
let the priests take it to them , every man from his acquaintance ; and they shall repair the breaches of the house , wherever any breach shall be found . "
but it was so , that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
the priests consented that they should take no more money from the people , neither repair the breaches of the house .
but Jehoiada the priest took a chest , and bored a hole in its lid , and set it beside the altar , on the right side as one comes into the house of Yahweh : and the priests who kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh .
it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king 's scribe and the high priest came up , and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yahweh .
they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work , who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh : and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders , who worked on the house of Yahweh ,
and to the masons and the stone cutters , and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Yahweh , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
but there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups of silver , snuffers , basins , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh ;
for they gave that to those who did the work , and repaired therewith the house of Yahweh .
moreover they didn 't demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work ; for they dealt faithfully .
the money for the trespass offerings , and the money for the sin offerings , was not brought into the house of Yahweh : it was the priests ' .
then Hazael king of Syria went up , and fought against Gath , and took it ; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem .
now the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
his servants arose , and made a conspiracy , and struck Joash at the house of Millo , on the way that goes down to Silla .
for Jozacar the son of Shimeath , and Jehozabad the son of Shomer , his servants , struck him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Amaziah his son reigned in his place .
in the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah , king of Judah , Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael , continually .
Jehoahaz begged Yahweh , and Yahweh listened to him ; for he saw the oppression of Israel , how that the king of Syria oppressed them .
( Yahweh gave Israel a Savior , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians ; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before .
nevertheless they didn 't depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked therein : and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria . )
for he didn 't leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the dust in threshing .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Jehoahaz slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in Samaria : and Joash his son reigned in his place .
in the thirty @-@ seventh year of Joash king of Judah , Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria for sixteen years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ; he didn 't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; but he walked therein .
now the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Joash slept with his fathers ; and Jeroboam sat on his throne : and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel .
now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died : and Joash the king of Israel came down to him , and wept over him , and said , " My father , my father , the chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! "
Elisha said to him , " Take bow and arrows " ; and he took to him bow and arrows .
he said to the king of Israel , " Put your hand on the bow " ; and he put his hand on it . Elisha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
he said , " Take the arrows " ; and he took them . he said to the king of Israel , " Strike the ground " ; and he struck three times , and stopped .
Elisha died , and they buried him . now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
it happened , as they were burying a man , that behold , they spied a band ; and they cast the man into the tomb of Elisha : and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha , he revived , and stood up on his feet .
Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz .
Hazael king of Syria died ; and Benhadad his son reigned in his place .
in the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , yet not like David his father : he did according to all that Joash his father had done .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father :
he killed of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand , and took Sela by war , and called its name Joktheel , to this day .
then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
but Amaziah would not listen . so Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
Judah was defeated by Israel ; and they fled every man to his tent .
Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth Shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Jehoash slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel ; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his place .
Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years .
now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish : but they sent after him to Lachish , and killed him there .
they brought him on horses ; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David .
all the people of Judah took Azariah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
he built Elath , and restored it to Judah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
in the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah , Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria for forty @-@ one years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
for Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter ; for there was none shut up nor left at large , neither was there any helper for Israel .
Yahweh didn 't say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky ; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash .
now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , and all that he did , and his might , how he warred , and how he recovered Damascus , and Hamath , which had belonged to Judah , for Israel , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the twenty @-@ seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that his father Amaziah had done .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
Yahweh struck the king , so that he was a leper to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house . Jotham the king 's son was over the household , judging the people of the land .
now the rest of the acts of Azariah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?

Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him , and struck him before the people , and killed him , and reigned in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Zechariah , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
this was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu , saying , " Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty @-@ ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah ; and he reigned for a month in Samaria .
Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah , and came to Samaria , and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria , and killed him , and reigned in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Shallum , and his conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
in the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah , Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel for ten years in Samaria .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
there came against the land Pul the king of Assyria ; and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand .
now the rest of the acts of Menahem , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Menahem slept with his fathers ; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his place .
in the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria for two years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
in the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria for twenty years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and struck him , and killed him , and reigned in his place , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
now the rest of the acts of Pekah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
in the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh ; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places . he built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
in those days Yahweh began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah .
Jotham slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Ahaz his son reigned in his place .
in the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign .
twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel .
he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war : and they besieged Ahaz , but could not overcome him .
at that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria , and drove the Jews from Elath ; and the Syrians came to Elath , and lived there , to this day .
so Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria , saying , " I am your servant and your son . come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , who rise up against me . "
Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
the king of Assyria listened to him ; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried its people captive to Kir , and killed Rezin .
Urijah the priest built an altar : according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus , so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus .
when the king had come from Damascus , the king saw the altar : and the king drew near to the altar , and offered on it .
he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , on the altar .
the bronze altar , which was before Yahweh , he brought from the forefront of the house , from between his altar and the house of Yahweh , and put it on the north side of his altar .
Urijah the priest did so , according to all that king Ahaz commanded .
King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases , and removed the basin from off them , and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it , and put it on a pavement of stone .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Ahaz slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place .
in the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah , Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel for nine years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him .
against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria ; and Hoshea became his servant , and brought him tribute .
then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land , and went up to Samaria , and besieged it three years .
in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away to Assyria , and placed them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and walked in the statutes of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they made .
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city ;
and they set them up pillars and Asherim on every high hill , and under every green tree ;
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them ; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger ;
and they served idols , of which Yahweh had said to them , " You shall not do this thing . "
notwithstanding , they would not listen , but hardened their neck , like the neck of their fathers , who didn 't believe in Yahweh their God .
they forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made an Asherah , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served Baal .
they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
also Judah didn 't keep the commandments of Yahweh their God , but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made .
Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he tore Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh , and made them sin a great sin .
the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did ; they didn 't depart from them ;
until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight , as he spoke by all his servants the prophets . so Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day .
the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon , and from Cuthah , and from Avva , and from Hamath and Sepharvaim , and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel ; and they possessed Samaria , and lived in the cities of it .
so it was , at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they didn 't fear Yahweh : therefore Yahweh sent lions among them , which killed some of them .
then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , " Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the law of the god of the land . "
so one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel , and taught them how they should fear Yahweh .
however every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities in which they lived .
the men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth , and the men of Cuth made Nergal , and the men of Hamath made Ashima ,
and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak ; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
so they feared Yahweh , and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
they feared Yahweh , and served their own gods , after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away .
with whom Yahweh had made a Covenant , and commanded them , saying , " You shall not fear other gods , nor bow yourselves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them ;
but you shall fear Yahweh , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm , and you shall bow yourselves to him , and you shall sacrifice to him .
the statutes and the ordinances , and the law and the commandment , which he wrote for you , you shall observe to do forevermore . you shall not fear other gods .
you shall not forget the Covenant that I have made with you ; neither shall you fear other gods .
but you shall fear Yahweh your God ; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies . "
however they did not listen , but they did what they did before .
so these nations feared Yahweh , and served their engraved images . their children likewise , and their children 's children , as their fathers did , so they do to this day .
now it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that David his father had done .
he removed the high places , and broke the pillars , and cut down the Asherah : and he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made ; for in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it ; and he called it Nehushtan .
he trusted in Yahweh , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor among them that were before him .
for he joined with Yahweh ; he didn 't depart from following him , but kept his commandments , which Yahweh commanded Moses .
Yahweh was with him ; wherever he went forth he prospered : and he rebelled against the king of Assyria , and didn 't serve him .
he struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city .
it happened in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
at the end of three years they took it : in the sixth year of Hezekiah , which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria , and put them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ,
because they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh their God , but transgressed his Covenant , even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded , and would not hear it , nor do it .
now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah , and took them .
Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
at that time , Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh 's temple , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem . they went up and came to Jerusalem . when they had come up , they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool , which is in the highway of the fuller 's field .
when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebnah the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
Rabshakeh said to them , " Say now to Hezekiah , ' Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria , " What confidence is this in which you trust ?
you say ( but they are but vain words ) , ' There is counsel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
now , behold , you trust in the staff of this bruised Reed , even in Egypt . if a man leans on it , it will go into his hand , and Pierce it . so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him .
now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
have I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it ? Yahweh said to me , ' Go up against this land , and destroy it . ' " ' "
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria .
thus says the king , ' Don 't let Hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
but the people held their peace , and answered him not a word ; for the king 's commandment was , " Don 't answer him . "
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , came with Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of Yahweh .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
they said to him , " Thus says Hezekiah , ' This day is a day of trouble , of rebuke , and of rejection ; for the children have come to the point of birth , and there is no strength to deliver them .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will put a spirit in him , and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "
so Rabshakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah ; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish .
when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , " behold , he has come out to fight against you , he sent messengers again to Hezekiah , saying ,
'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , " Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
behold , you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands , by destroying them utterly . will you be delivered ?
have the gods of the nations delivered them , which my fathers have destroyed , Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden that were in Telassar ?
where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? " ' "
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it . then Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh , and spread it before Yahweh .
Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh , and said , " Yahweh , the God of Israel , who sit above the cherubim , you are the God , even you alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth . you have made heaven and earth .
Incline your ear , Yahweh , and hear . open your eyes , Yahweh , and see . hear the words of Sennacherib , with which he has sent to defy the living God .
truly , Yahweh , the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands ,
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , Yahweh our God , save us , I beg you , out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you , Yahweh , are God alone . "
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dug and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt . '
haven 't you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dismayed and confounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green herb , like the grass on the housetops , and like grain blasted before it has grown up .
but I know your sitting down , and your going out , and your coming in , and your raging against me .
because of your raging against me , and because your arrogance has come up into my ears , therefore will I put my hook in your nose , and my bridle in your lips , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came . "
" ' this shall be the sign to you : you shall eat this year that which grows of itself , and in the second year that which springs of the same ; and in the third year sow , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat its fruit .
the remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
for out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out , and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape . the zeal of Yahweh will perform this . '
" therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria , ' He shall not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mound against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yahweh .
'For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
it happened that night , that the angel of Yahweh went out , and struck one hundred eighty @-@ five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
so Sennacherib king of Assyria departed , and went and returned , and lived at Nineveh .
it happened , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place .
in those days was Hezekiah sick to death . Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Set your house in order ; for you shall die , and not live . ' "
then he turned his face to the wall , and prayed to Yahweh , saying ,
" remember now , Yahweh , I beg you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " Hezekiah wept bitterly .
it happened , before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city , that the word of Yahweh came to him , saying ,
I will add to your days fifteen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . " ' "
Isaiah said , " Take a cake of figs . " they took and laid it on the boil , and he recovered .
Hezekiah said to Isaiah , " What shall be the sign that Yahweh will heal me , and that I shall go up to the house of Yahweh the third day ? "
Isaiah said , " This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh , that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or go back ten steps ? "
Hezekiah answered , " It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps . Nay , but let the shadow return backward ten steps . "
Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh ; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward , by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz .
at that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah ; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah , and said to him , " What did these men say ? from where did they come to you ? " Hezekiah said , " They have come from a far country , even from Babylon . "
he said , " What have they seen in your house ? " Hezekiah answered , " They have seen all that is in my house . there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them . "
Isaiah said to Hezekiah , " Hear the word of Yahweh .
'Behold , the days come , that all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day , shall be carried to Babylon . nothing shall be left , ' says Yahweh .
'Of your sons who shall issue from you , whom you shall father , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon . ' "
then Hezekiah said to Isaiah , " The word of Yahweh which you have spoken is good . " he said moreover , " Isn 't it so , if peace and truth shall be in my days ? "
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and all his might , and how he made the pool , and the conduit , and brought water into the city , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Hezekiah slept with his fathers ; and Manasseh his son reigned in his place .
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hephzibah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars for Baal , and made an Asherah , as did Ahab king of Israel , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served them .
he built altars in the house of Yahweh , of which Yahweh said , " I will put my name in Jerusalem . "
he built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh .
he made his son to pass through the fire , and practiced sorcery , and used enchantments , and dealt with those who had familiar spirits , and with wizards : he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
but they didn 't listen : and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than the nations did whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel .
Yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets , saying ,
I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies . they will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which is evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza : and Amon his son reigned in his place .
Amon was twenty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as Manasseh his father did .
he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the idols that his father served , and worshiped them :
and he forsook Yahweh , the God of his fathers , and didn 't walk in the way of Yahweh .
the servants of Amon conspired against him , and put the king to death in his own house .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza : and Josiah his son reigned in his place .
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty @-@ one years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in all the way of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan , the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of Yahweh , saying ,
" go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh , which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
however there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand ; for they dealt faithfully . "
Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , " Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh . "
Shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , " Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me . " Shaphan read it before the king .
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he tore his clothes .
the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Micaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
so Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asaiah , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter ) ; and they talked with her .
she said to them , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : ' tell the man who sent you to me ,
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read .
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands , therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place , and it shall not be quenched . ' "
but to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Yahweh , thus you shall tell him , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : ' concerning the words which you have heard ,
'Therefore behold , I will gather you to your fathers , and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace , neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place . ' " ' " they brought back this message to the king .
the king sent , and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem .
he brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh , outside of Jerusalem , to the Brook Kidron , and burned it at the Brook Kidron , and beat it to dust , and cast its dust on the graves of the common people .
he broke down the houses of the sodomites , that were in the house of Yahweh , where the women wove hangings for the Asherah .
nevertheless the priests of the high places didn 't come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem , but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers .
he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
he broke in pieces the pillars , and cut down the Asherim , and filled their places with the bones of men .
moreover the altar that was at Bethel , and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , had made , even that altar and the high place he broke down ; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust , and burned the Asherah .
he said , " Let him be ! let no man move his bones . " so they let his bones alone , with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria .
all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria , which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh to anger , Josiah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel .
he killed all the priests of the high places that were there , on the altars , and burned men 's bones on them ; and he returned to Jerusalem .
the king commanded all the people , saying , " keep the Passover to Yahweh your God , as it is written in this book of the Covenant . "
surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this Passover kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem .
like him was there no king before him , who turned to Yahweh with all his heart , and with all his soul , and with all his might , according to all the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him .
notwithstanding , Yahweh didn 't turn from the fierceness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo , and brought him to Jerusalem , and buried him in his own tomb . the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and anointed him , and made him king in his father 's place .
Jehoahaz was twenty @-@ three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his fathers had done .
Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father , and changed his name to Jehoiakim : but he took Jehoahaz away ; and he came to Egypt , and died there .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his fathers had done .
in his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up , and Jehoiakim became his servant three years : then he turned and rebelled against him .
Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by his servants the prophets .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
so Jehoiakim slept with his fathers ; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place .
the king of Egypt didn 't come again out of his land any more ; for the king of Babylon had taken , from the Brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates , all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
Jehoiachin was Eighteen years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months : and his mother 's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his father had done .
at that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem , and the city was besieged .
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city , while his servants were besieging it ;
and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
he carried out there all the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold , which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yahweh 's temple , as Yahweh had said .
the king of Babylon made Mattaniah , Jehoiachin 's father 's brother , king is his place , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of Yahweh , it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and encamped against it ; and they built forts against it around it .
so the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah .
on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah ; and they gave judgment on him .
they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
now in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , a servant of the king of Babylon , to Jerusalem .
he burnt the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burnt he with fire .
all the army of the Chaldeans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down the walls around Jerusalem .
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Babylon , and the residue of the multitude .
but the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields .
the Chaldeans broke up the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh , and carried the brass pieces to Babylon .
they took away the pots , the shovels , the snuffers , the spoons , and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered .
the captain of the guard took away the fire pans , the basins , that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
the two pillars , the one sea , and the bases , which Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh , the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the threshold :
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
as for the people who were left in the land of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , governor .
now when all the captains of the forces , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor , they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite , they and their men .
Gedaliah swore to them and to their men , and said to them , " Don 't be afraid because of the servants of the Chaldeans . dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you . "
but it happened in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the royal seed came , and ten men with him , and struck Gedaliah , so that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah .
all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the forces , arose , and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans .
it happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , that Evilmerodach king of Babylon , in the year that he began to reign , lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison ;
and he spoke kindly to him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon ,
and changed his prison garments . Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life :
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him of the king , every day a portion , all the days of his life .

the battle went hard against Saul , and the archers overtook him ; and he was distressed by reason of the archers .
when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead , he likewise fell on his sword , and died .
so Saul died , and his three sons ; and all his house died together .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook their cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they stripped him , and took his head , and his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to their idols , and to the people .
when all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul ,
all the valiant men arose , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron , saying , " behold , we are your bone and your flesh .
in times past , even when Saul was king , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yahweh your God said to you , ' You shall be shepherd of my people Israel , and you shall be prince over my people Israel . ' "
so all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron ; and David made a Covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh ; and they anointed David king over Israel , according to the word of Yahweh by Samuel .
David and all Israel went to Jerusalem ( the same is Jebus ) ; and the Jebusites , the inhabitants of the land , were there .

David said , " Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain . " Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first , and was made chief .
David lived in the stronghold ; therefore they called it the city of David .
he built the city all around , from Millo even around ; and Joab repaired the rest of the city .
David grew greater and greater ; for Yahweh of Armies was with him .
now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom , together with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel .
this is the number of the mighty men whom David had : Jashobeam , the son of a Hachmonite , the chief of the thirty ; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time .
after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo , the Ahohite , who was one of the three mighty men .
he was with David at Pasdammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines .
they stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Philistines ; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
David longed , and said , " Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! "
the three broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to Yahweh ,
Abishai , the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more honorable than the two , and was made their captain : however he didn 't attain to the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things , and had a name among the three mighty men .
behold , he was more honorable than the thirty , but he didn 't attain to the three : and David set him over his guard .
also the mighty men of the armies : Asahel the brother of Joab , Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem ,
IRA the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite , Abiezer the Anathothite ,
Sibbecai the Hushathite , Ilai the Ahohite ,

Eliel the Mahavite , and Jeribai , and Joshaviah , the sons of Elnaam , and Ithmah the Moabite ,
Eliel , and Obed , and Jaasiel the Mezobaite .
now these are those who came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish ; and they were among the mighty men , his helpers in war .
they were armed with bows , and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow : they were of Saul 's brothers of Benjamin .
the chief was Ahiezer ; then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite , and Jeziel , and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth , and Beracah , and Jehu the Anathothite ,
and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty , and Jeremiah , and Jahaziel , and Johanan , and Jozabad the Gederathite ,
Elkanah , and Isshiah , and Azarel , and Joezer , and Jashobeam , the Korahites ,
and Joelah , and Zebadiah , the sons of Jeroham of Gedor .
Ezer the chief , Obadiah the second , Eliab the third ,
Mishmannah the fourth , Jeremiah the fifth ,
Attai the sixth , Eliel the seventh ,
Jeremiah the tenth , Machbannai the eleventh .
these of the sons of Gad were captains of the army : he who was least was equal to one hundred , and the greatest to one thousand .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had overflowed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David .
as he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Jozabad , and Jediael , and Michael , and Jozabad , and Elihu , and Zillethai , captains of thousands who were of Manasseh .
they helped David against the band of rovers : for they were all mighty men of valor , and were captains in the army .
for from day to day men came to David to help him , until there was a great army , like the army of God .
these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war , who came to David to Hebron , to turn the kingdom of Saul to him , according to the word of Yahweh .
the children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred , armed for war .
of the children of Simeon , mighty men of valor for the war , seven thousand and one hundred .
of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred .
Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron ; and with him were three thousand and seven hundred ,
and Zadok , a young man mighty of valor , and of his father 's house twenty @-@ two captains .
of the children of Benjamin , the brothers of Saul , three thousand : for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul .
of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred , mighty men of valor , famous men in their fathers ' houses .
of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh Eighteen thousand , who were mentioned by name , to come and make David king .
of the children of Issachar , men who had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , their heads were two hundred ; and all their brothers were at their commandment .
of Naphtali one thousand captains , and with them with shield and spear thirty @-@ seven thousand .
of the Danites who could set the battle in array , twenty @-@ eight thousand six hundred .
of Asher , such as were able to go out in the army , who could set the battle in array , forty thousand .
on the other side of the Jordan , of the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle , one hundred twenty thousand .
they were there with David three days , eating and drinking ; for their brothers had made preparation for them .
David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds , even with every leader .
and let us bring again the Ark of our God to us . for we didn 't seek it in the days of Saul . "
all the assembly said that they would do so ; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
so David assembled all Israel together , from the Shihor the Brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath , to bring the Ark of God from Kiriath Jearim .
they carried the Ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart .
David and all Israel played before God with all their might , even with songs , and with harps , and with stringed instruments , and with tambourines , and with cymbals , and with trumpets .
when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon , Uzza put forth his hand to hold the Ark ; for the oxen stumbled .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza , and he struck him , because he put forth his hand to the Ark ; and there he died before God .
David was displeased , because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzza ; and he called that place Perez Uzza , to this day .
David was afraid of God that day , saying , " How shall I bring the Ark of God home to me ? "
so David didn 't move the Ark to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
the Ark of God remained with the family of Obed @-@ Edom in his house three months : and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed @-@ Edom , and all that he had .
Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David , and cedar trees , and masons , and carpenters , to build him a house .
David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel ; for his kingdom was exalted on high , for his people Israel 's sake .
David took more wives at Jerusalem ; and David became the father of more sons and daughters .
these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon ,
and Elishama , and Beeliada , and Eliphelet .
when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David : and David heard of it , and went out against them .
now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim .
David inquired of God , saying , " shall I go up against the Philistines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? " Yahweh said to him , " Go up ; for I will deliver them into your hand . "
they left their gods there ; and David gave commandment , and they were burned with fire .
the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley .
David inquired again of God ; and God said to him , " You shall not go up after them . turn away from them , and come on them over against the mulberry trees .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
David did as God commanded him : and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer .
the fame of David went out into all lands ; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations .
David made him houses in the city of David ; and he prepared a place for the Ark of God , and pitched for it a tent .
then David said , " No one ought to carry the Ark of God but the Levites . for Yahweh has chosen them to carry the Ark of God , and to minister to him forever . "
David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of Yahweh to its place , which he had prepared for it .
David gathered together the sons of Aaron , and the Levites :
of the sons of Kohath , Uriel the chief , and his brothers one hundred twenty ;
of the sons of Merari , Asaiah the chief , and his brothers two hundred twenty ;
of the sons of Gershom , Joel the chief , and his brothers one hundred thirty ;
of the sons of Elizaphan , Shemaiah the chief , and his brothers two hundred ;
of the sons of Hebron , Eliel the chief , and his brothers eighty ;
of the sons of Uzziel , Amminadab the chief , and his brothers one hundred twelve .
David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests , and for the Levites , for Uriel , Asaiah , and Joel , Shemaiah , and Eliel , and Amminadab ,
and said to them , " You are the heads of the fathers ' households of the Levites . Sanctify yourselves , both you and your brothers , that you may bring up the Ark of Yahweh , the God of Israel , to the place that I have prepared for it .
for because you didn 't carry it at first , Yahweh our God made broke out against us , because we didn 't seek him according to the ordinance . "
so the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
the children of the Levites bore the Ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh .
David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers , with instruments of music , stringed instruments and harps and cymbals , sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy .
so the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brothers , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brothers , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
so the singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud ;
and Zechariah , and Aziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , and Eliab , and Maaseiah , and Benaiah , with stringed instruments set to Alamoth ;
and Mattithiah , and Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps tuned to the eight @-@ stringed Lyre , to lead .
Chenaniah , chief of the Levites , was over the song : he instructed about the song , because he was skillful .
Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the Ark .
Shebaniah , and Joshaphat , and Nethanel , and Amasai , and Zechariah , and Benaiah , and Eliezer , the priests , blew the trumpets before the Ark of God : and Obed @-@ Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the Ark .
so David , and the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed @-@ Edom with joy .
it happened , when God helped the Levites who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams .
David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites who bore the Ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : and David had on him an ephod of linen .
thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh with shouting , and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpets , and with cymbals , sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps .
it happened , as the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she despised him in her heart .
they brought in the Ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God .
when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh .
he dealt to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a portion of meat , and a cake of raisins .
he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the Ark of Yahweh , and to celebrate and to thank and praise Yahweh , the God of Israel :
Asaph the chief , and second to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , with stringed instruments and with harps ; and Asaph with cymbals , sounding aloud ;
and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually , before the Ark of the Covenant of God .
then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh , by the hand of Asaph and his brothers .
Oh give thanks to Yahweh . call on his name . make his doings known among the peoples .
sing to him . sing praises to him . tell of all his marvelous works .
glory in his holy name . let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice .
seek Yahweh and his strength . seek his face forever more .
remember his marvelous works that he has done , his wonders , and the judgments of his mouth ,
he is Yahweh our God . his judgments are in all the earth .
remember his Covenant forever , the word which he commanded to a thousand generations ,
he confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute , and to Israel for an everlasting Covenant ,
when you were but a few men in number , yes , very few , and foreigners were in it .
they went about from nation to nation , from one kingdom to another people .
he allowed no man to do them wrong . yes , he reproved kings for their sakes ,
" Don 't touch my anointed ones ! do my prophets no harm ! "
sing to Yahweh , all the earth ! display his salvation from day to day .
declare his glory among the nations , and his marvelous works among all the peoples .
for great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised . he also is to be feared above all gods .
for all the gods of the peoples are idols , but Yahweh made the heavens .
honor and majesty are before him . strength and gladness are in his place .
Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name . bring an offering , and come before him . worship Yahweh in holy array .
Tremble before him , all the earth . the world also is established that it can 't be moved .
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice ! let them say among the nations , " Yahweh reigns ! "
let the sea roar , and its fullness ! let the field exult , and all that is therein !
then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh , for he comes to judge the earth .
say , " Save us , God of our salvation ! gather us together and deliver us from the nations , to give thanks to your holy name , to triumph in your praise . "
blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , from everlasting even to everlasting . all the people said , " Amen , " and praised Yahweh .
so he left there , before the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , Asaph and his brothers , to minister before the Ark continually , as every day 's work required ;
and Obed @-@ Edom with their brothers , sixty @-@ eight ; Obed @-@ Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers ;
and Zadok the priest , and his brothers the priests , before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon ,
to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh , which he commanded to Israel ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Yahweh , because his loving kindness endures forever ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate .
all the people departed every man to his house : and David returned to bless his house .
it happened , when David lived in his house , that David said to Nathan the prophet , " behold , I dwell in a house of cedar , but the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh is under curtains . "
Nathan said to David , " Do all that is in your heart ; for God is with you . "
it happened the same night , that the word of God came to Nathan , saying ,
" go and tell David my servant , ' Thus says Yahweh , " You shall not build me a house to dwell in ;
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
" now therefore , you shall tell my servant David , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " I took you from the sheep pen , from following the sheep , that you should be prince over my people Israel .
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
he shall build me a house , and I will establish his throne forever .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . I will not take my loving kindness away from him , as I took it from him that was before you ;
but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever . his throne shall be established forever . " ' "
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so Nathan spoke to David .
then David the king went in , and sat before Yahweh ; and he said , " Who am I , Yahweh God , and what is my house , that you have brought me thus far ?
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Yahweh God .
what can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant ? for you know your servant .
Yahweh , for your servant 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make known all these great things .
Yahweh , there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
for your people Israel you made your own people forever ; and you , Yahweh , became their God .
now , Yahweh , let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant , and concerning his house , be established forever , and do as you have spoken .
for you , my God , have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house . therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you .
now , Yahweh , you are God , and have promised this good thing to your servant .
now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant , that it may continue forever before you ; for you , Yahweh , have blessed , and it is blessed forever . "
after this it happened , that David struck the Philistines , and subdued them , and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines .
he struck Moab ; and the Moabites became servants to David , and brought tribute .
David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath , as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates .
David took from him one thousand chariots , and seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen ; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses , but reserved of them for one hundred chariots .
when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David struck of the Syrians twenty @-@ two thousand men .
then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus ; and the Syrians became servants to David , and brought tribute . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went .
David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
from Tibhath and from Cun , cities of Hadadezer , David took very much brass , with which Solomon made the bronze sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah ,
King David also dedicated these to Yahweh , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt Eighteen thousand .
he put garrisons in Edom ; and all the Edomites became servants to David . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went .
David reigned over all Israel ; and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people .
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder ;
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and the sons of David were chief about the king .
it happened after this , that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died , and his son reigned in his place .
so Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved them , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
then there went certain persons , and told David how the men were served . he sent to meet them ; for the men were greatly ashamed . the king said , " Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown , and then return . "
when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David , Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia , and out of Arammaacah , and out of Zobah .
so they hired for themselves thirty @-@ two thousand chariots , and the king of Maacah and his people , who came and encamped before Medeba . the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
when David heard of it , he sent Joab , and all the army of the mighty men .
the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the gate of the city : and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother ; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you are to help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will help you .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God . May Yahweh do that which seems good to him . "
so Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle ; and they fled before him .
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
when the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River , with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came on them , and set the battle in array against them . so when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians , they fought with him .
the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots , and forty thousand footmen , and killed Shophach the captain of the army .
David took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it ; and it was set on David 's head : and he brought forth the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
it happened after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai , of the sons of the giant ; and they were subdued .
there was again war with the Philistines ; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
there was again war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were twenty @-@ four , six on each hand , and six on each foot ; and he also was born to the giant .
when he defied Israel , Jonathan the son of Shimea David 's brother killed him .
these were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
Satan stood up against Israel , and moved David to number Israel .
David said to Joab and to the princes of the people , " Go , number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan ; and bring me word , that I may know the sum of them . "
nevertheless the king 's word prevailed against Joab . therefore Joab departed , and went throughout all Israel , and came to Jerusalem .
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword : and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword .
but he didn 't count Levi and Benjamin among them ; for the king 's word was abominable to Joab .
God was displeased with this thing ; therefore he struck Israel .
David said to God , " I have sinned greatly , in that I have done this thing . but now , put away , I beg you , the iniquity of your servant ; for I have done very foolishly . "
Yahweh spoke to Gad , David 's seer , saying ,
" go and speak to David , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh , " I offer you three things . choose one of them , that I may do it to you . " ' "
so Gad came to David , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Take your choice :
David said to Gad , " I am in distress . let me fall , I pray , into the hand of Yahweh ; for his mercies are very great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
so Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel ; and seventy thousand men of Israel fell .
then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up , and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
David went up at the saying of Gad , which he spoke in the name of Yahweh .
Ornan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves . now Ornan was threshing wheat .
as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
so David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place .
David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called on Yahweh ; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering .
Yahweh commanded the angel ; and he put up his sword again into its sheath .
at that time , when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite , then he sacrificed there .
for the tabernacle of Yahweh , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering , were at that time in the high place at Gibeon .
but David couldn 't go before it to inquire of God ; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh .
then David said , " This is the house of Yahweh God , and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel . "
David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build God 's house .
David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the couplings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
and cedar trees without number : for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David .
then he called for Solomon his son , and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh , the God of Israel .
David said to Solomon his son , " As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God .
but the word of Yahweh came to me , saying , ' You have shed blood abundantly , and have made great wars . you shall not build a house to my name , because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight .
he shall build a house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever . '
now , my son , may Yahweh be with you and prosper you , and build the house of Yahweh your God , as he has spoken concerning you .
May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding , and put you in charge of Israel ; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God .
then you will prosper , if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel . be strong , and courageous . Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed .
now , behold , in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Yahweh one hundred thousand talents of gold , one million talents of silver , and brass and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance . I have also prepared timber and stone ; and you may add to them .
there are also workmen with you in abundance , cutters and workers of stone and timber , and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work :
of the gold , the silver , and the brass , and the iron , there is no number . arise and be doing , and may Yahweh be with you . "
David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son , saying ,
now David was old and full of days ; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
he gathered together all the princes of Israel , with the priests and the Levites .
the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty @-@ eight thousand .
David said , " Of these , twenty @-@ four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh ; six thousand were officers and judges ;
four thousand were doorkeepers ; and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made , for giving praise . "
David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi : Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
of the Gershonites : Ladan and Shimei .
the sons of Ladan : Jehiel the chief , and Zetham , and Joel , three .
the sons of Shimei : Jahath , Zina , and Jeush , and Beriah . these four were the sons of Shimei .
Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah didn 't have many sons ; therefore they became a fathers ' house in one reckoning .
the sons of Kohath : Amram , Izhar , Hebron , and Uzziel , four .
the sons of Amram : Aaron and Moses ; and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons , forever , to burn incense before Yahweh , to minister to him , and to bless in his name , forever .
but as for Moses the man of God , his sons were named among the tribe of Levi .
the sons of Moses : Gershom and Eliezer .
the sons of Gershom : Shebuel the chief .
the sons of Eliezer were : Rehabiah the chief ; and Eliezer had no other sons ; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many .
the sons of Izhar : Shelomith the chief .
the sons of Uzziel : Micah the chief , and Isshiah the second .
the sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . the sons of Mahli : Eleazar and Kish .
Eleazar died , and had no sons , but daughters only : and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives .
the sons of Mushi : Mahli , and Eder , and Jeremoth , three .
these were the sons of Levi after their fathers ' houses , even the heads of the fathers ' houses of those who were counted individually , in the number of names by their polls , who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh , from twenty years old and upward .
for David said , " Yahweh , the God of Israel , has given rest to his people ; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever .
also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service . "
for by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered , from twenty years old and upward .
for their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh , in the courts , and in the rooms , and in the purifying of all holy things , even the work of the service of God 's house ;
and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh , and likewise in the evening ;
and that they should keep the duty of the tent of Meeting , and the duty of the holy place , and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers , for the service of the house of Yahweh .
these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron . the sons of Aaron : Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
but Nadab and Abihu died before their father , and had no children : therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest 's office .
David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , divided them according to their ordering in their service .
there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar ; and they were divided like this : of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen , heads of fathers ' houses ; and of the sons of Ithamar , according to their fathers ' houses , eight .
thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots ; for there were princes of the sanctuary , and princes of God , both of the sons of Eleazar , and of the sons of Ithamar .
now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib , the second to Jedaiah ,
the fifth to Malchijah , the sixth to Mijamin ,
the ninth to Jeshua , the tenth to Shecaniah ,
the eleventh to Eliashib , the twelfth to Jakim ,

moreover , David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph , and of Heman , and of Jeduthun , who should prophesy with harps , with stringed instruments , and with cymbals : and the number of those who did the work according to their service was :

all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Yahweh , with cymbals , stringed instruments , and harps , for the service of God 's house ; Asaph , Jeduthun , and Heman being under the order of the king .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh , even all who were skillful , was two hundred eighty @-@ eight .

the sons of Shemaiah : Othni , and Rephael , and Obed , Elzabad , whose brothers were valiant men , Elihu , and Semachiah .
all these were of the sons of Obed @-@ Edom : they and their sons and their brothers , able men in strength for the service ; sixty @-@ two of Obed @-@ Edom .

Hilkiah the second , Tebaliah the third , Zechariah the fourth : all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen .
of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers , even of the chief men , having offices like their brothers , to minister in the house of Yahweh .
they cast lots , the small as well as the great , according to their fathers ' houses , for every gate .
the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah . then for Zechariah his son , a wise counselor , they cast lots ; and his lot came out northward .

this Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the heads of the fathers ' households , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the army , had dedicated .
they dedicated some of the spoil won in battles to repair the house of Yahweh .
all that Samuel the seer , and Saul the son of Kish , and Abner the son of Ner , and Joab the son of Zeruiah , had dedicated , whoever had dedicated anything , it was under the hand of Shelomoth , and of his brothers .
of the Izharites , Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel , for officers and judges .

but David didn 't take the number of them from twenty years old and under , because Yahweh had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky .
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but didn 't finish ; and there came wrath for this on Israel ; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David .
over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the towers , was Jonathan the son of Uzziah :

Ahithophel was the king 's counselor : and Hushai the Archite was the king 's friend :
and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah , and Abiathar : and the captain of the king 's army was Joab .
but God said to me , ' You shall not build a house for my name , because you are a man of war , and have shed blood . '
of all my sons ( for Yahweh has given me many sons ) , he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh 's kingdom over Israel .
he said to me , ' Solomon , your son , shall build my house and my courts ; for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
I will establish his kingdom forever , if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances , as at this day . '
take heed now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary . be strong , and do it . "
then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple , and of its houses , and of its treasuries , and of the upper rooms of it , and of the inner rooms of it , and of the place of the mercy seat ;
and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit , for the courts of the house of Yahweh , and for all the surrounding rooms , for the treasuries of God 's house , and for the treasuries of the dedicated things ;
also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites , and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh , and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh ;
of gold by weight for the gold , for all vessels of every kind of service ; for all the vessels of silver by weight , for all vessels of every kind of service ;
by weight also for the lampstands of gold , and for its lamps , of gold , by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps ; and for the lampstands of silver , by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps , according to the use of every lampstand ;
and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread , for every table ; and silver for the tables of silver ;
and the forks , and the basins , and the cups , of pure gold ; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl ; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl ;
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot , the cherubim , that spread out , and covered the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh .
" all this , " said David , " I have been made to understand in writing from the hand of Yahweh , even all the works of this pattern . "
David the king said to all the assembly , " Solomon my son , whom alone God has chosen , is yet young and tender , and the work is great ; for the palace is not for man , but for Yahweh God .
in addition , because I have set my affection on the house of my God , since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver , I give it to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house ,
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , with which to overlay the walls of the houses ;
of gold for the things of gold , and of silver for the things of silver , and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans . who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh ? "
then the princes of the fathers ' households , and the princes of the tribes of Israel , and the captains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rulers over the king 's work , offered willingly ;
and they gave for the service of God 's house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass Eighteen thousand talents , and of iron a hundred thousand talents .
they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh , under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite .
then the people rejoiced , because they offered willingly , because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly ; and David said , " You are blessed , Yahweh , the God of Israel our father , forever and ever .
yours , Yahweh , is the greatness , the power , the glory , the victory , and the majesty ! for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours . yours is the kingdom , Yahweh , and you are exalted as head above all .
both riches and honor come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly as this ? for all things come from you , and of your own have we given you .
for we are strangers before you , and foreigners , as all our fathers were . our days on the earth are as a shadow , and there is no remaining .
Yahweh our God , all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand , and is all your own .
Yahweh , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Israel , our fathers , keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people , and prepare their heart for you ;
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your commandments , your testimonies , and your statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "
David said to all the assembly , " Now bless Yahweh your God ! " all the assembly blessed Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king .
they sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh , and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh , on the next day after that day , even one thousand bulls , one thousand rams , and one thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel ,
then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father , and prospered ; and all Israel obeyed him .
all the princes , the mighty men , and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king .
Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel .
the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years ; he reigned seven years in Hebron , and he reigned thirty @-@ three years in Jerusalem .
he died in a good old age , full of days , riches , and honor : and Solomon his son reigned in his place .
now the acts of David the king , first and last , behold , they are written in the history of Samuel the seer , and in the history of Nathan the prophet , and in the history of Gad the seer ,
with all his reign and his might , and the times that went over him , and over Israel , and over all the kingdoms of the countries .
Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom , and Yahweh his God was with him , and magnified him exceedingly .
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tent of Meeting of God , which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness .
but David had brought the Ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it ; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the bronze altar , that Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there .
Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh , which was at the tent of Meeting , and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it .
in that night God appeared to Solomon , and said to him , " Ask what I shall give you . "
Solomon said to God , " You have shown great loving kindness to David my father , and have made me king in his place .
now , Yahweh God , let your promise to David my father be established ; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
now give me wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people ; for who can judge this your people , that is so great ? "
so Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon , from before the tent of Meeting , to Jerusalem ; and he reigned over Israel .
Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen : and he had one thousand four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , that he placed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue ; the king 's merchants purchased them from Kue .
they brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver , and a horse for one hundred fifty : and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Yahweh , and a house for his kingdom .
Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens , and eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains , and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them .
Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre , saying , " As you dealt with David my father , and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell , so deal with me .
" the house which I build is great ; for our God is great above all gods .
" send me also cedar trees , fir trees , and algum trees , out of Lebanon ; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon : and behold , my servants shall be with your servants ,
even to prepare me timber in abundance ; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful .
behold , I will give to your servants , the cutters who cut timber , twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat , and twenty thousand measures of barley , and twenty thousand baths of wine , and twenty thousand baths of oil . "
then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon , " Because Yahweh loves his people , he has made you king over them . "
now I have sent a skillful man , endowed with understanding , of Huram my father 's ,
" now therefore the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa ; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem . "
Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel , after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them ; and they were found one hundred fifty @-@ three thousand six hundred .
he set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens , and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains , and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah , where Yahweh appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
he began to build in the second day of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
the porch that was in front , its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cubits , and the height one hundred twenty ; and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
the greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood , which he overlaid with fine gold , and ornamented it with palm trees and chains .
he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty : and the gold was gold of Parvaim .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the thresholds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and engraved cherubim on the walls .
he made the most holy house : its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cubits , and its breadth twenty cubits ; and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold . he overlaid the upper rooms with gold .
in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work ; and they overlaid them with gold .
the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long : the wing of the one was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
the wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
the wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were toward the house .
he made the veil of blue , and purple , and crimson , and fine linen , and ornamented it with cherubim .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty @-@ five cubits high , and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
he made chains in the oracle , and put them on the tops of the pillars ; and he made one hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
he set up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin , and the name of that on the left Boaz .
then he made an altar of brass , twenty cubits its length , and twenty cubits its breadth , and ten cubits its height .
also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass ; and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it .
under it was the likeness of oxen , which encircled it , for ten cubits , encircling the sea . the oxen were in two rows , cast when it was cast .
it stood on twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
it was a handbreadth thick ; and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup , like the flower of a Lily : it received and held three thousand baths .
he made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them ; and he set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . he made one hundred basins of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid their doors with brass .
he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward , toward the south .
Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basins . so Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God 's house :
the two pillars , and the bowls , and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars , and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ,
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars .
he made also the bases , and the basins made he on the bases ;
one sea , and the twelve oxen under it .
Huram his father also made the pots , the shovels , the forks , and all its vessels for king Solomon for the house of Yahweh of bright brass .
the king cast them in the plain of the Jordan , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah .
thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance : for the weight of the brass could not be found out .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in God 's house , the golden altar also , and the tables with the show bread on them ;
and the lampstands with their lamps , to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle , of pure gold ;
and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , of gold , and that perfect gold ;
and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the fire pans , of pure gold : and as for the entry of the house , the inner doors of it for the most holy place , and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished . Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated , even the silver , and the gold , and all the vessels , and put them in the treasuries of the house of God .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the princes of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel , to Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David , which is Zion .
and all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast , which was in the seventh month .
all the elders of Israel came : and the Levites took up the Ark ;
and they brought up the Ark , and the tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent ; these the priests the Levites brought up .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled to him , were before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh to its place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubim .
for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark , and the cherubim covered the Ark and its poles above .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
there was nothing in the Ark except the two tables which Moses put at Horeb , when Yahweh made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
it happened , when the priests had come out of the holy place , ( for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves , and didn 't keep their divisions ;
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of Yahweh filled God 's house .
then Solomon said , " Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness .
but I have built you a house of habitation , and a place for you to dwell in forever . "
the king turned his face , and blessed all the assembly of Israel : and all the assembly of Israel stood .
he said , " blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David my father , and has with his hands fulfilled it , saying ,
but I have chosen Jerusalem , that my name might be there ; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel . '
now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
but Yahweh said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart :
nevertheless you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
" Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as Yahweh promised , and have built the house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
there I have set the Ark , in which is the Covenant of Yahweh , which he made with the children of Israel . "
he stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
now therefore , Yahweh , the God of Israel , let your word be verified , which you spoke to your servant David .
" but will God indeed dwell with men on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain you ; how much less this house which I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and to his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night , even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name ; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place .
listen to the petitions of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : yes , hear from your dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when you hear , forgive .
" if a man sin against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swears before your altar in this house ;
then hear from heaven , and do , and judge your servants , bringing retribution to the wicked , to bring his way on his own head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
" if your people Israel be struck down before the enemy , because they have sinned against you , and shall turn again and confess your name , and pray and make supplication before you in this house ;
then hear from heaven , and forgive the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you afflict them :
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
" if there is famine in the land , if there is pestilence , if there is blight or mildew , locust or caterpillar ; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities ; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is ;
whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear from heaven , your dwelling place and forgive , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of the children of men ; )
that they may fear you , to walk in your ways , so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers .
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come from a far country for your great name 's sake , and your mighty hand , and your outstretched arm ; when they shall come and pray toward this house :
" if your people go out to battle against their enemies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their cause .
" if they sin against you ( for there is no man who doesn 't sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near ;
yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity , saying , ' We have sinned , we have done perversely , and have dealt wickedly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity , where they have carried them captive , and pray toward their land , which you gave to their fathers , and the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name :
then hear from heaven , even from your dwelling place , their prayer and their petitions , and maintain their cause , and forgive your people who have sinned against you .
" now , my God , let , I beg you , your eyes be open , and let your ears be attentive , to the prayer that is made in this place .
" now therefore arise , Yahweh God , into your resting place , you , and the Ark of your strength : let your priests , Yahweh God , be clothed with salvation , and let your saints rejoice in Goodness .
" Yahweh God , don 't turn away the face of your anointed . remember your loving kindnesses to David your servant . "
now when Solomon had made an end of praying , the fire came down from heaven , and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices ; and the glory of Yahweh filled the house .
the priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh , because the glory of Yahweh filled Yahweh 's house .
then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Yahweh .
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty @-@ two thousand head of cattle , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the people dedicated God 's house .
so Solomon held the feast at that time seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great assembly , from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt .
on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly : for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days , and the feast seven days .
on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents , joyful and glad of heart for the Goodness that Yahweh had shown to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house : and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of Yahweh , and in his own house .
Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him , " I have heard your prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
" if I shut up the sky so that there is no rain , or if I command the locust to devour the land , or if I send pestilence among my people ;
if my people , who are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
now my eyes shall be open , and my ears attentive , to the prayer that is made in this place .
for now have I chosen and made this house holy , that my name may be there forever ; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom , according as I covenanted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel . '
but if you turn away , and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
this house , which is so high , everyone who passes by it shall be astonished , and shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh , and his own house ,
that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
Solomon went to Hamath Zobah , and prevailed against it .
he built Tadmor in the wilderness , and all the storage cities , which he built in Hamath .
also he built Beth Horon the upper , and Beth Horon the lower , fortified cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
and Baalath , and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and all the cities for his chariots , and the cities for his horsemen , and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people who were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ;
of their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel didn 't consume , of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day .
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
these were the chief officers of king Solomon , even two @-@ hundred fifty , who ruled over the people .
then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh , which he had built before the porch ,
even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the Sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the set feasts , three times in the year , in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tents .
they didn 't depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh , and until it was finished . so the house of Yahweh was completed .
then went Solomon to Ezion Geber , and to Eloth , on the seashore in the land of Edom .
Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants ; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
Solomon told her all her questions ; and there was not anything hidden from Solomon which he didn 't tell her .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
however I didn 't believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and behold , the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me : you exceed the fame that I heard .
happy are your men , and happy are these your servants , who stand continually before you , and hear your wisdom .
she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold , and spices in great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon .
the servants also of Huram , and the servants of Solomon , who brought gold from Ophir , brought algum trees and precious stones .
King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides that which she had brought to the king . so she turned , and went to her own land , she and her servants .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty @-@ six talents of gold ,
besides that which the traders and merchants brought : and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon .
King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold ; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler .
he made three hundred shields of beaten gold ; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
moreover the king made a great throne of Ivory , and overlaid it with pure gold .
and there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any kingdom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
for the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram ; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish , bringing gold , and silver , Ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
so king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom .
all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
they brought every man his tribute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clothing , armor , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , that he stationed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
he ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines , and to the border of Egypt .
the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt , and out of all lands .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , aren 't they written in the history of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years .
Solomon slept with his fathers , and he was buried in the city of David his father : and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place .
Rehoboam went to Shechem ; for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king .
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it , ( for he was in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
they sent and called him ; and Jeroboam and all Israel came , and they spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
" your father made our yoke grievous : now therefore make you the grievous service of your father , and his heavy yoke which he put on us , lighter , and we will serve you . "
he said to them , " Come again to me after three days . " the people departed .
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
they spoke to him , saying , " If you are kind to this people , and please them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you , saying , ' Your father made our yoke heavy , but make it lighter on us ; ' thus you shall say to them , ' My little finger is thicker than my father 's waist .
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke . my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with Scorpions . ' "
so Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king asked , saying , " Come to me again the third day . "
so the king didn 't listen to the people ; for it was brought about of God , that Yahweh might establish his word , which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
but as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get himself up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
so Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day .
when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
" speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin , saying ,
Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem , and built cities for defense in Judah .
and Zorah , and Aijalon , and Hebron , which are in Judah and in Benjamin , fortified cities .
he fortified the strongholds , and put captains in them , and stores of food , and oil and wine .
he put shields and spears in every city , and made them exceeding strong . Judah and Benjamin belonged to him .
the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Yahweh ;
and he appointed him priests for the high places , and for the male goats , and for the calves which he had made .
after them , out of all the tribes of Israel , such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
so they strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong , three years ; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon .
Rehoboam took him a wife , Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David , and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse ;
and she bore him sons : Jeush , and Shemariah , and Zaham .
after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom ; and she bore him Abijah , and Attai , and Ziza , and Shelomith .
Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took Eighteen wives , and sixty concubines , and became the father of twenty @-@ eight sons and sixty daughters . )
Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief , the prince among his brothers ; for he intended to make him king .
he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin , to every fortified city : and he gave them food in abundance . he sought for them many wives .
it happened , when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established , and he was strong , that he forsook the law of Yahweh , and all Israel with him .
it happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , because they had trespassed against Yahweh ,
with twelve hundred chariots , and sixty thousand horsemen . the people were without number who came with him out of Egypt : the Lubim , the Sukkiim , and the Ethiopians .
he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah , and came to Jerusalem .
then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves ; and they said , " Yahweh is righteous . "
nevertheless they shall be his servants , that they may know my service , and the service of the kingdoms of the countries . "
so Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house . he took it all away . he also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Yahweh , the guard came and bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
when he humbled himself , the wrath of Yahweh turned from him , so as not to destroy him altogether : and moreover in Judah there were good things found .
he did that which was evil , because he didn 't set his heart to seek Yahweh .
now the acts of Rehoboam , first and last , aren 't they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer , after the way of genealogies ? there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David : and Abijah his son reigned in his place .
in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah .
he reigned three years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah . there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam .
Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim , which is in the hill country of Ephraim , and said , " Hear me , Jeroboam and all Israel :
ought you not to know that Yahweh , the God of Israel , gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever , even to him and to his sons by a Covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and rebelled against his lord .
there were gathered to him worthless men , base fellows , who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted , and could not withstand them .
" now you think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David ; and you are a great multitude , and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods .
" but as for us , Yahweh is our God , and we have not forsaken him ; and we have priests ministering to Yahweh , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites in their work :
behold , God is with us at our head , and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you . children of Israel , don 't fight against Yahweh , the God of your fathers ; for you shall not prosper . "
but Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them : so they were before Judah , and the ambush was behind them .
when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind them ; and they cried to Yahweh , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it happened , that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
the children of Israel fled before Judah ; and God delivered them into their hand .
Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter : so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied on Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
Abijah pursued after Jeroboam , and took cities from him , Bethel with its towns , and Jeshanah with its towns , and Ephron with its towns .
Jeroboam didn 't recover strength again in the days of Abijah . Yahweh struck him , and he died .
but Abijah grew mighty , and took to himself fourteen wives , and became the father of twenty @-@ two sons , and sixteen daughters .
the rest of the acts of Abijah , and his ways , and his sayings , are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo .
so Abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David ; and ASA his son reigned in his place . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
ASA did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God :
for he took away the foreign altars , and the high places , and broke down the pillars , and cut down the Asherim ,
and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
he built fortified cities in Judah ; for the land was quiet , and he had no war in those years , because Yahweh had given him rest .
there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops , and three hundred chariots ; and he came to Mareshah .
then ASA went out to meet him , and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah .
so Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before ASA , and before Judah ; and the Ethiopians fled .
ASA and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar : and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves ; for they were destroyed before Yahweh , and before his army ; and they carried away very much booty .
they struck all the cities around Gerar ; for the fear of Yahweh came on them : and they despoiled all the cities ; for there was much spoil in them .
they struck also the tents of livestock , and carried away sheep in abundance , and camels , and returned to Jerusalem .
the Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded :
now for a long time Israel was without the true God , and without a teaching priest , and without law .
but when in their distress they turned to Yahweh , the God of Israel , and sought him , he was found by them .
in those times there was no peace to him who went out , nor to him who came in ; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands .
they were broken in pieces , nation against nation , and city against city ; for God troubled them with all adversity .
but you be strong , and don 't let your hands be Slack ; for your work shall be rewarded . "
so they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of ASA .
they sacrificed to Yahweh in that day , of the spoil which they had brought , seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep .
they entered into the Covenant to seek Yahweh , the God of their fathers , with all their heart and with all their soul ;
and that whoever would not seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
they swore to Yahweh with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
all Judah rejoiced at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and Yahweh gave them rest all around .
also Maacah , the mother of ASA the king , he removed from being queen , because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah ; and ASA cut down her image , and made dust of it , and burnt it at the Brook Kidron .
but the high places were not taken away out of Israel : nevertheless the heart of ASA was perfect all his days .
he brought into God 's house the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
there was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of ASA .
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of ASA , Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to ASA king of Judah .
then ASA brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria , who lived at Damascus , saying ,
Ben Hadad listened to king ASA , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they struck Ijon , and Dan , and Abel Maim , and all the storage cities of Naphtali .
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and let his work cease .
then ASA the king took all Judah ; and they carried away the stones of Ramah , and its timber , with which Baasha had built ; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah .
at that time Hanani the seer came to ASA king of Judah , and said to him , " Because you have relied on the king of Syria , and have not relied on Yahweh your God , therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand .
Weren 't the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army , with chariots and horsemen exceeding many ? yet , because you relied on Yahweh , he delivered them into your hand .
for the eyes of Yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth , to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . herein you have done foolishly ; for from henceforth you shall have wars . "
then ASA was angry with the seer , and put him in the prison ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . ASA oppressed some of the people at the same time .
behold , the acts of ASA , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
in the thirty @-@ ninth year of his reign ASA was diseased in his feet ; his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he didn 't seek Yahweh , but to the physicians .
ASA slept with his fathers , and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign .
Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place , and strengthened himself against Israel .
he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which ASA his father had taken .
Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat , because he walked in the first ways of his father David , and didn 't seek the Baals ,
but sought to the God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand ; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute ; and he had riches and honor in abundance .
his heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh : and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah .
also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes , even Ben hail , and Obadiah , and Zechariah , and Nethanel , and Micaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah ;
and with them the Levites , even Shemaiah , and Nethaniah , and Zebadiah , and Asahel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehonathan , and Adonijah , and Tobijah , and Tobadonijah , the Levites ; and with them Elishama and Jehoram , the priests .
they taught in Judah , having the book of the law of Yahweh with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught among the people .
the fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah , so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents , and silver for tribute ; the Arabians also brought him flocks , seven thousand and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats .
Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly ; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store .
he had many works in the cities of Judah ; and men of war , mighty men of valor , in Jerusalem .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand ;
and next to him Jehohanan the captain , and with him two hundred eighty thousand ;
and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself to Yahweh ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor .
of Benjamin : Eliada a mighty man of valor , and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield ;
and next to him Jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready prepared for war .
these were those who waited on the king , besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah .
now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance ; and he joined affinity with Ahab .
after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria . Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance , and for the people who were with him , and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead .
Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , " Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh . "
but Jehoshaphat said , " Isn 't there here a prophet of Yahweh besides , that we may inquire of him ? "
then the king of Israel called an officer , and said , " Get Micaiah the son of Imla quickly . "
now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron , and said , " Thus says Yahweh , ' With these you shall push the Syrians , until they are consumed . ' "
all the prophets prophesied so , saying , " Go up to Ramoth Gilead , and prosper ; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king . "
Micaiah said , " As Yahweh lives , what my God says , that will I speak . "
the king said to him , " How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh ? "
he said , " I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd . Yahweh said , ' These have no master . let them return every man to his house in peace . ' "
the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , " Didn 't I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me , but evil ? "
Micaiah said , " Therefore hear the word of Yahweh : I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne , and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left .
Yahweh said , ' Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead ? ' one spoke saying in this way , and another saying in that way .
a spirit came out , stood before Yahweh , and said , ' I will entice him . ' " Yahweh said to him , ' How ? '
" he said , ' I will go forth , and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets . ' " he said , ' You will entice him , and will prevail also . go forth , and do so . '
" now therefore , behold , Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets ; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you . "
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you ? "
Micaiah said , " behold , you shall see on that day , when you shall go into an inner room to hide yourself . "
the king of Israel said , " Take Micaiah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
and say , ' Thus says the king , " Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I return in peace . " ' "
Micaiah said , " If you return at all in peace , Yahweh has not spoken by me . " he said , " listen , you peoples , all of you ! "
so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead .
the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went into the battle .
now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots , saying , " Fight neither with small nor great , except only with the king of Israel . "
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " It is the king of Israel ! " therefore they turned around to fight against him . but Jehoshaphat cried out , and Yahweh helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a certain man drew his bow at random , and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor . therefore he said to the driver of the chariot , " Turn your hand , and carry me out of the army ; for I am severely wounded . "
the battle increased that day . however the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening ; and about the time of the going down of the sun , he died .
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem .
Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him , and said to king Jehoshaphat , " Should you help the wicked , and love those who hate Yahweh ? because of this , wrath is on you from before Yahweh .
nevertheless there are good things found in you , in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land , and have set your heart to seek God . "
Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem : and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim , and brought them back to Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah , city by city ,
and said to the judges , " consider what you do : for you don 't judge for man , but for Yahweh ; and he is with you in the judgment .
now therefore let the fear of Yahweh be on you . take heed and do it : for there is no iniquity with Yahweh our God , nor respect of persons , nor taking of bribes . "
moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests , and of the heads of the fathers ' households of Israel , for the judgment of Yahweh , and for controversies . they returned to Jerusalem .
he commanded them , saying , " Thus you shall do in the fear of Yahweh , faithfully , and with a perfect heart .
it happened after this , that the children of Moab , and the children of Ammon , and with them some of the Ammonites , came against Jehoshaphat to battle .
then some came who told Jehoshaphat , saying , " A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Syria . behold , they are in Hazazon Tamar " ( that is , En Gedi ) .
Jehoshaphat was alarmed , and set himself to seek to Yahweh . he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah .
Judah gathered themselves together , to seek help from Yahweh . they came out of all the cities of Judah to seek Yahweh .
Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem , in the house of Yahweh , before the new court ;
Didn 't you , our God , drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel , and give it to the seed of Abraham your friend forever ?
they lived in it , and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name , saying ,
behold , how they reward us , to come to cast us out of your possession , which you have given us to inherit .
our God , will you not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us ; neither know we what to do , but our eyes are on you . "
all Judah stood before Yahweh , with their little ones , their wives , and their children .
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , the Levite , of the sons of Asaph , in the midst of the assembly ;
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground ; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Yahweh , worshipping Yahweh .
the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites , stood up to praise Yahweh , the God of Israel , with an exceeding loud voice .
when they began to sing and to praise , Yahweh set ambushers against the children of Ammon , Moab , and Mount Seir , who had come against Judah ; and they were struck .
for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir , utterly to kill and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , everyone helped to destroy another .
when Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness , they looked at the multitude ; and behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and there were none who escaped .
on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah ; for there they blessed Yahweh : therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in their forefront , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
they came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets to the house of Yahweh .
the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries , when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel .
so the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet ; for his God gave him rest all around .
Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
he walked in the way of ASA his father , and didn 't turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh .
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani , which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel .
after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel . the same did very wickedly :
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish ; and they made the ships in Ezion Geber .
Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Jehoram his son reigned in his place .
he had brothers , the sons of Jehoshaphat : Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah ; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
their father gave them great gifts , of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with fortified cities in Judah : but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram , because he was the firstborn .
now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father , and had strengthened himself , he killed all his brothers with the sword , and various also of the princes of Israel .
Jehoram was thirty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
however Yahweh would not destroy the house of David , because of the Covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always .
in his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah , and made a king over themselves .
then Jehoram passed over with his captains , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , along with the captains of the chariots .
so Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day : then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand , because he had forsaken Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah , and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute , and led Judah astray .
a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet , saying , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of David your father , ' Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father , nor in the ways of ASA king of Judah ,
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute , like the house of Ahab did , and also have slain your brothers of your father 's house , who were better than yourself :
behold , Yahweh will strike with a great plague your people , and your children , and your wives , and all your substance ;
and you shall have great sickness by disease of your bowels , until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness , day by day . ' "
Yahweh stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines , and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians :
and they came up against Judah , and broke into it , and carried away all the substance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wives ; so that there was never a son left him , except Jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
after all this Yahweh struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease .
thirty @-@ two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years : and he departed without being desired ; and they buried him in the city of David , but not in the tombs of the kings .
the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place ; for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest . so Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned .
he also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab ; for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did the house of Ahab ; for they were his counselors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
he walked also after their counsel , and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead : and the Syrians wounded Joram .
it happened , when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab , that he found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah , ministering to Ahaziah , and killed them .
now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah .
he was with them hidden in God 's house six years : and Athaliah reigned over the land .
in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into Covenant with him .
they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the heads of fathers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
all the assembly made a Covenant with the king in God 's house . he said to them , " behold , the king 's son shall reign , as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David .
this is the thing that you shall do . a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be porters of the thresholds .
a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation . all the people shall be in the courts of Yahweh 's house .
but let no one come into the house of Yahweh , except the priests , and those who minister of the Levites . they shall come in , for they are holy , but all the people shall follow Yahweh 's instructions .
the Levites shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . whoever comes into the house , let him be slain . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
so the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded : and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sabbath ; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath ; for Jehoiada the priest didn 't dismiss the shift .
Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king David 's , which were in God 's house .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king , she came to the people into the house of Yahweh :
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
Jehoiada made a Covenant between himself , and all the people , and the king , that they should be Yahweh 's people .
all the people went to the house of Baal , and broke it down , and broke his altars and his images in pieces , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
he set the porters at the gates of the house of Yahweh , that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in .
he took the captains of hundreds , and the nobles , and the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of Yahweh : and they came through the upper gate to the king 's house , and set the king on the throne of the kingdom .
so all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was quiet . Athaliah they had slain with the sword .
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zibiah , of Beersheba .
Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest .
Jehoiada took for him two wives ; and he became the father of sons and daughters .
it happened after this , that Joash intended to restore the house of Yahweh .
for the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up God 's house ; and they also gave all the dedicated things of the house of Yahweh to the Baals .
so the king commanded , and they made a chest , and set it outside at the gate of the house of Yahweh .
they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness .
all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh ; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Yahweh , and also such as worked iron and brass to repair the house of Yahweh .
so the workmen worked , and the work of repairing went forward in their hands , and they set up God 's house in its state , and strengthened it .
but Jehoiada grew old and was full of days , and he died ; one hundred thirty years old was he when he died .
they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , and toward God and his house .
now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah , and made obeisance to the king . then the king listened to them .
they forsook the house of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and served the Asherim and the idols : and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness .
yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again to Yahweh ; and they testified against them : but they would not give ear .
they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Yahweh .
thus Joash the king didn 't remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but killed his son . when he died , he said , " May Yahweh look at it , and repay it . "
it happened at the end of the year , that the army of the Syrians came up against him : and they came to Judah and Jerusalem , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus .
these are those who conspired against him : Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess .
Amaziah was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan , of Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , but not with a perfect heart .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
he hired also one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver .
a man of God came to him , saying , " O king , don 't let the army of Israel go with you ; for Yahweh is not with Israel , with all the children of Ephraim .
but if you will go , take action , be strong for the battle . God will overthrow you before the enemy ; for God has power to help , and to overthrow . "
then Amaziah separated them , the army that had come to him out of Ephraim , to go home again : therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in fierce anger .
Amaziah took courage , and led forth his people , and went to the Valley of Salt , and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir .
the children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
now it happened , after that Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites , that he brought the gods of the children of Seir , and set them up to be his gods , and bowed down himself before them , and burned incense to them .
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent to him a prophet , who said to him , " Why have you sought after the gods of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers , and sent to Joash , the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
you say to yourself that you have struck Edom ; and your heart lifts you up to boast . now stay at home . why should you meddle with trouble , that you should fall , even you , and Judah with you ? ' "
but Amaziah would not listen ; for it was of God , that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they had sought after the gods of Edom .
so Joash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
Judah was defeated by Israel ; and they fled every man to his tent .
Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz , at Beth Shemesh , and brought him to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in God 's house with Obed @-@ Edom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years .
now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , aren 't they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ?
now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh , they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem . he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish , and killed him there .
they brought him on horses , and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah .
all the people of Judah took Uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
he built Eloth , and restored it to Judah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jechiliah , of Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that his father Amaziah had done .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yahweh , God made him to prosper .
he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and broke down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod ; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
God helped him against the Philistines , and against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal , and the Meunim .
the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah : and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt ; for he grew exceeding strong .
moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
the whole number of the heads of fathers ' households , even the mighty men of valor , was two thousand and six hundred .
under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , who made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
Uzziah prepared for them , even for all the army , shields , and spears , and helmets , and coats of mail , and bows , and stones for slinging .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did corruptly , and he trespassed against Yahweh his God ; for he went into Yahweh 's temple to burn incense on the altar of incense .
Azariah the priest went in after him , and with him eighty priests of Yahweh , who were valiant men :
Azariah the chief priest , and all the priests , looked on him , and behold , he was leprous in his forehead , and they thrust him out quickly from there ; yes , himself hurried also to go out , because Yahweh had struck him .
Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first and last , Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , wrote .
so Uzziah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , " He is a leper . " Jotham his son reigned in his place .
Jotham was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that his father Uzziah had done : however he didn 't enter into Yahweh 's temple . the people still did corruptly .
he built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh , and on the wall of Ophel he built much .
moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah , and in the forests he built castles and towers .
so Jotham became mighty , because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
Jotham slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David : and Ahaz his son reigned in his place .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , like David his father ;
but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel , and made also molten images for the Baals .
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
for Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day , all of them valiant men ; because they had forsaken Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , killed Maaseiah the king 's son , and Azrikam the ruler of the house , and Elkanah who was next to the king .
the children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids for yourselves . Aren 't there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God ?
now hear me therefore , and send back the captives , that you have taken captive from your brothers ; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you . "
then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against those who came from the war ,
so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly .
at that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him .
for again the Edomites had come and struck Judah , and carried away captives .
the Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland , and of the South of Judah , and had taken Beth Shemesh , and Aijalon , and Gederoth , and Soco with its towns , and Timnah with its towns , Gimzo also and its towns : and they lived there .
for Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel ; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah , and trespassed severely against Yahweh .
Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria came to him , and distressed him , but didn 't strengthen him .
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh , and out of the house of the king and of the princes , and gave it to the king of Assyria : but it didn 't help him .
in the time of his distress , he trespassed yet more against Yahweh , this same king Ahaz .
Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God 's house , and cut in pieces the vessels of God 's house , and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh ; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods , and provoked to anger Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
now the rest of his acts , and all his ways , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem ; for they didn 't bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place .
Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty @-@ five years old ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that David his father had done .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of Yahweh , and repaired them .
he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them together into the broad place on the east ,
and said to them , " listen to me , you Levites ! now sanctify yourselves , and sanctify the house of Yahweh , the God of your fathers , and carry out the filthiness out of the holy place .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh , and turned their backs .
also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel .
for , behold , our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this .
now it is in my heart to make a Covenant with Yahweh , the God of Israel , that his fierce anger may turn away from us .
my sons , don 't be negligent now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him , to minister to him , and that you should be his ministers , and burn incense . "
then the Levites arose , Mahath , the son of Amasai , and Joel the son of Azariah , of the sons of the Kohathites ; and of the sons of Merari , Kish the son of Abdi , and Azariah the son of Jehallelel ; and of the Gershonites , Joah the son of Zimmah , and Eden the son of Joah ;
they gathered their brothers , and sanctified themselves , and went in , according to the commandment of the king by the words of Yahweh , to cleanse the house of Yahweh .
the priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh , to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in Yahweh 's temple into the court of the house of Yahweh . the Levites took it , to carry it out abroad to the Brook Kidron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Yahweh ; and they sanctified the house of Yahweh in eight days : and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end .
then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace , and said , " We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh , and the altar of burnt offering , with all its vessels , and the table of show bread , with all its vessels .
moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign threw away when he trespassed , have we prepared and sanctified ; and behold , they are before the altar of Yahweh . "
then Hezekiah the king arose early , and gathered the princes of the city , and went up to the house of Yahweh .
so they killed the bulls , and the priests received the blood , and sprinkled it on the altar : and they killed the rams , and sprinkled the blood on the altar : they killed also the lambs , and sprinkled the blood on the altar .
they brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly ; and they laid their hands on them :
the Levites stood with the instruments of David , and the priests with the trumpets .
Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar . when the burnt offering began , the song of Yahweh began also , and the trumpets , together with the instruments of David king of Israel .
all the assembly worshiped , and the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded ; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
when they had made an end of offering , the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls , one hundred rams , and two hundred lambs : all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
the consecrated things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep .
also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace offerings , and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering . so the service of the house of Yahweh was set in order .
Hezekiah rejoiced , and all the people , because of that which God had prepared for the people : for the thing was done suddenly .
Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem , to keep the Passover to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the assembly in Jerusalem , to keep the Passover in the second month .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number , neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem .
the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly .
Don 't be like your fathers , and like your brothers , who trespassed against Yahweh , the God of their fathers , so that he gave them up to desolation , as you see .
so the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh , even to Zebulun : but they ridiculed them , and mocked them .
nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves , and came to Jerusalem .
also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart , to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Yahweh .
many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month , a very great assembly .
they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the Brook Kidron .
then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves : therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean , to sanctify them to Yahweh .
Yahweh listened to Hezekiah , and healed the people .
the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness ; and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day , singing with loud instruments to Yahweh .
the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days ; and they kept another seven days with gladness .
for Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
all the assembly of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Judah , rejoiced .
so there was great joy in Jerusalem ; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem .
then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people : and their voice was heard , and their prayer came up to his holy habitation , even to heaven .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings , for the morning and evening burnt offerings , and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths , and for the new moons , and for the set feasts , as it is written in the law of Yahweh .
moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might give themselves to the law of Yahweh .
the children of Israel and Judah , who lived in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep , and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God , and laid them by heaps .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps , they blessed Yahweh , and his people Israel .
then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps .
then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of Yahweh ; and they prepared them .
they brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully : and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler , and Shimei his brother was second .
Hezekiah did so throughout all Judah ; and he worked that which was good and right and faithful before Yahweh his God .
after these things , and this faithfulness , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fortified cities , and thought to win them for himself .
when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come , and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem ,
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
so many people gathered together , and they stopped all the springs , and the Brook that flowed through the midst of the land , saying , " Why should the kings of Assyria come , and find much water ? "
he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
" be strong and courageous , don 't be afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria , nor for all the multitude who is with him ; for there is a greater with us than with him .
with him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is Yahweh our God to help us , and to fight our battles . " the people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
after this , Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem , ( now he was before Lachish , and all his power with him ) , to Hezekiah king of Judah , and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem , saying ,
thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria , " In whom do you trust , that you remain under siege in Jerusalem ?
Doesn 't Hezekiah persuade you , to give you over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ' Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ? '
Don 't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
his servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God , and against his servant Hezekiah .
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
they spoke of the God of Jerusalem , as of the gods of the peoples of the earth , which are the work of men 's hands .
Hezekiah the king , and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz , prayed because of this , and cried to heaven .
thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem , and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah ; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth .
in those days Hezekiah was sick even to death : and he prayed to Yahweh ; and he spoke to him , and gave him a sign .
but Hezekiah didn 't render again according to the benefit done to him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wrath on him , and on Judah and Jerusalem .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Yahweh didn 't come on them in the days of Hezekiah .
Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor : and he provided him treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all kinds of goodly vessels ;
storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil ; and stalls for all kinds of animals , and flocks in folds .
moreover he provided him cities , and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance ; for God had given him very much substance .
this same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon , and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David . Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his good deeds , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz , in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death . Manasseh his son reigned in his place .
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ five years in Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down ; and he reared up altars for the Baals , and made Asheroth , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served them .
he built altars in the house of Yahweh , of which Yahweh said , " My name shall be in Jerusalem forever . "
he built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh .
he also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom ; and he practiced sorcery , and used enchantments , and practiced sorcery , and dealt with those who had familiar spirits , and with wizards : he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that they did more evil than the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel did .
Yahweh spoke to Manasseh , and to his people ; but they gave no heed .
therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria , who took Manasseh in chains , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
when he was in distress , he begged Yahweh his God , and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers .
he prayed to him ; and he was entreated by him , and heard his supplication , and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom . then Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God .
he took away the foreign gods , and the idol out of the house of Yahweh , and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Yahweh , and in Jerusalem , and cast them out of the city .
he built up the altar of Yahweh , and offered thereon sacrifices of peace offerings and of Thanksgiving , and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh , the God of Israel .
nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places , but only to Yahweh their God .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and his prayer to his God , and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel , behold , they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel .
his prayer also , and how God was entreated of him , and all his sin and his trespass , and the places in which he built high places , and set up the Asherim and the engraved images , before he humbled himself : behold , they are written in the history of Hozai .
so Manasseh slept with his fathers , and they buried him in his own house : and Amon his son reigned in his place .
Amon was twenty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did Manasseh his father ; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them .
he didn 't humble himself before Yahweh , as Manasseh his father had humbled himself ; but this same Amon trespassed more and more .
his servants conspired against him , and put him to death in his own house .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty @-@ one years in Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in the ways of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
he burnt the bones of the priests on their altars , and purged Judah and Jerusalem .
he did this in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon , even to Naphtali , around in their ruins .
he broke down the altars , and beat the Asherim and the engraved images into powder , and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel , and returned to Jerusalem .
they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh ; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house ;
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh , Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Yahweh given by Moses .
Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan .
Shaphan carried the book to the king , and moreover brought back word to the king , saying , " All that was committed to your servants , they are doing .
they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers , and into the hand of the workmen . "
Shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , " Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book . " Shaphan read therein before the king .
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he tore his clothes .
the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
so Hilkiah , and they whom the king had commanded , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter ; ) and they spoke to her to that effect .
she said to them , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : ' tell the man who sent you to me ,
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah .
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place , and it shall not be quenched . ' " '
but to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Yahweh , thus you shall tell him , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : " as touching the words which you have heard ,
then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem .
he caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand . the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the Covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem : and they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month .
he set the priests in their offices , and encouraged them to the service of the house of Yahweh .
prepare yourselves after your fathers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fathers ' house of the Levites .
kill the Passover , and sanctify yourselves , and prepare for your brothers , to do according to the word of Yahweh by Moses . "
Josiah gave to the children of the people , of the flock , lambs and young goats , all of them for the Passover offerings , to all who were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bulls : these were of the king 's substance .
Conaniah also , and Shemaiah and Nethanel , his brothers , and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad , the chiefs of the Levites , gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock , and five hundred head of cattle .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites by their divisions , according to the king 's commandment .
they killed the Passover , and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand , and the Levites flayed them .
they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of the children of the people , to offer to Yahweh , as it is written in the book of Moses . so they did with the cattle .
they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day , to keep the Passover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh , according to the commandment of king Josiah .
the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time , and the feast of unleavened bread seven days .
in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept .
after all this , when Josiah had prepared the temple , Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates : and Josiah went out against him .
the archers shot at king Josiah ; and the king said to his servants , " Take me away , because I am seriously wounded ! "
so his servants took him out of the chariot , and put him in the second chariot that he had , and brought him to Jerusalem ; and he died , and was buried in the tombs of his fathers . all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
Jeremiah lamented for Josiah : and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day ; and they made them an ordinance in Israel : and behold , they are written in the lamentations .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and his good deeds , according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh ,
and his acts , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and made him king in his father 's place in Jerusalem .
Joahaz was twenty @-@ three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God .
against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to Babylon .
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of Yahweh , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem :
and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God ; he didn 't humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Yahweh .
he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God : but he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
moreover all the chiefs of the priests , and the people , trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations ; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had made holy in Jerusalem .
Yahweh , the God of their fathers , sent to them by his messengers , rising up early and sending , because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
but they mocked the messengers of God , and despised his words , and scoffed at his prophets , until the wrath of Yahweh arose against his people , until there was no remedy .
all the vessels of God 's house , great and small , and the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes , all these he brought to Babylon .
they burnt God 's house , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all its palaces with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it .
he carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon ; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
" thus says Cyrus king of Persia , ' Yahweh , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
whoever there is among you of all his people , may his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem , which is in Judah , and build the house of Yahweh , the God of Israel ( he is God ) , which is in Jerusalem .
then the heads of fathers ' households of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with precious things , besides all that was willingly offered .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . Sheshbazzar brought all these up , when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem .
now these are the children of the province , who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon , and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah , everyone to his city ;
who came with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Seraiah , Reelaiah , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispar , Bigvai , Rehum , Baanah . the number of the men of the people of Israel :
the children of Parosh , two thousand one hundred seventy @-@ two .
the children of Shephatiah , three hundred seventy @-@ two .
the children of Arah , seven hundred seventy @-@ five .
the children of Pahathmoab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand eight hundred twelve .

the children of Azgad , one thousand two hundred twenty @-@ two .
the children of Adonikam , six hundred sixty @-@ six .
the children of Bigvai , two thousand fifty @-@ six .
the children of Adin , four hundred fifty @-@ four .
the children of Ater , of Hezekiah , ninety @-@ eight .
the children of Bezai , three hundred twenty @-@ three .
the children of Jorah , one hundred twelve .
the children of Hashum , two hundred twenty @-@ three .
the children of Gibbar , ninety @-@ five .
the men of Netophah , fifty @-@ six .
the children of Azmaveth , forty @-@ two .
the children of Kiriath Arim , Chephirah , and Beeroth , seven hundred forty @-@ three .
the children of Ramah and Geba , six hundred twenty @-@ one .
the men of Michmas , one hundred twenty @-@ two .
the men of Bethel and AI , two hundred twenty @-@ three .
the children of Magbish , one hundred fifty @-@ six .
the children of the other Elam , one thousand two hundred fifty @-@ four .
the children of Lod , Hadid , and Ono , seven hundred twenty @-@ five .
the children of Jericho , three hundred forty @-@ five .
the children of Senaah , three thousand six hundred thirty .
the priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy @-@ three .
the children of Immer , one thousand fifty @-@ two .
the children of Pashhur , one thousand two hundred forty @-@ seven .
the children of Harim , one thousand seventeen .
the Levites : the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel , of the children of Hodaviah , seventy @-@ four .
the singers : the children of Asaph , one hundred twenty @-@ eight .
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all one hundred thirty @-@ nine .
the Nethinim : the children of Ziha , the children of Hasupha , the children of Tabbaoth ,
the children of Keros , the children of Siaha , the children of Padon ,
the children of Lebanah , the children of Hagabah , the children of Akkub ,
the children of Hagab , the children of Shamlai , the children of Hanan ,
the children of Giddel , the children of Gahar , the children of Reaiah ,
the children of Rezin , the children of Nekoda , the children of Gazzam ,
the children of Uzza , the children of Paseah , the children of Besai ,
the children of Asnah , the children of Meunim , the children of Nephisim ,
the children of Bakbuk , the children of Hakupha , the children of Harhur ,
the children of Bazluth , the children of Mehida , the children of Harsha ,
the children of Barkos , the children of Sisera , the children of Temah ,
the children of Neziah , the children of Hatipha .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Hassophereth , the children of Peruda ,
the children of Jaalah , the children of Darkon , the children of Giddel ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Ami .
all the Nethinim , and the children of Solomon 's servants , were three hundred ninety @-@ two .
these were those who went up from Tel Melah , Tel Harsha , Cherub , Addan , and Immer ; but they could not show their fathers ' houses , and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred fifty @-@ two .
of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
these sought their place among those who were registered by genealogy , but they were not found : therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim .
the whole assembly together was forty @-@ two thousand three hundred sixty ,
besides their male servants and their female servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty @-@ seven : and they had two hundred singing men and singing women .
some of the heads of fathers ' households , when they came to the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem , offered willingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work sixty @-@ one thousand darics of gold , and five thousand minas of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
when the seventh month had come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem .
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the altar on its base ; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
they kept the feast of tents , as it is written , and offered the daily burnt offerings by number , according to the ordinance , as the duty of every day required ;
and afterward the continual burnt offering , the offerings of the new moons , of all the set feasts of Yahweh that were consecrated , and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to Yahweh .
from the first day of the seventh month , they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh ; but the foundation of Yahweh 's temple was not yet laid .
then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers , Kadmiel and his sons , the sons of Judah , together , to have the oversight of the workmen in God 's house : the sons of Henadad , with their sons and their brothers the Levites .
but many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers ' households , the old men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice . many also shouted aloud for joy ,
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people ; for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the noise was heard far away .
now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to Yahweh , the God of Israel ;
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah , and troubled them in building ,
and hired counselors against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of Darius king of Persia .
in the reign of Ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem .
in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and the rest of his companions , to Artaxerxes king of Persia ; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian , and set forth in the Syrian language .
Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort :
then Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions , the Dinaites , and the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Shushanchites , the Dehaites , the Elamites ,
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over , and set in the city of Samaria , and in the rest of the country beyond the River , and so forth , wrote .
this is the copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king : your servants the men beyond the River , and so forth .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tribute , custom , or toll , and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings .
now because we eat the salt of the palace , and it is not appropriate for us to see the king 's dishonor , therefore have we sent and informed the king ;
we inform the king that , if this city be built , and the walls finished , by this means you shall have no portion beyond the River .
then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor , and to Shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria , and in the rest of the country beyond the River : peace , and so forth .
the letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me .
I decreed , and search has been made , and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein .
there have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem , who have ruled over all the country beyond the River ; and tribute , custom , and toll , was paid to them .
make a decree now to cause these men to cease , and that this city not be built , until a decree shall be made by me .
take heed that you not be Slack herein : why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
then when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then ceased the work of God 's house which is at Jerusalem ; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia .
now the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem ; in the name of the God of Israel they prophesied to them .
then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build God 's house which is at Jerusalem ; and with them were the prophets of God , helping them .
at the same time came to them Tattenai , the governor beyond the River , and Shetharbozenai , and their companions , and said thus to them , " Who gave you a decree to build this house , and to finish this wall ? "
then we told them in this way , what the names of the men were who were making this building .
but the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews , and they did not make them cease , until the matter should come to Darius , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the copy of the letter that Tattenai , the governor beyond the River , and Shetharbozenai , and his companions the Apharsachites , who were beyond the River , sent to Darius the king ;
they sent a letter to him , in which was written thus : to Darius the king , all peace .
then we asked those elders , and said to them thus , " Who gave you a decree to build this house , and to finish this wall ? "
we asked them their names also , to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head .
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
but in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon , Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God .
the gold and silver vessels also of God 's house , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem , and brought into the temple of Babylon , those Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar , whom he had made governor ;
and he said to him , ' Take these vessels , go , put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let God 's house be built in its place . '
then the same Sheshbazzar came , and laid the foundations of God 's house which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now has it been in building , and yet it is not completed .
then Darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the archives , where the treasures were laid up in Babylon .
there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of Media , a scroll , and therein was thus written for a record :
now therefore , Tattenai , governor beyond the River , Shetharbozenai , and your companions the Apharsachites , who are beyond the River , you must stay far from there .
leave the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place .
that they may offer sacrifices of pleasant aroma to the God of heaven , and pray for the life of the king , and of his sons .
also I have made a decree , that whoever shall alter this word , let a beam be pulled out from his house , and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon ; and let his house be made a dunghill for this :
then Tattenai , the governor beyond the River , Shetharbozenai , and their companions , because Darius the king had sent a decree , did accordingly with all diligence .
this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king .
the children of Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy .
they offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve male goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
the children of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month .
for the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together ; all of them were pure : and they killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brothers the priests , and for themselves .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the captivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land , to seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , ate ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
for Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances .
now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest , the scribe , even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Yahweh , and of his statutes to Israel :
Artaxerxes , king of kings , to Ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the God of heaven , perfect and so forth .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Levites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
because you are sent of the king and his seven counselors , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of your God which is in your hand ,
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem ;
therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls , rams , lambs , with their meal offerings and their drink offerings , and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver before the God of Jerusalem .
whatever more shall be needful for the house of your God , which you shall have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king 's treasure house .
to one hundred talents of silver , and to one hundred measures of wheat , and to one hundred baths of wine , and to one hundred baths of oil , and salt without prescribing how much .
whatever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven ; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
also we inform you , that touching any of the priests and Levites , the singers , porters , Nethinim , or servants of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose tribute , custom , or toll , on them .
whoever will not do the law of your God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed on him with all diligence , whether it be to death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
blessed be Yahweh , the God of our fathers , who has put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to beautify the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem ;
now these are the heads of their fathers ' households , and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon , in the reign of Artaxerxes the king :
of the sons of Phinehas , Gershom . of the sons of Ithamar , Daniel . of the sons of David , Hattush .
of the sons of Shecaniah , of the sons of Parosh , Zechariah ; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males one hundred fifty .
of the sons of Pahathmoab , Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah ; and with him two hundred males .
of the sons of Shecaniah , the son of Jahaziel ; and with him three hundred males .
of the sons of Adin , Ebed the son of Jonathan ; and with him fifty males .
of the sons of Elam , Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah ; and with him seventy males .
of the sons of Shephatiah , Zebadiah the son of Michael ; and with him eighty males .
of the sons of Joab , Obadiah the son of Jehiel ; and with him two hundred and Eighteen males .
of the sons of Shelomith , the son of Josiphiah ; and with him one hundred sixty males .
of the sons of Bebai , Zechariah the son of Bebai ; and with him twenty @-@ eight males .
of the sons of Azgad , Johanan the son of Hakkatan ; and with him one hundred ten males .
of the sons of Adonikam , who were the last ; and these are their names : Eliphelet , Jeuel , and Shemaiah ; and with them sixty males .
of the sons of Bigvai , Uthai and Zabbud ; and with them seventy males .
I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava ; and there we encamped three days : and I viewed the people , and the priests , and found there none of the sons of Levi .
then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , who were teachers .
and Hashabiah , and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari , his brothers and their sons , twenty ;
and of the Nethinim , whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinim : all of them were mentioned by name .
so we fasted and begged our God for this : and he was entreated of us .
then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests , even Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their brothers with them ,
and weighed to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering for the house of our God , which the king , and his counselors , and his princes , and all Israel there present , had offered :
I weighed into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver , and silver vessels one hundred talents ; of gold one hundred talents ;
and twenty bowls of gold , of one thousand darics ; and two vessels of fine bright brass , precious as gold .
I said to them , " You are holy to Yahweh , and the vessels are holy ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh , the God of your fathers .
watch , and keep them , until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites , and the princes of the fathers ' households of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the rooms of the house of Yahweh . "
so the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God .
we came to Jerusalem , and stayed there three days .
the whole by number and by weight : and all the weight was written at that time .
they delivered the king 's commissions to the king 's satraps , and to the governors beyond the River : and they furthered the people and God 's house .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons , so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass . "
when I heard this thing , I tore my garment and my robe , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down confounded .
then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of their trespass of the captivity ; and I sat confounded until the evening offering .
at the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation , even with my garment and my robe torn ; and I fell on my knees , and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God ;
and I said , " My God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our iniquities have increased over our head , and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens .
Shecaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , answered Ezra , " We have trespassed against our God , and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land . yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing .
arise ; for the matter belongs to you , and we are with you . be courageous , and do it . "
then Ezra arose , and made the chiefs of the priests , the Levites , and all Israel , to swear that they would do according to this word . so they swore .
then Ezra rose up from before God 's house , and went into the room of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib : and when he came there , he ate no bread , nor drank water ; for he mourned because of their trespass of the captivity .
they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem ;
and that whoever didn 't come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity .
Ezra the priest stood up , and said to them , " You have trespassed , and have married foreign women , to increase the guilt of Israel .
now therefore make confession to Yahweh , the God of your fathers , and do his pleasure ; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land , and from the foreign women . "
then all the assembly answered with a loud voice , " As you have said concerning us , so must we do .
only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this ; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them .
the children of the captivity did so . Ezra the priest , with certain heads of fathers ' households , after their fathers ' houses , and all of them by their names , were set apart ; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
they made an end with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month .
among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women : of the sons of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and his brothers , Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
they gave their hand that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt .
of the sons of Immer : Hanani and Zebadiah .
of the sons of Harim : Maaseiah , and Elijah , and Shemaiah , and Jehiel , and Uzziah .
of the sons of Pashhur : Elioenai , Maaseiah , Ishmael , Nethanel , Jozabad , and Elasah .
of the Levites : Jozabad , and Shimei , and Kelaiah ( the same is Kelita ) , Pethahiah , Judah , and Eliezer .
of the singers : Eliashib . of the porters : Shallum , and Telem , and Uri .
of Israel : of the sons of Parosh : Ramiah , and Izziah , and Malchijah , and Mijamin , and Eleazar , and Malchijah , and Benaiah .
of the sons of Elam : Mattaniah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , and Abdi , and Jeremoth , and Elijah .
of the sons of Zattu : Elioenai , Eliashib , Mattaniah , and Jeremoth , and Zabad , and Aziza .
of the sons of Bebai : Jehohanan , Hananiah , Zabbai , Athlai .
of the sons of Bani : Meshullam , Malluch , and Adaiah , Jashub , and Sheal , Jeremoth .
of the sons of Pahathmoab : Adna , and Chelal , Benaiah , Maaseiah , Mattaniah , Bezalel , and Binnui , and Manasseh .
of the sons of Harim : Eliezer , Isshijah , Malchijah , Shemaiah , Shimeon ,
of the sons of Hashum : Mattenai , Mattattah , Zabad , Eliphelet , Jeremai , Manasseh , Shimei .
of the sons of Bani : Maadai , Amram , and Uel ,
and Bani , and Binnui , Shimei ,
of the sons of Nebo : Jeiel , Mattithiah , Zabad , Zebina , Iddo , and Joel , Benaiah .
all these had taken foreign wives ; and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
the words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah . now it happened in the month Chislev , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the palace ,
that Hanani , one of my brothers , came , he and certain men out of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
they said to me , " The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach . the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and its gates are burned with fire . "
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days ; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven ,
and said , " I beg you , Yahweh , the God of heaven , the great and awesome God , who keeps Covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments :
we have dealt very corruptly against you , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the ordinances , which you commanded your servant Moses .
" remember , I beg you , the word that you commanded your servant Moses , saying , ' If you trespass , I will scatter you abroad among the peoples ;
but if you return to me , and keep my commandments and do them , though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens , yet will I gather them from there , and will bring them to the place that I have chosen , to cause my name to dwell there . '
" now these are your servants and your people , whom you have redeemed by your great power , and by your strong hand .
it happened in the month Nisan , in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king , when wine was before him , that I took up the wine , and gave it to the king . now I had not been sad before in his presence .
the king said to me , " Why is your face sad , since you are not sick ? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart . " then I was very much afraid .
I said to the king , " Let the king live forever ! why shouldn 't my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' tombs , lies waste , and its gates have been consumed with fire ? "
moreover I said to the king , " If it pleases the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River , that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah ;
then I came to the governors beyond the River , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
so I came to Jerusalem , and was there three days .
I arose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem ; neither was there any animal with me , except the animal that I rode on .
I went out by night by the valley gate , even toward the Jackal 's well , and to the Dung gate , and viewed the walls of Jerusalem , which were broken down , and its gates were consumed with fire .
then I went on to the spring gate and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass .
then went I up in the night by the Brook , and viewed the wall ; and I turned back , and entered by the valley gate , and so returned .
the rulers didn 't know where I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest who did the work .
but when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian , heard it , they ridiculed us , and despised us , and said , " What is this thing that you are doing ? will you rebel against the king ? "
then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests , and they built the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up its doors ; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it , to the tower of Hananel .
next to him built the men of Jericho . next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri .

after him , Nehemiah the son of Azbuk , the ruler of half the district of Beth Zur , made repairs to the place opposite the tombs of David , and to the pool that was made , and to the house of the mighty men .
after him , the Levites , Rehum the son of Bani made repairs . next to him , Hashabiah , the ruler of half the district of Keilah , made repairs for his district .
after him , their brothers , Bavvai the son of Henadad , the ruler of half the district of Keilah made repairs .
next to him , Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , repaired another portion , across from the ascent to the armory at the turning of the wall .
after him , Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion , from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest .
after him , Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another portion , from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib .

after him , Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another portion , from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall , and to the corner .

( now the Nethinim lived in Ophel , to the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the tower that stands out . )
after him the Tekoites repaired another portion , over against the great tower that stands out , and to the wall of Ophel .
above the horse gate , the priests made repairs , everyone across from his own house .

after him , Malchijah one of the goldsmiths to the house of the Nethinim , and of the merchants , made repairs over against the gate of Hammiphkad , and to the ascent of the corner .
between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate , the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs .
but it happened that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall , he was angry , and took great indignation , and mocked the Jews .
now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him , and he said , " What they are building , if a Fox climbed up it , he would break down their stone wall . "
Don 't cover their iniquity , and don 't let their sin be blotted out from before you ; for they have insulted the builders . "
so we built the wall ; and all the wall was joined together to half its height : for the people had a mind to work .
but it happened that when Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabians , the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward , and that the breaches began to be filled , then they were very angry ;
and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem , and to cause confusion therein .
but we made our prayer to our God , and set a watch against them day and night , because of them .
Judah said , " The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading , and there is much rubbish ; so that we are not able to build the wall . "
our adversaries said , " They shall not know , neither see , until we come into their midst , and kill them , and cause the work to cease . "
it happened that when the Jews who lived by them came , they said to us ten times from all places , " wherever you turn , they will attack us . "
therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , in the open places , I set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
it happened , when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their counsel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
it happened from that time forth , that half of my servants worked in the work , and half of them held the spears , the shields , and the bows , and the coats of mail ; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah .
they all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves ; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work , and with the other held his weapon ;
and the builders , everyone wore his sword at his side , and so built . he who sounded the trumpet was by me .
I said to the nobles , and to the rulers and to the rest of the people , " The work is great and large , and we are separated on the wall , one far from another .
wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet , rally there to us . our God will fight for us . "
so we worked in the work : and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may labor in the day . "
so neither I , nor my brothers , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard who followed me , none of us took off our clothes . everyone took his weapon to the water .
then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews .
for there were that said , " We , our sons and our daughters , are many . let us get grain , that we may eat and live . "
some also there were that said , " We are mortgaging our fields , and our vineyards , and our houses . let us get grain , because of the famine . "
there were also some who said , " We have borrowed money for the king 's tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral .
I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words .
also I said , " The thing that you do is not good . ought you not to walk in the fear of our God , because of the reproach of the nations our enemies ?
I likewise , my brothers and my servants , lend them money and grain . please let us stop this usury .
yes , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered there to the work .
moreover there were at my table , of the Jews and the rulers , one hundred fifty men , besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us .
remember to me , my God , for good , all that I have done for this people .
that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me , saying , " Come , let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono . " but they intended to harm me .
I sent messengers to them , saying , " I am doing a great work , so that I can 't come down . why should the work cease , while I leave it , and come down to you ? "
they sent to me four times after this sort ; and I answered them the same way .
then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand ,
you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem , saying , ' There is a king in Judah ! ' now it will be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together . "
then I sent to him , saying , " There are no such things done as you say , but you imagine them out of your own heart . "
I said , " Should such a man as I flee ? who is there that , being such as I , would go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go in . "
I discerned , and behold , God had not sent him ; but he pronounced this prophecy against me . Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him .
he hired so that I would be afraid , do so , and sin , and that they might have material for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
so the wall was finished in the twenty @-@ fifth day of Elul , in fifty @-@ two days .
it happened , when all our enemies heard of it , that all the nations that were about us were afraid , and were much cast down in their own eyes ; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God .
moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah , and Tobiah 's letters came to them .
for there were many in Judah sworn to him , because he was the son @-@ in @-@ law of Shecaniah the son of Arah ; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife .
also they spoke of his good deeds before me , and reported my words to him . Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear .
now it happened , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
that I put my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the governor of the castle , in charge of Jerusalem ; for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
now the city was wide and large ; but the people were few therein , and the houses were not built .
these are the children of the province , who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away , and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah , everyone to his city ;
who came with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Bigvai , Nehum , Baanah . the number of the men of the people of Israel :

the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , one hundred thirty @-@ eight .
the Nethinim : the children of Ziha , the children of Hasupha , the children of Tabbaoth ,
the children of Keros , the children of Sia , the children of Padon ,
the children of Lebana , the children of Hagaba , the children of Salmai ,
the children of Hanan , the children of Giddel , the children of Gahar ,
the children of Reaiah , the children of Rezin , the children of Nekoda ,
the children of Gazzam , the children of Uzza , the children of Paseah .
the children of Besai , the children of Meunim , the children of Nephushesim ,
the children of Bakbuk , the children of Hakupha , the children of Harhur ,
the children of Bazlith , the children of Mehida , the children of Harsha ,
the children of Barkos , the children of Sisera , the children of Temah ,
the children of Neziah , the children of Hatipha .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Sophereth , the children of Perida ,
the children of Jaala , the children of Darkon , the children of Giddel ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Amon .
all the Nethinim , and the children of Solomon 's servants , were three hundred ninety @-@ two .
these were those who went up from Tel Melah , Tel Harsha , Cherub , Addon , and Immer ; but they could not show their fathers ' houses , nor their seed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred forty @-@ two .
of the priests : the children of Hobaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
these searched for their geneological records , but couldn 't find them . therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim .
the whole assembly together was forty @-@ two thousand three hundred sixty ,
besides their male servants and their female servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty @-@ seven : and they had two hundred forty @-@ five singing men and singing women .
some from among the heads of fathers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred thirty priests ' garments .
some of the heads of fathers ' households gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold , and two thousand two hundred minas of silver .
that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold , and two thousand minas of silver , and sixty @-@ seven priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Levites , and the porters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the Nethinim , and all Israel , lived in their cities . when the seventh month had come , the children of Israel were in their cities .
Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly , both men and women , and all who could hear with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .
Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
and Ezra blessed Yahweh , the great God . all the people answered , " Amen , Amen , " with the lifting up of their hands . they bowed their heads , and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground .
also Jeshua , and Bani , and Sherebiah , Jamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodiah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Jozabad , Hanan , Pelaiah , and the Levites , caused the people to understand the law : and the people stayed in their place .
they read in the book , in the law of God , distinctly ; and they gave the sense , so that they understood the reading .
so the Levites stilled all the people , saying , " Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be grieved . "
all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared to them .
on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers ' households of all the people , the priests , and the Levites , to Ezra the scribe , even to give attention to the words of the law .
they found written in the law , how that Yahweh had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month ;
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves booths , everyone on the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim .
all the assembly of those who had come again out of the captivity made booths , and lived in the booths ; for since the days of Jeshua the son of nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so . there was very great gladness .
also day by day , from the first day to the last day , he read in the book of the law of God . they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly , according to the ordinance .
now in the twenty @-@ fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting , and with sackcloth , and earth on them .
the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners , and stood and confessed their sins , and the iniquities of their fathers .
they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day ; and a fourth part they confessed , and worshiped Yahweh their God .
then Jeshua , and Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani of the Levites stood up on the stairs , and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God .
you are Yahweh , the God who chose Abram , and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gave him the name of Abraham ,
" you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt , and heard their cry by the Red Sea ,
and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh , and against all his servants , and against all the people of his land ; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them , and made a name for yourself , as it is this day .
you divided the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and you cast their pursuers into the depths , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover , in a pillar of cloud you led them by day ; and in a pillar of fire by night , to give them light in the way in which they should go .
" you came down also on Mount Sinai , and spoke with them from heaven , and gave them right ordinances and true laws , good statutes and commandments ,
and made known to them your holy Sabbath , and commanded them commandments , and statutes , and a law , by Moses your servant ,
and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger , and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them .
" but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck , didn 't listen to your commandments ,
yes , when they had made them a molten calf , and said , ' This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ' and had committed awful blasphemies ;
you gave also your good Spirit to instruct them , and didn 't withhold your manna from their mouth , and gave them water for their thirst .
" yes , forty years you sustained them in the wilderness . they lacked nothing . their clothes didn 't grow old , and their feet didn 't swell .
moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples , which you allotted according to their portions . so they possessed the land of Sihon , even the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
you also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
" nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed awful blasphemies .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets . yet would they not give ear . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
" nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them , nor forsake them ; for you are a gracious and merciful God .
however you are just in all that has come on us ; for you have dealt truly , but we have done wickedly ;
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept your law , nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them .
for they have not served you in their kingdom , and in your great Goodness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their wicked works .
" behold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good , behold , we are servants in it .
it yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins : also they have power over our bodies , and over our livestock , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
yet for all this , we make a sure Covenant , and write it ; and our princes , our Levites , and our priests , seal it . "
now those who sealed were : Nehemiah the governor , the son of Hacaliah , and Zedekiah ,
Hattush , Shebaniah , Malluch ,
Maaziah , Bilgai , Shemaiah ; these were the priests .
the Levites : namely , Jeshua the son of Azaniah , Binnui of the sons of Henadad , Kadmiel ;
and their brothers , Shebaniah , Hodiah , Kelita , Pelaiah , Hanan ,
the chiefs of the people : Parosh , Pahathmoab , Elam , Zattu , Bani ,
and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons ;
and to bring the first fruits of our ground , and the first fruits of all fruit of all kinds of trees , year by year , to the house of Yahweh ;
also the firstborn of our sons , and of our livestock , as it is written in the law , and the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks , to bring to the house of our God , to the priests who minister in the house of our God ;
the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites , when the Levites take tithes : and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God , to the rooms , into the treasure house .
the princes of the people lived in Jerusalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city , and nine parts in the other cities .
the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem .
in Jerusalem lived certain of the children of Judah , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Judah : Athaiah the son of Uzziah , the son of Zechariah , the son of Amariah , the son of Shephatiah , the son of Mahalalel , of the children of Perez ;
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch , the son of Colhozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of the Shilonite .
all the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were four hundred sixty @-@ eight valiant men .
these are the sons of Benjamin : Sallu the son of Meshullam , the son of Joed , the son of Pedaiah , the son of Kolaiah , the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ithiel , the son of Jeshaiah .
after him Gabbai , Sallai , nine hundred twenty @-@ eight .
Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer ; and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city .
of the priests : Jedaiah the son of Joiarib , Jachin ,
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , the ruler of God 's house ,
and their brothers who did the work of the house , eight hundred twenty @-@ two ; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pelaliah , the son of Amzi , the son of Zechariah , the son of Pashhur , the son of Malchijah ,
and his brothers , chiefs of fathers ' households , two hundred forty @-@ two ; and Amashsai the son of Azarel , the son of Ahzai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
and their brothers , mighty men of valor , one hundred twenty @-@ eight ; and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of Haggedolim .
of the Levites : Shemaiah the son of Hasshub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Bunni ;
and Shabbethai and Jozabad , of the chiefs of the Levites , who had the oversight of the outward business of God 's house ;
all the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty @-@ four .
moreover the porters , Akkub , Talmon , and their brothers , who kept watch at the gates , were one hundred seventy @-@ two .
the residue of Israel , of the priests , the Levites , were in all the cities of Judah , everyone in his inheritance .
but the Nethinim lived in Ophel : and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim .
for there was a commandment from the king concerning them , and a settled provision for the singers , as every day required .
Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel , of the children of Zerah the son of Judah , was at the king 's hand in all matters concerning the people .
as for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its towns , and in Dibon and its towns , and in Jekabzeel and its villages ,
and in Hazar Shual , and in Beersheba and its towns ,
and in Ziklag , and in Meconah and in its towns ,
and in En Rimmon , and in Zorah , and in Jarmuth ,
Zanoah , Adullam , and their villages , Lachish and its fields , Azekah and its towns . so they encamped from Beersheba to the valley of Hinnom .
the children of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward , at Michmash and Aija , and at Bethel and its towns ,
Lod , and Ono , the valley of craftsmen .
of the Levites , certain divisions in Judah settled in Benjamin 's territory .
now these are the priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua : Seraiah , Jeremiah , Ezra ,
Amariah , Malluch , Hattush ,
Shemaiah , and Joiarib , Jedaiah .
Sallu , Amok , Hilkiah , Jedaiah . these were the chiefs of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua .
moreover the Levites : Jeshua , Binnui , Kadmiel , Sherebiah , Judah , and Mattaniah , who was over the Thanksgiving , he and his brothers .
also Bakbukiah and Unno , their brothers , were over against them according to their offices .
Jeshua became the father of Joiakim , and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib , and Eliashib became the father of Joiada ,
and Joiada became the father of Jonathan , and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua .
in the days of Joiakim were priests , heads of fathers ' households : of Seraiah , Meraiah ; of Jeremiah , Hananiah ;
of Ezra , Meshullam ; of Amariah , Jehohanan ;
of Malluchi , Jonathan ; of Shebaniah , Joseph ;
of Iddo , Zechariah ; of Ginnethon , Meshullam ;
of Abijah , Zichri ; of Miniamin , of Moadiah , Piltai ;
of Bilgah , Shammua ; of Shemaiah , Jehonathan ;
and of Joiarib , Mattenai ; of Jedaiah , Uzzi ;
as for the Levites , in the days of Eliashib , Joiada , and Johanan , and Jaddua , there were recorded the heads of fathers ' households ; also the priests , in the reign of Darius the Persian .
the sons of Levi , heads of fathers ' households , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
the chiefs of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brothers over against them , to praise and give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , watch next to watch .
Mattaniah , and Bakbukiah , Obadiah , Meshullam , Talmon , Akkub , were porters keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates .
these were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor , and of Ezra the priest the scribe .
the sons of the singers gathered themselves together , both out of the plain around Jerusalem , and from the villages of the Netophathites ;
the priests and the Levites purified themselves ; and they purified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall , and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession . one went on the right hand on the wall toward the Dung gate ;
and after them went Hoshaiah , and half of the princes of Judah ,
and Azariah , Ezra , and Meshullam ,
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets : Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph ;
and his brothers , Shemaiah , and Azarel , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethanel , and Judah , Hanani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God ; and Ezra the scribe was before them .
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
and above the gate of Ephraim , and by the old gate , and by the fish gate , and the tower of Hananel , and the tower of Hammeah , even to the sheep gate : and they stood still in the gate of the guard .
so stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in God 's house , and I , and the half of the rulers with me ;
and the priests , Eliakim , Maaseiah , Miniamin , Micaiah , Elioenai , Zechariah , and Hananiah , with trumpets ;
and Maaseiah , and Shemaiah , and Eleazar , and Uzzi , and Jehohanan , and Malchijah , and Elam , and Ezer . the singers sang loud , with Jezrahiah their overseer .
they performed the duty of their God , and the duty of the purification , and so did the singers and the porters , according to the commandment of David , and of Solomon his son .
for in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers , and songs of praise and Thanksgiving to God .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
because they didn 't meet the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Balaam against them , to curse them : however our God turned the curse into a blessing .
it came to pass , when they had heard the law , that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude .
now before this , Eliashib the priest , who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God , being allied to Tobiah ,
but in all this , I was not at Jerusalem ; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king : and after certain days asked I leave of the king ,
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah , in preparing him a room in the courts of God 's house .
it grieved me severely : therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the room .
then I commanded , and they cleansed the rooms : and there brought I again the vessels of God 's house , with the meal offerings and the frankincense .
I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them ; so that the Levites and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
then I contended with the rulers , and said , " Why is God 's house forsaken ? " I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries .
remember me , my God , concerning this , and don 't wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for its observances .
there lived men of Tyre also therein , who brought in fish , and all kinds of wares , and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said to them , " What evil thing is this that you do , and profane the Sabbath day ?
so the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice .
then I testified against them , and said to them , " Why do you stay around the wall ? if you do so again , I will lay hands on you . " from that time on , they didn 't come on the Sabbath .
in those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod , of Ammon , and of Moab :
and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
I contended with them , and Cursed them , and struck certain of them , and plucked off their hair , and made them swear by God , " You shall not give your daughters to their sons , nor take their daughters for your sons , or for yourselves .
shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil , to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women ? "
one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son @-@ in @-@ law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
remember them , my God , because they have defiled the priesthood , and the Covenant of the priesthood , and of the Levites .
thus I cleansed them from all foreigners , and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites , everyone in his work ;
and for the wood offering , at times appointed , and for the first fruits . remember me , my God , for good .
now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus ( this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia , over one hundred twenty @-@ seven provinces ) ,
that in those days , when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him .
he displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days , even one hundred eighty days .
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace , both great and small , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
they gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds , including royal wine in abundance , according to the bounty of the king .
in accordance with the law , the drinking was not compulsory ; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleasure .
also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus .
but the queen Vashti refused to come at the king 's commandment by the eunuchs . therefore the king was very angry , and his anger burned in him .
then the king said to the wise men , who knew the times , ( for it was the king 's custom to consult those who knew law and judgment ;
" what shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law , because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs ? "
Memucan answered before the king and the princes , " Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king , but also to all the princes , and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus .
for this deed of the queen will become known to all women , causing them to show contempt for their husbands , when it is reported , ' King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she didn 't come . '
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom ( for it is great ) , all the wives will give their husbands honor , both great and small . "
this advice pleased the king and the princes , and the king did according to the word of Memucan :
for he sent letters into all the king 's provinces , into every province according to its writing , and to every people in their language , that every man should rule his own house , speaking in the language of his own people .
after these things , when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified , he remembered Vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
then the king 's servants who served him said , " Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king .
and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti . " the thing pleased the king , and he did so .
there was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ,
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives , because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known .
Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women 's house , to find out how Esther was doing , and what would become of her .
the young woman then came to the king like this : whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women 's house to the king 's house .
so Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month , which is the month Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
the king loved Esther more than all the women , and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he set the royal crown on her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
when the virgins were gathered together the second time , Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate .
Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people , as Mordecai had commanded her ; for Esther obeyed Mordecai , like she did when she was brought up by him .
in those days , while Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh , who were doorkeepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus .
this thing became known to Mordecai , who informed Esther the queen ; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai 's name .
when this matter was investigated , and it was found to be so , they were both hanged on a tree ; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king 's presence .
after these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , and advanced him , and set his seat above all the princes who were with him .
all the king 's servants who were in the king 's gate bowed down , and paid Homage to Haman ; for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mordecai didn 't bow down or pay him Homage .
then the king 's servants , who were in the king 's gate , said to Mordecai , " Why do you disobey the king 's commandment ? "
when Haman saw that Mordecai didn 't bow down , nor pay him Homage , Haman was full of wrath .
but he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone , for they had made known to him Mordecai 's people . therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even Mordecai 's people .
if it pleases the king , let it be written that they be destroyed ; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king 's business , to bring it into the king 's treasuries . "
the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews ' enemy .
the king said to Haman , " The silver is given to you , the people also , to do with them as it seems good to you . "
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that they should be ready against that day .
the couriers went forth in haste by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa . the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city of Shushan was perplexed .
now when Mordecai found out all that was done , Mordecai tore his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and wailed loudly and a bitterly .
he came even before the king 's gate , for no one is allowed inside the king 's gate clothed with sackcloth .
in every province , wherever the king 's commandment and his decree came , there was great mourning among the Jews , and fasting , and weeping , and wailing ; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
Esther 's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this , and the queen was exceedingly grieved . she sent clothing to Mordecai , to replace his sackcloth ; but he didn 't receive it .
then Esther called for Hathach , one of the king 's eunuchs , whom he had appointed to attend her , and commanded him to go to Mordecai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
so Hathach went out to Mordecai , to city square which was before the king 's gate .
Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai .
then Esther spoke to Hathach , and gave him a message to Mordecai :
they told to Mordecai Esther 's words .
then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther , " Don 't think to yourself that you will escape in the king 's house any more than all the Jews .
then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai ,
so Mordecai went his way , and did according to all that Esther had commanded him .
now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal clothing , and stood in the inner court of the king 's house , next to the king 's house . the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house , next to the entrance of the house .
when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court , she obtained favor in his sight ; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand . so Esther came near , and touched the top of the scepter .
then the king asked her , " What would you like , queen Esther ? what is your request ? it shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom . "
Esther said , " If it seems good to the king , let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him . "
then the king said , " Bring Haman quickly , so that it may be done as Esther has said . " so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
then Esther answered and said , " My petition and my request is this .
then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart , but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he didn 't stand up nor move for him , he was filled with wrath against Mordecai .
nevertheless Haman restrained himself , and went home . there , he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife .
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
Haman also said , " Yes , Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king .
yet all this avails me nothing , so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king 's gate . "
on that night , the king couldn 't sleep . he commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought , and they were read to the king .
the king said , " Who is in the court ? " now Haman had come into the outer court of the king 's house , to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
Mordecai came back to the king 's gate , but Haman hurried to his house , mourning and having his head covered .
while they were yet talking with him , the king 's eunuchs came , and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
so the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen .
the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition , queen Esther ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
then Esther the queen answered , " If I have found favor in your sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen , " Who is he , and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so ? "
Esther said , " An adversary and an enemy , even this wicked Haman ! " then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen .
so they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai . then was the king 's wrath pacified .
on that day , King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman , the Jews ' enemy , to Esther the queen . Mordecai came before the king ; for Esther had told what he was to her .
the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it to Mordecai . Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman .
Esther spoke yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter . so Esther arose , and stood before the king .
for how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people ? how can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew , " See , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged on the gallows , because he laid his hand on the Jews .
he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by Courier on horseback , riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds .
on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus , on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar .
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
so the couriers who rode on royal horses went out , hastened and pressed on by the king 's commandment . the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa .
the Jews had light , gladness , joy , and honor .
all the princes of the provinces , the satraps , the governors , and those who did the king 's business helped the Jews , because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them .
for Mordecai was great in the king 's house , and his fame went out throughout all the provinces ; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater .
the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and with slaughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who hated them .
in the citadel of Susa , the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men .
they killed Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
on that day , the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king .
then Esther said , " If it pleases the king , let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day 's decree , and let Haman 's ten sons be hanged on the gallows . "
the king commanded this to be done . a decree was given out in Shushan ; and they hanged Haman 's ten sons .
the Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and killed three hundred men in Shushan ; but they didn 't lay their hand on the spoil .
this was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar ; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
but the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month ; and on the fifteenth day of that month , they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
therefore the Jews of the villages , who live in the unwalled towns , make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting , a good day , and a day of sending presents of food to one another .
Mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus , both near and far ,
to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly ,
the Jews accepted the custom that they had begun , as Mordecai had written to them ;
because Haman the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , had plotted against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast " PUR , " that is the lot , to consume them , and to destroy them ;
but when this became known to the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he had devised against the Jews , should return on his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation , every family , every province , and every city ; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews , nor their memory perish from their seed .
then Esther the queen , the daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the Jew , wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim .
he sent letters to all the Jews , to the hundred twenty @-@ seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , with words of peace and truth ,
the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim ; and it was written in the book .
King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land , and on the islands of the sea .
all the acts of his power and of his might , and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai , to which the king advanced him , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
there was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job . that man was blameless and upright , and one who feared God , and turned away from evil .
there were born to him seven sons and three daughters .
his possessions also were seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred yoke of oxen , five hundred female donkeys , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east .
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
now it happened on the day when God 's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , that Satan also came among them .
Yahweh said to Satan , " Where have you come from ? " then Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . "
Yahweh said to Satan , " Have you considered my servant , Job ? for there is none like him in the earth , a blameless and an upright man , one who fears God , and turns away from evil . "
then Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " Does Job fear God for nothing ?
Yahweh said to Satan , " behold , all that he has is in your power . only on himself don 't put forth your hand . " so Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh .
it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
that there came a messenger to Job , and said , " The oxen were plowing , and the donkeys feeding beside them ,
and the Sabeans attacked , and took them away . yes , they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword , and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
then Job arose , and tore his robe , and shaved his head , and fell down on the ground , and worshiped .
he said , " naked I came out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return there . Yahweh gave , and Yahweh has taken away . blessed be the name of Yahweh . "
in all this , Job did not sin , nor charge God with wrongdoing .
again it happened on the day when the God 's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh .
Yahweh said to Satan , " Where have you come from ? " Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . "
Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " Skin for skin . yes , all that a man has he will give for his life .
Yahweh said to Satan , " behold , he is in your hand . only spare his life . "
so Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh , and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head .
he took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with , and he sat among the ashes .
then his wife said to him , " Do you still maintain your integrity ? renounce God , and die . "
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and didn 't recognize him , they raised their voices , and wept ; and they each tore his robe , and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky .
so they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights , and none spoke a word to him , for they saw that his grief was very great .
after this Job opened his mouth , and Cursed the day of his birth .
" let the day perish in which I was born , the night which said , ' There is a boy conceived . '
let that day be darkness . Don 't let God from above seek for it , neither let the light shine on it .
let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own . let a cloud dwell on it . let all that makes black the day terrify it .
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
behold , let that night be barren . let no joyful voice come therein .
let them curse it who curse the day , who are ready to rouse up leviathan .
let the stars of its twilight be dark . let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the eyelids of the morning ,
because it didn 't shut up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor did it hide trouble from my eyes .
" why didn 't I die from the womb ? why didn 't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me ?
why did the knees receive me ? or why the breast , that I should nurse ?
for now should I have lain down and been quiet . I should have slept , then I would have been at rest ,
with kings and counselors of the earth , who built up waste places for themselves ;
or with princes who had gold , who filled their houses with silver :
or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been , as infants who never saw light .
there the wicked cease from troubling . there the weary are at rest .
there the prisoners are at ease together . they don 't hear the voice of the taskmaster .
the small and the great are there . the servant is free from his master .
" why is light given to him who is in misery , life to the bitter in soul ,
who long for death , but it doesn 't come ; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures ,
who rejoice exceedingly , and are glad , when they can find the grave ?
why is light given to a man whose way is hidden , whom God has hedged in ?
for my sighing comes before I eat . my groanings are poured out like water .
for the thing which I fear comes on me , That which I am afraid of comes to me .
I am not at ease , neither am I quiet , neither have I rest ; but trouble comes . "
then Eliphaz the Temanite answered ,
" if someone ventures to talk with you , will you be grieved ? but who can withhold himself from speaking ?
behold , you have instructed many , you have strengthened the weak hands .
your words have supported him who was falling , You have made firm the feeble knees .
but now it has come to you , and you faint . it touches you , and you are troubled .
Isn 't your piety your confidence ? Isn 't the integrity of your ways your hope ?
" remember , now , whoever perished , being innocent ? or where were the upright cut off ?
according to what I have seen , those who plow iniquity , and sow trouble , reap the same .
by the breath of God they perish . by the blast of his anger are they consumed .
the roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , the teeth of the young lions , are broken .
the old lion perishes for lack of prey . the cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad .
" now a thing was secretly brought to me . my ear received a whisper of it .
in thoughts from the visions of the night , when deep sleep falls on men ,
fear came on me , and trembling , which made all my bones shake .
then a spirit passed before my face . the hair of my flesh stood up .
it stood still , but I couldn 't discern its appearance . a form was before my eyes . silence , then I heard a voice , saying ,
'Shall mortal man be more just than God ? shall a man be more pure than his Maker ?
behold , he puts no trust in his servants . he charges his angels with error .
how much more , those who dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , who are crushed before the moth !
between morning and evening they are destroyed . they perish forever without any regarding it .
Isn 't their tent cord plucked up within them ? they die , and that without wisdom . '
" call now ; is there any who will answer you ? to which of the holy ones will you turn ?
for resentment kills the foolish man , and jealousy kills the simple .
I have seen the foolish taking root , but suddenly I Cursed his habitation .
his children are far from safety . they are crushed in the gate . neither is there any to deliver them ,
whose harvest the hungry eats up , and take it even out of the thorns . the snare gapes for their substance .
for affliction doesn 't come forth from the dust , neither does trouble spring out of the ground ;
but man is born to trouble , as the sparks fly upward .
" but as for me , I would seek God . I would commit my cause to God ,
who does great things that can 't be fathomed , marvelous things without number ;
who gives rain on the earth , and sends waters on the fields ;
so that he sets up on high those who are low , those who mourn are exalted to safety .
he frustrates the devices of the crafty , So that their hands can 't perform their enterprise .
he takes the wise in their own craftiness ; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong .
they meet with darkness in the day time , and grope at noonday as in the night .
but he saves from the sword of their mouth , even the needy from the hand of the mighty .
so the poor has hope , and injustice shuts her mouth .
" behold , happy is the man whom God corrects . therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty .
for he wounds , and binds up . he injures , and his hands make whole .
he will deliver you in six troubles ; yes , in seven no evil shall touch you .
in famine he will redeem you from death ; in war , from the power of the sword .
you shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue , neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes .
at destruction and famine you shall laugh , neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth .
for you shall be allied with the stones of the field . the animals of the field shall be at peace with you .
you shall know that your tent is in peace . you shall visit your fold , and shall miss nothing .
you shall know also that your seed shall be great , Your offspring as the grass of the earth .
you shall come to your grave in a full age , like a shock of grain comes in its season .
look this , we have searched it , so it is . hear it , and know it for your good . "
then Job answered ,
" Oh that my anguish were weighed , and all my calamity laid in the balances !
for now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas , therefore have my words been rash .
for the arrows of the Almighty are within me . my spirit drinks up their poison . the terrors of God set themselves in array against me .
does the wild donkey bray when he has grass ? or does the ox low over his fodder ?
can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt ? or is there any taste in the white of an egg ?
my soul refuses to touch them . they are as loathsome food to me .
" Oh that I might have my request , that God would grant the thing that I long for ,
even that it would please God to crush me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
be it still my consolation , yes , let me exult in pain that doesn 't spare , that I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
what is my strength , that I should wait ? what is my end , that I should be patient ?
is my strength the strength of stones ? or is my flesh of brass ?
Isn 't it that I have no help in me , That wisdom is driven quite from me ?
" to him who is ready to faint , kindness should be shown from his friend ; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty .
my brothers have dealt deceitfully as a Brook , as the channel of brooks that pass away ;
which are black by reason of the ice , in which the snow hides itself .
in the dry season , they vanish . when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
the caravans that travel beside them turn aside . they go up into the waste , and perish .
they were distressed because they were confident . they came there , and were confounded .
for now you are nothing . you see a terror , and are afraid .
did I say , ' Give to me ? ' or , ' Offer a present for me from your substance ? '
" teach me , and I will hold my peace . cause me to understand wherein I have erred .
how forcible are words of uprightness ! but your reproof , what does it reprove ?
do you intend to reprove words , since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind ?
yes , you would even cast lots for the fatherless , and make merchandise of your friend .
now therefore be pleased to look at me , for surely I shall not lie to your face .
please return . let there be no injustice . yes , return again . my cause is righteous .
is there injustice on my tongue ? can 't my taste discern mischievous things ?
" Isn 't a man forced to labor on earth ? Aren 't his days like the days of a hired hand ?
as a servant who earnestly desires the shadow , as a hireling who looks for his wages ,
so am I made to possess months of misery , wearisome nights are appointed to me .
when I lie down , I say , ' When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? ' I Toss and turn until the dawning of the day .
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust . my skin closes up , and breaks out afresh .
my days are swifter than a weaver 's shuttle , and are spent without hope .
Oh remember that my life is a breath . my eye shall no more see good .
the eye of him who sees me shall see me no more . your eyes shall be on me , but I shall not be .
as the cloud is consumed and vanishes away , so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more .
he shall return no more to his house , neither shall his place know him any more .
" therefore I will not keep silent . I will speak in the anguish of my spirit . I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
am I a sea , or a sea Monster , that you put a guard over me ?
when I say , ' My bed shall comfort me . my couch shall ease my complaint ; '
then you scare me with dreams , and terrify me through visions :
so that my soul chooses strangling , death rather than my bones .
I loathe my life . I don 't want to live forever . leave me alone , for my days are but a breath .
what is man , that you should magnify him , that you should set your mind on him ,
that you should visit him every morning , and test him every moment ?
how long will you not look away from me , nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle ?
if I have sinned , what do I do to you , you watcher of men ? why have you set me as a mark for you , so that I am a burden to myself ?
why do you not pardon my disobedience , and take away my iniquity ? for now shall I lie down in the dust . you will seek me diligently , but I shall not be . "
then Bildad the Shuhite answered ,
" how long will you speak these things ? shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind ?
does God pervert justice ? or does the Almighty pervert righteousness ?
if your children have sinned against him , He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience .
if you want to seek God diligently , make your supplication to the Almighty .
if you were pure and upright , surely now he would awaken for you , and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous .
" please inquire of past generations . find out about the learning of their fathers .
( for we are but of yesterday , and know nothing , because our days on earth are a shadow . )
shall they not teach you , tell you , and utter words out of their heart ?
" can the papyrus grow up without mire ? can the rushes grow without water ?
while it is yet in its greenness , not cut down , it Withers before any other Reed .
so are the paths of all who forget God . the hope of the godless man shall perish ,
whose confidence shall break apart , whose trust is a spider 's web .
he shall lean on his house , but it shall not stand . he shall cling to it , but it shall not endure .
he is green before the sun . his shoots go forth over his garden .
his roots are wrapped around the rock pile . he sees the place of stones .
if he is destroyed from his place , then it shall deny him , saying , ' I have not seen you . '
behold , this is the joy of his way : out of the earth , others shall spring .
" behold , God will not cast away a blameless man , neither will he uphold the evildoers .
he will still fill your mouth with laughter , your lips with shouting .
those who hate you shall be clothed with shame . the tent of the wicked shall be no more . "
then Job answered ,
" truly I know that it is so , but how can man be just with God ?
if he is pleased to contend with him , he can 't answer him one time in a thousand .
God who is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who has hardened himself against him , and prospered ?
he removes the mountains , and they don 't know it , when he overturns them in his anger .
he shakes the earth out of its place . its pillars tremble .
he commands the sun , and it doesn 't rise , and seals up the stars .
he alone stretches out the heavens , and treads on the waves of the sea .
he makes the Bear , Orion , and the Pleiades , and the rooms of the south .
he does great things past finding out ; yes , marvelous things without number .
behold , he goes by me , and I don 't see him . he passes on also , but I don 't perceive him .
behold , he snatches away . who can hinder him ? who will ask him , ' What are you doing ? '
" God will not withdraw his anger . the helpers of Rahab stoop under him .
how much less shall I answer him , And choose my words to argue with him ?
though I were righteous , yet I wouldn 't answer him . I would make supplication to my judge .
if I had called , and he had answered me , yet I wouldn 't believe that he listened to my voice .
for he breaks me with a storm , and multiplies my wounds without cause .
he will not allow me to catch my breath , but fills me with bitterness .
if it is a matter of strength , behold , he is mighty ! if of justice , ' Who , ' says he , ' will summon me ? '
though I am righteous , my own mouth shall condemn me . though I am blameless , it shall prove me perverse .
I am blameless . I don 't respect myself . I despise my life .
" it is all the same . therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked .
if the scourge kills suddenly , he will mock at the trial of the innocent .
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked . he covers the faces of its judges . if not he , then who is it ?
" now my days are swifter than a runner . they flee away , they see no good ,
they have passed away as the swift ships , as the eagle that swoops on the prey .
if I say , ' I will forget my complaint , I will put off my sad face , and cheer up ; '
I am afraid of all my sorrows , I know that you will not hold me innocent .
I shall be condemned . why then do I labor in vain ?
if I wash myself with snow , and cleanse my hands with lye ,
yet you will plunge me in the ditch . my own clothes shall abhor me .
for he is not a man , as I am , that I should answer him , that we should come together in judgment .
there is no umpire between us , that might lay his hand on us both .
let him take his rod away from me . let his terror not make me afraid ;
then I would speak , and not fear him , for I am not so in myself .
" my soul is weary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
I will tell God , ' Do not condemn me . show me why you contend with me .
is it good to you that you should oppress , that you should despise the work of your hands , and smile on the counsel of the wicked ?
do you have eyes of flesh ? or do you see as man sees ?
are your days as the days of mortals , or your years as man 's years ,
that you inquire after my iniquity , and search after my sin ?
although you know that I am not wicked , there is no one who can deliver out of your hand .
" ' your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether , yet you destroy me .
remember , I beg you , that you have fashioned me as clay . will you bring me into dust again ?
haven 't you poured me out like milk , and curdled me like cheese ?
you have clothed me with skin and flesh , and knit me together with bones and sinews .
yet you hid these things in your heart . I know that this is with you :
if I sin , then you mark me . you will not acquit me from my iniquity .
if I am wicked , woe to me . if I am righteous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with disgrace , and conscious of my affliction .
if my head is held high , you hunt me like a lion . again you show yourself powerful to me .
you renew your witnesses against me , and increase your indignation on me . changes and warfare are with me .
" ' why , then , have you brought me forth out of the womb ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me .
I should have been as though I had not been . I should have been carried from the womb to the grave .
Aren 't my days few ? cease then . leave me alone , that I may find a little comfort ,
before I go where I shall not return from , to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death ;
the land dark as midnight , of the shadow of death , without any order , where the light is as midnight . ' "
then Zophar , the Naamathite , answered ,
" Shouldn 't the multitude of words be answered ? should a man full of talk be justified ?
should your boastings make men hold their peace ? when you mock , shall no man make you ashamed ?
for you say , ' My doctrine is pure . I am clean in your eyes . '
but oh that God would speak , and open his lips against you ,
that he would show you the secrets of wisdom ! for true wisdom has two sides . know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves .
" can you fathom the mystery of God ? or can you probe the limits of the Almighty ?
they are high as heaven . what can you do ? they are deeper than Sheol . what can you know ?
its measure is longer than the earth , and broader than the sea .
if he passes by , or confines , or convenes a court , then who can oppose him ?
for he knows false men . he sees iniquity also , even though he doesn 't consider it .
an empty @-@ headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey 's colt .
" if you set your heart aright , stretch out your hands toward him .
if iniquity is in your hand , put it far away . Don 't let unrighteousness dwell in your tents .
surely then you shall lift up your face without spot ; Yes , you shall be steadfast , and shall not fear :
for you shall forget your misery . you shall remember it as waters that are passed away .
life shall be clearer than the noonday . though there is darkness , it shall be as the morning .
you shall be secure , because there is hope . yes , you shall search , and shall take your rest in safety .
also you shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid . yes , many shall court your favor .
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail . they shall have no way to flee . their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit . "
then Job answered ,
" no doubt , but you are the people , and wisdom shall die with you .
but I have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to you . yes , who doesn 't know such things as these ?
I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor , I , who called on God , and he answered . the just , the blameless man is a joke .
in the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune . it is ready for them whose foot slips .
the tents of robbers prosper . those who provoke God are secure , who carry their God in their hands .
" but ask the animals , now , and they shall teach you ; the birds of the sky , and they shall tell you .
or speak to the earth , and it shall teach you . the fish of the sea shall declare to you .
who doesn 't know that in all these , the hand of Yahweh has done this ,
in whose hand is the life of every living thing , and the breath of all mankind ?
Doesn 't the ear try words , even as the palate tastes its food ?
with aged men is wisdom , in length of days understanding .
" with God is wisdom and might . he has counsel and understanding .
behold , he breaks down , and it can 't be built again . he imprisons a man , and there can be no release .
behold , he Withholds the waters , and they dry up . again , he sends them out , and they overturn the earth .
with him is strength and wisdom . the deceived and the deceiver are his .
he leads counselors away stripped . he makes judges fools .
he loosens the bond of kings . he binds their waist with a belt .
he leads priests away stripped , and overthrows the mighty .
he removes the speech of those who are trusted , and takes away the understanding of the elders .
he pours contempt on princes , and loosens the belt of the strong .
he uncovers deep things out of darkness , and brings out to light the shadow of death .
he increases the nations , and he destroys them . he enlarges the nations , and he leads them captive .
he takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth , and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way .
they grope in the dark without light . he makes them stagger like a drunken man .
" behold , my eye has seen all this . my ear has heard and understood it .
what you know , I know also . I am not inferior to you .
" surely I would speak to the Almighty . I desire to reason with God .
but you are forgers of lies . you are all physicians of no value .
Oh that you would be completely silent ! then you would be wise .
hear now my reasoning . listen to the pleadings of my lips .
will you speak unrighteously for God , and talk deceitfully for him ?
will you show partiality to him ? will you contend for God ?
is it good that he should search you out ? or as one deceives a man , will you deceive him ?
he will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality .
shall not his majesty make you afraid , And his dread fall on you ?
your memorable sayings are Proverbs of ashes , Your defenses are defenses of clay .
" be silent , leave me alone , that I may speak . let come on me what will .
why should I take my flesh in my teeth , and put my life in my hand ?
behold , he will kill me . I have no hope . nevertheless , I will maintain my ways before him .
this also shall be my salvation , that a godless man shall not come before him .
hear diligently my speech . let my declaration be in your ears .
see now , I have set my cause in order . I know that I am righteous .
who is he who will contend with me ? for then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit .
" only don 't do two things to me ; then I will not hide myself from your face :
withdraw your hand far from me ; and don 't let your terror make me afraid .
then call , and I will answer ; or let me speak , and you answer me .
how many are my iniquities and sins ? make me know my disobedience and my sin .
why hide you your face , and hold me for your enemy ?
will you harass a driven leaf ? will you pursue the dry stubble ?
for you write bitter things against me , and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth :
you also put my feet in the stocks , and mark all my paths . you set a bound to the soles of my feet ,
though I am decaying like a rotten thing , like a garment that is moth @-@ eaten .
" man , who is born of a woman , is of few days , and full of trouble .
he comes forth like a flower , and is cut down . he also flees like a shadow , and doesn 't continue .
do you open your eyes on such a one , and bring me into judgment with you ?
who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? not one .
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months is with you , and you have appointed his bounds that he can 't pass ;
look away from him , that he may rest , until he shall accomplish , as a hireling , his day .
" for there is hope for a tree , If it is cut down , that it will sprout again , that the tender branch of it will not cease .
though its root grows old in the earth , and its stock dies in the ground ,
yet through the scent of water it will bud , and put forth boughs like a plant .
but man dies , and is laid low . yes , man gives up the spirit , and where is he ?
as the waters fail from the sea , and the river wastes and dries up ,
so man lies down and doesn 't rise . until the heavens are no more , they shall not awake , nor be roused out of their sleep .
" Oh that you would hide me in Sheol , that you would keep me secret , until your wrath is past , that you would appoint me a set time , and remember me !
if a man dies , shall he live again ? all the days of my warfare would I wait , until my release should come .
you would call , and I would answer you . you would have a desire to the work of your hands .
but now you number my steps . Don 't you watch over my sin ?
my disobedience is sealed up in a bag . you fasten up my iniquity .
" but the mountain falling comes to nothing . the rock is removed out of its place ;
the waters wear the stones . the torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth . so you destroy the hope of man .
you forever prevail against him , and he departs . you change his face , and send him away .
his sons come to honor , and he doesn 't know it . they are brought low , but he doesn 't perceive it of them .
but his flesh on him has pain , and his soul within him mourns . "
then Eliphaz the Temanite answered ,
" should a wise man answer with vain knowledge , and fill himself with the east wind ?
should he reason with unprofitable talk , or with speeches with which he can do no good ?
yes , you do away with fear , and hinder devotion before God .
for your iniquity teaches your mouth , and you choose the language of the crafty .
your own mouth condemns you , and not I. Yes , your own lips testify against you .
" are you the first man who was born ? or were you brought forth before the hills ?
have you heard the secret counsel of God ? do you limit wisdom to yourself ?
what do you know , that we don 't know ? what do you understand , which is not in us ?
with us are both the gray @-@ headed and the very aged men , much elder than your father .
are the consolations of God too small for you , even the word that is gentle toward you ?
why does your heart carry you away ? why do your eyes flash ,
that you turn your spirit against God , and let such words go out of your mouth ?
what is man , that he should be clean ? what is he who is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
behold , he puts no trust in his holy ones . yes , the heavens are not clean in his sight ;
how much less one who is abominable and corrupt , a man who drinks iniquity like water !
" I will show you , listen to me ; that which I have seen I will declare :
( which wise men have told by their fathers , and have not hidden it ;
to whom alone the land was given , and no stranger passed among them ) :
the wicked man writhes in pain all his days , even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor .
a sound of terrors is in his ears . in prosperity the destroyer shall come on him .
he doesn 't believe that he shall return out of darkness . he is waited for by the sword .
he wanders abroad for bread , saying , ' Where is it ? ' he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
distress and anguish make him afraid . they prevail against him , as a king ready to the battle .
because he has stretched out his hand against God , and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty ;
he runs at him with a stiff neck , with the thick shields of his bucklers ;
because he has covered his face with his fatness , and gathered fat on his thighs .
he has lived in desolate cities , in houses which no one inhabited , which were ready to become heaps .
he shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue , neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth .
he shall not depart out of darkness . the flame shall dry up his branches . by the breath of God 's mouth shall he go away .
let him not trust in emptiness , deceiving himself ; for emptiness shall be his reward .
it shall be accomplished before his time . his branch shall not be green .
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree .
for the company of the godless shall be barren , and fire shall consume the tents of bribery .
they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity . their heart prepares deceit . "
then Job answered ,
" I have heard many such things . you are all miserable comforters !
shall vain words have an end ? or what provokes you that you answer ?
I also could speak as you do . if your soul were in my soul 's place , I could join words together against you , and shake my head at you ,
but I would strengthen you with my mouth . the solace of my lips would relieve you .
" though I speak , my grief is not subsided . though I forbear , what am I eased ?
but now , God , you have surely worn me out . you have made desolate all my company .
you have shriveled me up . this is a witness against me . my leanness rises up against me . it testifies to my face .
he has torn me in his wrath , and persecuted me . he has gnashed on me with his teeth . my adversary sharpens his eyes on me .
they have gaped on me with their mouth . they have struck me on the cheek reproachfully . they gather themselves together against me .
God delivers me to the ungodly , and casts me into the hands of the wicked .
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the neck , and dashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .
his archers surround me . he splits my kidneys apart , and does not spare . he pours out my gall on the ground .
he breaks me with breach on breach . he runs on me like a giant .
I have sewed sackcloth on my skin , and have thrust my Horn in the dust .
my face is red with weeping . deep darkness is on my eyelids .
although there is no violence in my hands , and my prayer is pure .
" Earth , don 't cover my blood . let my cry have no place to rest .
even now , behold , my witness is in heaven . he who vouches for me is on high .
my friends scoff at me . my eyes pour out tears to God ,
that he would maintain the right of a man with God , of a son of man with his neighbor !
for when a few years have come , I shall go the way of no return .
" my spirit is consumed . my days are extinct , And the grave is ready for me .
surely there are mockers with me . my eye dwells on their provocation .
" now give a pledge , be collateral for me with yourself . who is there who will strike hands with me ?
for you have hidden their heart from understanding , Therefore you shall not exalt them .
he who Denounces his friends for a prey , Even the eyes of his children shall fail .
" but he has made me a byword of the people . they spit in my face .
my eye also is dim by reason of sorrow . all my members are as a shadow .
upright men shall be astonished at this . the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless .
yet shall the righteous hold on his way . he who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger .
but as for you all , come on now again ; I shall not find a wise man among you .
my days are past , my plans are broken off , as are the thoughts of my heart .
they change the night into day , saying ' The light is near ' in the presence of darkness .
if I look for Sheol as my house , if I have spread my couch in the darkness ,
if I have said to corruption , ' You are my father ; ' to the worm , ' My mother , ' and ' my sister ; '
where then is my hope ? as for my hope , who shall see it ?
shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol , or descend together into the dust ? "
then Bildad the Shuhite answered ,
" how long will you hunt for words ? consider , and afterwards we will speak .
why are we counted as animals , which have become unclean in your sight ?
you who tear yourself in your anger , shall the earth be forsaken for you ? or shall the rock be removed out of its place ?
" yes , the light of the wicked shall be put out , The spark of his fire shall not shine .
the light shall be dark in his tent . his lamp above him shall be put out .
the steps of his strength shall be shortened . his own counsel shall cast him down .
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he wanders into its mesh .
a snare will take him by the heel . a trap will catch him .
a noose is hidden for him in the ground , a trap for him in the way .
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side , and shall chase him at his heels .
his strength shall be famished . calamity shall be ready at his side .
the members of his body shall be devoured . the firstborn of death shall devour his members .
he shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts . he shall be brought to the king of terrors .
there shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his . sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation .
his roots shall be dried up beneath . above shall his branch be cut off .
his memory shall perish from the earth . he shall have no name in the street .
he shall be driven from light into darkness , and chased out of the world .
he shall have neither son nor grandson among his people , nor any remaining where he lived .
those who come after shall be astonished at his day , as those who went before were frightened .
surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous . this is the place of him who doesn 't know God . "
then Job answered ,
" how long will you torment me , and crush me with words ?
you have reproached me ten times . you aren 't ashamed that you attack me .
if it is true that I have erred , my error remains with myself .
if indeed you will magnify yourselves against me , and plead against me my reproach ;
know now that God has subverted me , and has surrounded me with his net .
" behold , I cry out of wrong , but I am not heard . I cry for help , but there is no justice .
he has walled up my way so that I can 't pass , and has set darkness in my paths .
he has stripped me of my glory , and taken the crown from my head .
he has broken me down on every side , and I am gone . my hope he has plucked up like a tree .
he has also kindled his wrath against me . he counts me among his adversaries .
his troops come on together , build a siege ramp against me , and encamp around my tent .
" he has put my brothers far from me . my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me .
my relatives have gone away . my familiar friends have forgotten me .
those who dwell in my house , and my maids , count me for a stranger . I am an alien in their sight .
I call to my servant , and he gives me no answer . I beg him with my mouth .
my breath is offensive to my wife . I am loathsome to the children of my own mother .
even young children despise me . if I arise , they speak against me .
all my familiar friends abhor me . they whom I loved have turned against me .
my bones stick to my skin and to my flesh . I have escaped by the skin of my teeth .
" have pity on me , have pity on me , you my friends ; for the hand of God has touched me .
why do you persecute me as God , and are not satisfied with my flesh ?
" Oh that my words were now written ! Oh that they were inscribed in a book !
that with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever !
but as for me , I know that my Redeemer lives . in the end , he will stand upon the earth .
after my skin is destroyed , then in my flesh shall I see God ,
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a stranger . " my heart is consumed within me .
if you say , ' How we will persecute him ! ' because the root of the matter is found in me ,
be afraid of the sword , for wrath brings the punishments of the sword , that you may know there is a judgment . "
then Zophar the Naamathite answered ,
" therefore do my thoughts give answer to me , even by reason of my haste that is in me .
I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame . the spirit of my understanding answers me .
Don 't you know this from old time , since man was placed on earth ,
that the triumphing of the wicked is short , the joy of the godless but for a moment ?
though his height mount up to the heavens , and his head reach to the clouds ,
yet he shall perish forever like his own Dung . those who have seen him shall say , ' Where is he ? '
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found . yes , he shall be chased away like a vision of the night .
the eye which saw him shall see him no more , neither shall his place any more see him .
his children shall seek the favor of the poor . his hands shall give back his wealth .
his bones are full of his youth , but youth shall lie down with him in the dust .
" though wickedness is sweet in his mouth , though he hide it under his tongue ,
though he spare it , and will not let it go , but keep it still within his mouth ;
yet his food in his bowels is turned . it is Cobra venom within him .
he has swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again . God will cast them out of his belly .
he shall suck Cobra venom . the viper 's tongue shall kill him .
he shall not look at the rivers , the flowing streams of honey and butter .
that for which he labored he shall restore , and shall not swallow it down . according to the substance that he has gotten , he shall not rejoice .
for he has oppressed and forsaken the poor . he has violently taken away a house , and he shall not build it up .
" because he knew no quietness within him , he shall not save anything of that in which he delights .
there was nothing left that he didn 't devour , therefore his prosperity shall not endure .
in the fullness of his sufficiency , distress shall overtake him . the hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him .
when he is about to fill his belly , God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him . it will rain on him while he is eating .
he shall flee from the iron weapon . the bronze arrow shall strike him through .
he draws it forth , and it comes out of his body . yes , the glittering point comes out of his liver . Terrors are on him .
all darkness is laid up for his treasures . an unfanned fire shall devour him . it shall consume that which is left in his tent .
the heavens shall reveal his iniquity . the earth shall rise up against him .
the increase of his house shall depart . they shall rush away in the day of his wrath .
this is the portion of a wicked man from God , the heritage appointed to him by God . "
then Job answered ,
" listen diligently to my speech . let this be your consolation .
allow me , and I also will speak ; After I have spoken , mock on .
as for me , is my complaint to man ? why shouldn 't I be impatient ?
look at me , and be astonished . lay your hand on your mouth .
when I remember , I am troubled . horror takes hold of my flesh .
" why do the wicked live , become old , yes , and grow mighty in power ?
their child is established with them in their sight , their offspring before their eyes .
their houses are safe from fear , neither is the rod of God upon them .
their bulls breed without fail . their cows calve , and don 't miscarry .
they send forth their little ones like a flock . their children dance .
they sing to the tambourine and harp , and rejoice at the sound of the pipe .
they spend their days in prosperity . in an instant they go down to Sheol .
they tell God , ' depart from us , for we don 't want to know about your ways .
what is the Almighty , that we should serve him ? what profit should we have , if we pray to him ? '
behold , their prosperity is not in their hand . the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
" how often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out , that their calamity comes on them , that God distributes sorrows in his anger ?
how often is it that they are as stubble before the wind , as chaff that the storm carries away ?
you say , ' God lays up his iniquity for his children . ' let him recompense it to himself , that he may know it .
let his own eyes see his destruction . let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty .
for what does he care for his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off ?
" shall any teach God knowledge , since he judges those who are high ?
one dies in his full strength , being wholly at ease and quiet .
his pails are full of milk . the marrow of his bones is moistened .
another dies in bitterness of soul , and never tastes of good .
they lie down alike in the dust . the worm covers them .
" behold , I know your thoughts , the devices with which you would wrong me .
for you say , ' Where is the house of the prince ? where is the tent in which the wicked lived ? '
haven 't you asked wayfaring men ? Don 't you know their evidences ,
that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity , That they are led forth to the day of wrath ?
who shall declare his way to his face ? who shall repay him what he has done ?
yet he will be borne to the grave . men shall keep watch over the tomb .
the clods of the valley shall be sweet to him . all men shall draw after him , as there were innumerable before him .
so how can you comfort me with nonsense , because in your answers there remains only falsehood ? "
then Eliphaz the Temanite answered ,
" can a man be profitable to God ? surely he who is wise is profitable to himself .
is it any pleasure to the Almighty , that you are righteous ? or does it benefit him , that you make your ways perfect ?
is it for your piety that he reproves you , that he enters with you into judgment ?
Isn 't your wickedness great ? neither is there any end to your iniquities .
for you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing , and stripped the naked of their clothing .
you haven 't given water to the weary to drink , and you have withheld bread from the hungry .
but as for the mighty man , he had the earth . the honorable man , he lived in it .
you have sent widows away empty , and the arms of the fatherless have been broken .
therefore snares are around you . sudden fear troubles you ,
or darkness , so that you can not see , and floods of waters cover you .
" Isn 't God in the heights of heaven ? see the height of the stars , how high they are !
you say , ' What does God know ? can he judge through the thick darkness ?
thick clouds are a covering to him , so that he doesn 't see . he walks on the vault of the sky . '
will you keep the old way , which wicked men have trodden ,
who were snatched away before their time , whose foundation was poured out as a stream ,
who said to God , ' depart from us ; ' and , ' What can the Almighty do for us ? '
yet he filled their houses with good things , but the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
the righteous see it , and are glad . the innocent ridicule them ,
saying , ' surely those who rose up against us are cut off . the fire has consumed their remnant . '
" acquaint yourself with him , now , and be at peace . thereby good shall come to you .
please receive instruction from his mouth , and lay up his words in your heart .
if you return to the Almighty , you shall be built up , if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents .
lay your treasure in the dust , the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks .
the Almighty will be your treasure , and precious silver to you .
for then you will delight yourself in the Almighty , and shall lift up your face to God .
you shall make your prayer to him , and he will hear you . you shall pay your vows .
you shall also decree a thing , and it shall be established to you . light shall shine on your ways .
when they cast down , you shall say , ' be lifted up . ' he will save the humble person .
he will even deliver him who is not innocent . yes , he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands . "
then Job answered ,
" even today my complaint is rebellious . his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning .
Oh that I knew where I might find him ! that I might come even to his seat !
I would set my cause in order before him , and fill my mouth with arguments .
I would know the words which he would answer me , and understand what he would tell me .
would he contend with me in the greatness of his power ? no , but he would listen to me .
there the upright might reason with him , so I should be delivered forever from my judge .
" if I go east , he is not there ; if west , I can 't find him ;
he works to the north , but I can 't see him . he turns south , but I can 't catch a glimpse of him .
but he knows the way that I take . when he has tried me , I shall come forth like gold .
my foot has held fast to his steps . I have kept his way , and not turned aside .
I haven 't gone back from the commandment of his lips . I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food .
but he stands alone , and who can oppose him ? what his soul desires , even that he does .
for he performs that which is appointed for me . many such things are with him .
therefore I am terrified at his presence . when I consider , I am afraid of him .
for God has made my heart faint . the Almighty has terrified me .
because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face .
" why aren 't times laid up by the Almighty ? why don 't those who know him see his days ?
there are people who remove the landmarks . they violently take away flocks , and feed them .
they drive away the donkey of the fatherless , and they take the widow 's ox for a pledge .
they turn the needy out of the way . the poor of the earth all hide themselves .
behold , as wild donkeys in the desert , they go forth to their work , seeking diligently for food . the wilderness yields them bread for their children .
they cut their provender in the field . they glean the vineyard of the wicked .
they lie all night naked without clothing , and have no covering in the cold .
they are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter .
there are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge of the poor ,
so that they go around naked without clothing . being hungry , they carry the sheaves .
they make oil within the walls of these men . they tread wine presses , and suffer thirst .
from out of the populous city , men groan . the soul of the wounded cries out , yet God doesn 't regard the Folly .
" these are of those who rebel against the light . they don 't know its ways , nor stay in its paths .
the murderer rises with the light . he kills the poor and needy . in the night he is like a thief .
the eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight , saying , ' No eye shall see me . ' he disguises his face .
in the dark they dig through houses . they shut themselves up in the daytime . they don 't know the light .
for the morning is to all of them like thick darkness , for they know the terrors of the thick darkness .
" they are foam on the surface of the waters . their portion is Cursed in the earth . they don 't turn into the way of the vineyards .
drought and heat consume the snow waters , so does Sheol those who have sinned .
the womb shall forget him . the worm shall feed sweetly on him . he shall be no more remembered . Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree .
he devours the barren who don 't bear . he shows no kindness to the widow .
yet God preserves the mighty by his power . he rises up who has no assurance of life .
God gives them security , and they rest in it . his eyes are on their ways .
they are exalted ; yet a little while , and they are gone . yes , they are brought low , they are taken out of the way as all others , and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain .
if it isn 't so now , who will prove me a liar , and make my speech worth nothing ? "
then Bildad the Shuhite answered ,
" Dominion and fear are with him . he makes peace in his high places .
can his armies be counted ? on whom does his light not arise ?
how then can man be just with God ? or how can he who is born of a woman be clean ?
behold , even the moon has no brightness , and the stars are not pure in his sight ;
how much less man , who is a worm , the son of man , who is a worm ! "
then Job answered ,
" how have you helped him who is without power ! how have you saved the arm that has no strength !
how have you counseled him who has no wisdom , and plentifully declared sound knowledge !
to whom have you uttered words ? whose spirit came forth from you ?
" those who are deceased tremble , those beneath the waters and all that live in them .
Sheol is naked before God , and Abaddon has no covering .
he stretches out the north over empty space , and hangs the earth on nothing .
he binds up the waters in his thick clouds , and the cloud is not burst under them .
he encloses the face of his throne , and spreads his cloud on it .
he has described a boundary on the surface of the waters , and to the confines of light and darkness .
the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke .
he stirs up the sea with his power , and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab .
by his Spirit the heavens are garnished . his hand has pierced the swift serpent .
behold , these are but the outskirts of his ways . how small a whisper do we hear of him ! but the Thunder of his power who can understand ? "
job again took up his parable , and said ,
" as God lives , who has taken away my right , the Almighty , who has made my soul bitter .
( for the length of my life is still in me , and the spirit of God is in my nostrils ) ;
surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness , neither shall my tongue utter deceit .
far be it from me that I should justify you . until I die I will not put away my integrity from me .
I hold fast to my righteousness , and will not let it go . my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live .
" let my enemy be as the wicked . let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous .
for what is the hope of the godless , when he is cut off , when God takes away his life ?
will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him ?
will he delight himself in the Almighty , and call on God at all times ?
I will teach you about the hand of God . that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal .
behold , all of you have seen it yourselves ; why then have you become altogether vain ?
" this is the portion of a wicked man with God , the heritage of oppressors , which they receive from the Almighty .
if his children are multiplied , it is for the sword . his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread .
those who remain of him shall be buried in death . his widows shall make no lamentation .
though he heap up silver as the dust , and prepare clothing as the clay ;
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
he builds his house as the moth , as a booth which the watchman makes .
he lies down rich , but he shall not do so again . he opens his eyes , and he is not .
Terrors overtake him like waters . a storm steals him away in the night .
the east wind carries him away , and he departs . it sweeps him out of his place .
for it hurls at him , and does not spare , as he flees away from his hand .
men shall clap their hands at him , and shall hiss him out of his place .
" surely there is a mine for silver , and a place for gold which they refine .
iron is taken out of the earth , and copper is smelted out of the ore .
man sets an end to darkness , and searches out , to the furthest bound , the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness .
he breaks open a Shaft away from where people live . they are forgotten by the foot . they hang far from men , they swing back and forth .
as for the earth , out of it comes bread ; underneath it is turned up as it were by fire .
Sapphires come from its rocks . it has dust of gold .
that path no bird of prey knows , neither has the falcon 's eye seen it .
the proud animals have not trodden it , nor has the fierce lion passed by there .
he puts forth his hand on the flinty rock , and he overturns the mountains by the roots .
he cuts out channels among the rocks . his eye sees every precious thing .
he binds the streams that they don 't trickle . the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light .
" but where shall wisdom be found ? where is the place of understanding ?
man doesn 't know its price ; Neither is it found in the land of the living .
it can 't be gotten for gold , neither shall silver be weighed for its price .
it can 't be valued with the gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire .
gold and glass can 't equal it , neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold .
no mention shall be made of coral or of crystal . yes , the price of wisdom is above rubies .
the topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it , Neither shall it be valued with pure gold .
where then does wisdom come from ? where is the place of understanding ?
seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living , and kept close from the birds of the sky .
destruction and Death say , ' We have heard a rumor of it with our ears . '
" God understands its way , and he knows its place .
for he looks to the ends of the earth , and sees under the whole sky .
he establishes the force of the wind . yes , he measures out the waters by measure .
when he made a decree for the rain , and a way for the lightning of the Thunder ;
then he saw it , and declared it . he established it , yes , and searched it out .
to man he said , ' behold , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom . to depart from evil is understanding . ' "
job again took up his parable , and said ,
" Oh that I were as in the months of old , as in the days when God watched over me ;
when his lamp shone on my head , and by his light I walked through darkness ,
as I was in the ripeness of my days , when the friendship of God was in my tent ,
when the Almighty was yet with me , and my children were around me ,
when my steps were washed with butter , and the rock poured out streams of oil for me ,
when I went forth to the city gate , when I prepared my seat in the street .
the young men saw me and hid themselves . the aged rose up and stood .
the princes refrained from talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
the voice of the nobles was hushed , and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth .
for when the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw me , it commended me :
because I delivered the poor who cried , and the fatherless also , who had none to help him ,
the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me , and I caused the widow 's heart to sing for joy .
I put on righteousness , and it clothed me . my justice was as a robe and a diadem .
I was eyes to the blind , and feet to the lame .
I was a father to the needy . the cause of him who I didn 't know , I searched out .
I broke the jaws of the unrighteous , and plucked the prey out of his teeth .
then I said , ' I shall die in my own house , I shall number my days as the sand .
my root is spread out to the waters . the dew lies all night on my branch .
my glory is fresh in me . my bow is renewed in my hand . '
" men listened to me , waited , and kept silence for my counsel .
after my words they didn 't speak again . my speech fell on them .
they waited for me as for the rain . their mouths drank as with the spring rain .
I smiled on them when they had no confidence . they didn 't reject the light of my face .
I chose out their way , and sat as chief . I lived as a king in the army , as one who comforts the mourners .
" but now those who are younger than I have me in derision , whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs .
of what use is the strength of their hands to me , men in whom ripe age has perished ?
they are gaunt from lack and famine . they gnaw the dry ground , in the gloom of waste and desolation .
they pluck salt herbs by the bushes . the roots of the Broom are their food .
they are driven out from the midst of men . they cry after them as after a thief ;
so that they dwell in frightful valleys , and in holes of the earth and of the rocks .
among the bushes they bray ; and under the nettles they are gathered together .
they are children of fools , yes , children of base men . they were flogged out of the land .
" now I have become their song . yes , I am a byword to them .
they abhor me , they stand aloof from me , and don 't hesitate to spit in my face .
for he has untied his cord , and afflicted me ; and they have thrown off restraint before me .
on my right hand rise the rabble . they thrust aside my feet , They cast up against me their ways of destruction .
they mar my path , They set forward my calamity , without anyone 's help .
as through a wide breach they come , in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in .
Terrors have turned on me . they chase my honor as the wind . my welfare has passed away as a cloud .
" now my soul is poured out within me . days of affliction have taken hold on me .
in the night season my bones are pierced in me , and the pains that gnaw me take no rest .
by great force is my garment disfigured . it binds me about as the collar of my coat .
he has cast me into the mire . I have become like dust and ashes .
I cry to you , and you do not answer me . I stand up , and you gaze at me .
you have turned to be cruel to me . with the might of your hand you persecute me .
you lift me up to the wind , and drive me with it . you dissolve me in the storm .
for I know that you will bring me to death , To the house appointed for all living .
" however doesn 't one stretch out a hand in his fall ? or in his calamity therefore cry for help ?
Didn 't I weep for him who was in trouble ? Wasn 't my soul grieved for the needy ?
when I looked for good , then evil came ; When I waited for light , there came darkness .
my heart is troubled , and doesn 't rest . days of affliction have come on me .
I go mourning without the sun . I stand up in the assembly , and cry for help .
I am a brother to jackals , and a companion to ostriches .
my skin grows black and peels from me . my bones are burned with heat .
therefore my harp has turned to mourning , and my pipe into the voice of those who weep .
" I made a Covenant with my eyes , how then should I look lustfully at a young woman ?
for what is the portion from God above , and the heritage from the Almighty on high ?
is it not calamity to the unrighteous , and disaster to the workers of iniquity ?
Doesn 't he see my ways , and number all my steps ?
" if I have walked with falsehood , and my foot has hurried to deceit
( let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may know my integrity ) ;
if my step has turned out of the way , if my heart walked after my eyes , if any defilement has stuck to my hands ,
then let me sow , and let another eat . yes , let the produce of my field be rooted out .
" if my heart has been enticed to a woman , and I have laid wait at my neighbor 's door ,
then let my wife grind for another , and let others sleep with her .
for that would be a heinous crime . yes , it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges :
for it is a fire that consumes to destruction , and would root out all my increase .
" if I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant , when they contended with me ;
what then shall I do when God rises up ? when he visits , what shall I answer him ?
Didn 't he who made me in the womb make him ? Didn 't one fashion us in the womb ?
" if I have withheld the poor from their desire , or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail ,
or have eaten my morsel alone , and the fatherless has not eaten of it
( no , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , her have I guided from my mother 's womb ) ;
if I have seen any perish for want of clothing , or that the needy had no covering ;
if his heart hasn 't blessed me , if he hasn 't been warmed with my sheep 's Fleece ;
if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless , because I saw my help in the gate ,
then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade , and my arm be broken from the bone .
for calamity from God is a terror to me . because his majesty , I can do nothing .
" if I have made gold my hope , and have said to the fine gold , ' You are my confidence ; '
if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great , and because my hand had gotten much ;
if I have seen the sun when it shined , or the moon moving in splendor ,
and my heart has been secretly enticed , and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth ,
this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges ; for I should have denied the God who is above .
" if I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him ;
( yes , I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse ) ;
if the men of my tent have not said , ' Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat ? '
( the foreigner has not lodged in the street , but I have opened my doors to the Traveler ) ;
if like Adam I have covered my transgressions , by hiding my iniquity in my heart ,
Oh that I had one to hear me ! ( behold , here is my signature , let the Almighty answer me ) ; let the accuser write my indictment !
surely I would carry it on my shoulder ; and I would bind it to me as a crown .
I would declare to him the number of my steps. as a prince would I go near to him .
if my land cries out against me , and its furrows weep together ;
if I have eaten its fruits without money , or have caused its owners to lose their life ,
let briars grow instead of wheat , and stinkweed instead of barley . " the words of Job are ended .
so these three men ceased to answer Job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel , the Buzite , of the family of Ram , was kindled against Job . his wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God .
also his wrath was kindled against his three friends , because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned Job .
now Elihu had waited to speak to Job , because they were elder than he .
when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men , his wrath was kindled .
Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered , " I am young , and you are very old ; Therefore I held back , and didn 't dare show you my opinion .
I said , ' Days should speak , and multitude of years should teach wisdom . '
but there is a spirit in man , and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding .
it is not the great who are wise , nor the aged who understand justice .
therefore I said , ' listen to me ; I also will show my opinion . '
" behold , I waited for your words , and I listened for your reasoning , while you searched out what to say .
yes , I gave you my full attention , but there was no one who convinced Job , or who answered his words , among you .
beware lest you say , ' We have found wisdom , God may refute him , not man ; '
for he has not directed his words against me ; neither will I answer him with your speeches .
" they are amazed . they answer no more . they don 't have a word to say .
shall I wait , because they don 't speak , because they stand still , and answer no more ?
I also will answer my part , and I also will show my opinion .
for I am full of words . the spirit within me constrains me .
behold , my breast is as wine which has no vent ; like new wineskins it is ready to burst .
I will speak , that I may be refreshed . I will open my lips and answer .
please don 't let me respect any man 's person , neither will I give flattering titles to any man .
for I don 't know how to give flattering titles ; or else my Maker would soon take me away .
" however , Job , please hear my speech , and listen to all my words .
see now , I have opened my mouth . my tongue has spoken in my mouth .
my words shall utter the uprightness of my heart . that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely .
the Spirit of God has made me , and the breath of the Almighty gives me life .
if you can , answer me . set your words in order before me , and stand forth .
behold , I am toward God even as you are . I am also formed out of the clay .
behold , my terror shall not make you afraid , neither shall my pressure be heavy on you .
" surely you have spoken in my hearing , I have heard the voice of your words , saying ,
'i am clean , without disobedience . I am innocent , neither is there iniquity in me .
behold , he finds occasions against me . he counts me for his enemy .
he puts my feet in the stocks . he marks all my paths . '
" behold , I will answer you . in this you are not just , for God is greater than man .
why do you strive against him , because he doesn 't give account of any of his matters ?
for God speaks once , yes twice , though man pays no attention .
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falls on men , in slumbering on the bed ;
then he opens the ears of men , and seals their instruction ,
that he may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man .
he keeps back his soul from the pit , and his life from perishing by the sword .
he is chastened also with pain on his bed , with continual strife in his bones ;
so that his life abhors bread , and his soul dainty food .
his flesh is so consumed away , that it can 't be seen . his bones that were not seen stick out .
yes , his soul draws near to the pit , and his life to the destroyers .
" if there is beside him an angel , an interpreter , one among a thousand , to show to man what is right for him ;
then God is gracious to him , and says , ' Deliver him from going down to the pit , I have found a ransom . '
his flesh shall be fresher than a child 's . he returns to the days of his youth .
he prays to God , and he is favorable to him , so that he sees his face with joy . he restores to man his righteousness .
he sings before men , and says , ' I have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it didn 't profit me .
he has redeemed my soul from going into the pit . my life shall see the light . '
" behold , God works all these things , twice , yes three times , with a man ,
mark well , Job , and listen to me . hold your peace , and I will speak .
if you have anything to say , answer me . speak , for I desire to justify you .
if not , listen to me . hold your peace , and I will teach you wisdom . "
moreover Elihu answered ,
" hear my words , you wise men . give ear to me , you who have knowledge .
for the ear tries words , as the palate tastes food .
let us choose for us that which is right . let us know among ourselves what is good .
for Job has said , ' I am righteous , God has taken away my right :
notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar . my wound is incurable , though I am without disobedience . '
what man is like Job , who drinks scorn like water ,
who goes in company with the workers of iniquity , and walks with wicked men ?
for he has said , ' It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God . '
" therefore listen to me , you men of understanding : far be it from God , that he should do wickedness , from the Almighty , that he should commit iniquity .
for the work of a man he will render to him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
yes surely , God will not do wickedly , neither will the Almighty pervert justice .
who put him in charge of the earth ? or who has appointed him over the whole world ?
if he set his heart on himself , If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath ,
all flesh would perish together , and man would turn again to dust .
" if now you have understanding , hear this . listen to the voice of my words .
shall even one who hates justice govern ? will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty ? --
who says to a king , ' Vile ! ' or to nobles , ' Wicked ! ' ?
who doesn 't respect the persons of princes , nor respects the rich more than the poor ; for they all are the work of his hands .
in a moment they die , even at midnight . the people are shaken and pass away . the mighty are taken away without a hand .
" for his eyes are on the ways of a man . he sees all his goings .
there is no darkness , nor thick gloom , where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves .
for he doesn 't need to consider a man further , that he should go before God in judgment .
he breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out , and sets others in their place .
therefore he takes knowledge of their works . he overturns them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
he strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others ;
because they turned aside from following him , and wouldn 't pay attention to any of his ways ,
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him . he heard the cry of the afflicted .
when he gives quietness , who then can condemn ? when he hides his face , who then can see him ? alike whether to a nation , or to a man ,
that the godless man may not reign , that there be no one to ensnare the people .
" for has any said to God , ' I am guilty , but I will not offend any more .
teach me that which I don 't see . if I have done iniquity , I will do it no more ' ?
shall his recompense be as you desire , that you refuse it ? for you must choose , and not I. Therefore speak what you know .
men of understanding will tell me , yes , every wise man who hears me :
'Job speaks without knowledge . his words are without wisdom . '
I wish that Job were tried to the end , because of his answering like wicked men .
for he adds rebellion to his sin . he claps his hands among us , and multiplies his words against God . "
moreover Elihu answered ,
" do you think this to be your right , or do you say , ' My righteousness is more than God 's , '
that you ask , ' What advantage will it be to you ? what profit shall I have , more than if I had sinned ? '
I will answer you , and your companions with you .
look to the heavens , and see . see the skies , which are higher than you .
if you have sinned , what effect do you have against him ? if your transgressions are multiplied , what do you do to him ?
if you are righteous , what do you give him ? or what does he receive from your hand ?
your wickedness may hurt a man as you are , and your righteousness may profit a son of man .
" by reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out . they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty .
but none says , ' Where is God my Maker , who gives songs in the night ,
who teaches us more than the animals of the earth , and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky ? '
there they cry , but none gives answer , because of the pride of evil men .
surely God will not hear an empty cry , neither will the Almighty regard it .
how much less when you say you don 't see him . the cause is before him , and you wait for him !
but now , because he has not visited in his anger , neither does he greatly regard arrogance .
therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk , and he multiplies words without knowledge . "
Elihu also continued , and said ,
" bear with me a little , and I will show you ; for I still have something to say on God 's behalf .
I will get my knowledge from afar , and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker .
for truly my words are not false . one who is perfect in knowledge is with you .
" behold , God is mighty , and doesn 't despise anyone . he is mighty in strength of understanding .
he doesn 't preserve the life of the wicked , but gives to the afflicted their right .
he doesn 't withdraw his eyes from the righteous , but with kings on the throne , he sets them forever , and they are exalted .
if they are bound in fetters , and are taken in the cords of afflictions ,
then he shows them their work , and their transgressions , that they have behaved themselves proudly .
he also opens their ears to instruction , and commands that they return from iniquity .
if they listen and serve him , they shall spend their days in prosperity , and their years in pleasures .
but if they don 't listen , they shall perish by the sword ; they shall die without knowledge .
" but those who are godless in heart lay up anger . they don 't cry for help when he binds them .
they die in youth . their life perishes among the unclean .
he delivers the afflicted by their affliction , and opens their ear in oppression .
yes , he would have allured you out of distress , into a broad place , where there is no restriction . that which is set on your table would be full of fatness .
" but you are full of the judgment of the wicked . judgment and justice take hold of you .
Don 't let riches entice you to wrath , neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside .
would your wealth sustain you in distress , or all the might of your strength ?
Don 't desire the night , when people are cut off in their place .
take heed , don 't regard iniquity ; for you have chosen this rather than affliction .
behold , God is exalted in his power . who is a teacher like him ?
who has prescribed his way for him ? or who can say , ' You have committed unrighteousness ? '
" remember that you magnify his work , whereof men have sung .
all men have looked thereon . man sees it afar off .
behold , God is great , and we don 't know him . the number of his years is unsearchable .
for he draws up the drops of water , which distill in rain from his vapor ,
which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly .
yes , can any understand the spreading of the clouds , and the thunderings of his pavilion ?
behold , he spreads his light around him . he covers the bottom of the sea .
for by these he judges the people . he gives food in abundance .
he covers his hands with the lightning , and commands it to strike the mark .
its noise tells about him , and the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up .
" yes , at this my heart trembles , and is moved out of its place .
hear , oh , hear the noise of his voice , the sound that goes out of his mouth .
he sends it forth under the whole sky , and his lightning to the ends of the earth .
after it a voice roars . he thunders with the voice of his majesty . he doesn 't hold back anything when his voice is heard .
God thunders marvelously with his voice . he does great things , which we can 't comprehend .
for he says to the snow , ' Fall on the earth ; ' likewise to the shower of rain , and to the showers of his mighty rain .
he seals up the hand of every man , that all men whom he has made may know it .
then the animals take cover , and remain in their dens .
out of its room comes the storm , and cold out of the north .
by the breath of God , ice is given , and the breadth of the waters is frozen .
yes , he loads the thick cloud with moisture . he spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning .
it is turned around by his guidance , that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world ,
whether it is for correction , or for his land , or for loving kindness , that he causes it to come .
" listen to this , Job . stand still , and consider the wondrous works of God .
do you know how God controls them , and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine ?
do you know the workings of the clouds , the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge ?
you whose clothing is warm , when the earth is still by reason of the south wind ?
can you , with him , spread out the sky , which is strong as a cast metal mirror ?
teach us what we shall tell him , for we can 't make our case by reason of darkness .
shall it be told him that I would speak ? or should a man wish that he were swallowed up ?
now men don 't see the light which is bright in the skies , but the wind passes , and clears them .
out of the north comes golden splendor . with God is awesome majesty .
we can 't reach the Almighty . he is exalted in power . in justice and great righteousness , he will not oppress .
therefore men revere him . he doesn 't regard any who are wise of heart . "
then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind ,
" who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge ?
Brace yourself like a man , for I will question you , then you answer me !
" where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth ? declare , if you have understanding .
who determined its measures , if you know ? or who stretched the line on it ?
Whereupon were its foundations fastened ? or who laid its cornerstone ,
when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ?
" or who shut up the sea with doors , when it broke forth from the womb ,
when I made clouds its garment , and wrapped it in thick darkness ,
marked out for it my bound , set bars and doors ,
and said , ' Here you may come , but no further . here your proud waves shall be stayed ? '
" have you commanded the morning in your days , and caused the dawn to know its place ;
that it might take hold of the ends of the earth , and shake the wicked out of it ?
it is changed as clay under the seal , and stands forth as a garment .
from the wicked , their light is withheld . the high arm is broken .
" have you entered into the springs of the sea ? or have you walked in the recesses of the deep ?
have the gates of death been revealed to you ? or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death ?
have you comprehended the earth in its breadth ? declare , if you know it all .
" what is the way to the dwelling of light ? as for darkness , where is its place ,
that you should take it to its bound , that you should discern the paths to its house ?
surely you know , for you were born then , and the number of your days is great !
which I have reserved against the time of trouble , against the day of battle and war ?
by what way is the lightning distributed , or the east wind scattered on the earth ?
who has cut a channel for the flood water , or the path for the thunderstorm ;
to cause it to rain on a land where no man is ; on the wilderness , in which there is no man ;
to satisfy the waste and desolate ground , to cause the tender grass to spring forth ?
does the rain have a father ? or who fathers the drops of dew ?
out of whose womb came the ice ? the gray Frost of the sky , who has given birth to it ?
the waters become hard like stone , when the surface of the deep is frozen .
" can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades , or loosen the cords of Orion ?
can you lead forth the constellations in their season ? or can you guide the Bear with her cubs ?
do you know the laws of the heavens ? can you establish its dominion over the earth ?
" can you lift up your voice to the clouds , That abundance of waters may cover you ?
can you send forth lightnings , that they may go ? do they report to you , ' Here we are ? '
who has put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who has given understanding to the mind ?
who can number the clouds by wisdom ? or who can pour out the bottles of the sky ,
when the dust runs into a mass , and the clods of earth stick together ?
" can you hunt the prey for the lioness , or satisfy the appetite of the young lions ,
when they crouch in their dens , and lie in wait in the thicket ?
who provides for the raven his prey , when his young ones cry to God , and wander for lack of food ?
" do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth ? do you watch when the doe bears fawns ?
can you number the months that they fulfill ? or do you know the time when they give birth ?
they bow themselves , they bring forth their young , they end their labor pains .
their young ones become strong . they grow up in the open field . they go forth , and don 't return again .
" who has set the wild donkey free ? or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey ,
whose home I have made the wilderness , and the salt land his dwelling place ?
he scorns the tumult of the city , neither does he hear the shouting of the driver .
the range of the mountains is his pasture , He searches after every green thing .
" will the wild ox be content to serve you ? or will he stay by your feeding trough ?
can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness ? or will he till the valleys after you ?
will you trust him , because his strength is great ? or will you leave to him your labor ?
will you confide in him , that he will bring home your seed , and gather the grain of your threshing floor ?
" the wings of the ostrich wave proudly ; but are they the feathers and plumage of love ?
for she leaves her eggs on the earth , warms them in the dust ,
and forgets that the foot may crush them , or that the wild animal may trample them .
she deals harshly with her young ones , as if they were not hers . though her labor is in vain , she is without fear ,
because God has deprived her of wisdom , neither has he imparted to her understanding .
when she lifts up herself on high , she scorns the horse and his Rider .
" have you given the horse might ? have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane ?
have you made him to leap as a locust ? the glory of his snorting is awesome .
he paws in the valley , and rejoices in his strength . he goes out to meet the armed men .
he mocks at fear , and is not dismayed , neither does he turn back from the sword .
the quiver rattles against him , the flashing spear and the javelin .
he eats up the ground with fierceness and rage , neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet .
as often as the trumpet sounds he snorts , ' Aha ! ' he smells the battle afar off , the Thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
" is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars , and stretches her wings toward the south ?
is it at your command that the eagle mounts up , and makes his nest on high ?
on the cliff he dwells , and makes his home , on the point of the cliff , and the stronghold .
from there he spies out the prey . his eyes see it afar off .
his young ones also suck up blood . where the slain are , there he is . "
moreover Yahweh answered Job ,
" shall he who argues contend with the Almighty ? he who argues with God , let him answer it . "
then Job answered Yahweh ,
" behold , I am of small account . what shall I answer you ? I lay my hand on my mouth .
I have spoken once , and I will not answer ; Yes , twice , but I will proceed no further . "
then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind ,
" now brace yourself like a man . I will question you , and you will answer me .
will you even annul my judgment ? will you condemn me , that you may be justified ?
or do you have an arm like God ? can you Thunder with a voice like him ?
" now deck yourself with excellency and dignity . array yourself with honor and majesty .
pour out the fury of your anger . look at everyone who is proud , and bring him low .
look at everyone who is proud , and humble him . crush the wicked in their place .
hide them in the dust together . bind their faces in the hidden place .
then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you .
" see now , behemoth , which I made as well as you . he eats grass as an ox .
look now , his strength is in his thighs . his force is in the muscles of his belly .
he moves his tail like a cedar . the sinews of his thighs are knit together .
his bones are like tubes of brass . his limbs are like bars of iron .
he is the chief of the ways of God . he who made him gives him his sword .
surely the mountains produce food for him , where all the animals of the field play .
he lies under the lotus trees , in the covert of the Reed , and the marsh .
the lotuses cover him with their shade . the willows of the Brook surround him .
behold , if a river overflows , he doesn 't tremble . he is confident , though the Jordan swells even to his mouth .
shall any take him when he is on the watch , or Pierce through his nose with a snare ?
" can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook , or press down his tongue with a cord ?
can you put a rope into his nose , or Pierce his jaw through with a hook ?
will he make many petitions to you , or will he speak soft words to you ?
will he make a Covenant with you , that you should take him for a servant forever ?
will you play with him as with a bird ? or will you bind him for your girls ?
will traders barter for him ? will they part him among the merchants ?
can you fill his skin with barbed irons , or his head with fish spears ?
lay your hand on him . remember the battle , and do so no more .
behold , the hope of him is in vain . won 't one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
none is so fierce that he dare stir him up . who then is he who can stand before me ?
who has first given to me , that I should repay him ? everything under the heavens is mine .
" I will not keep silence concerning his limbs , nor his mighty strength , nor his goodly frame .
who can open the doors of his face ? around his teeth is terror .
strong scales are his pride , shut up together with a close seal .
one is so near to another , that no air can come between them .
they are joined one to another . they stick together , so that they can 't be pulled apart .
his sneezing flashes out light . his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning .
out of his mouth go burning torches . sparks of fire leap forth .
out of his nostrils a smoke goes , as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds .
his breath kindles coals . a flame goes forth from his mouth .
there is strength in his neck . terror dances before him .
the flakes of his flesh are joined together . they are firm on him . they can 't be moved .
his heart is as firm as a stone , yes , firm as the lower millstone .
when he raises himself up , the mighty are afraid . they retreat before his thrashing .
if one attacks him with the sword , it can 't prevail ; nor the spear , the dart , nor the pointed Shaft .
he counts iron as straw ; and brass as rotten wood .
the arrow can 't make him flee . Sling stones are like chaff to him .
clubs are counted as stubble . he laughs at the rushing of the javelin .
his undersides are like sharp potsherds , leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge .
he makes the deep to boil like a pot . he makes the sea like a pot of ointment .
he makes a path shine after him . one would think the deep had white hair .
on earth there is not his equal , that is made without fear .
he sees everything that is high . he is king over all the sons of pride . "
then Job answered Yahweh ,
" I know that you can do all things , and that no purpose of yours can be restrained .
you asked , ' Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge ? ' therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand , things too wonderful for me , which I didn 't know .
you said , ' listen , now , and I will speak ; I will question you , and you will answer me . '
I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear , but now my eye sees you .
therefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes . "
it was so , that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job , Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite , " My wrath is kindled against you , and against your two friends ; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant Job has .
so Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went , and did what Yahweh commanded them , and Yahweh accepted Job .
Yahweh turned the captivity of Job , when he prayed for his friends . Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before .
so Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning . he had fourteen thousand sheep , six thousand camels , one thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand female donkeys .
he had also seven sons and three daughters .
after this Job lived one hundred forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , to four generations .
so Job died , being old and full of days .
blessed is the man who doesn 't walk in the counsel of the wicked , nor stand in the way of sinners , nor sit in the seat of scoffers ;
but his delight is in Yahweh 's law . on his law he meditates day and night .
he will be like a tree planted by the streams of water , that brings forth its fruit in its season , whose leaf also does not wither . whatever he does shall prosper .
the wicked are not so , but are like the chaff which the wind drives away .
therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment , nor sinners in the Congregation of the righteous .
for Yahweh knows the way of the righteous , but the way of the wicked shall perish .
why do the nations rage , and the peoples plot a vain thing ?
the kings of the earth take a stand , and the rulers take counsel together , against Yahweh , and against his Anointed , saying ,
" let 's break their bonds apart , and cast their cords from us . "
he who sits in the heavens will laugh . the Lord will have them in derision .
then he will speak to them in his anger , and terrify them in his wrath :
" yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion . "
I will tell of the decree . Yahweh said to me , " You are my son . today I have become your father .
ask of me , and I will give the nations for your inheritance , the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession .
you shall break them with a rod of iron . you shall dash them in pieces like a Potter 's vessel . "
now therefore be wise , you kings . be instructed , you judges of the earth .
give sincere Homage to the Son , lest he be angry , and you perish in the way , for his wrath will soon be kindled . blessed are all those who take refuge in him .
< < A Psalm by David , when he fled from Absalom his son . > > Yahweh , how my adversaries have increased ! many are those who rise up against me .
many there are who say of my soul , " There is no help for him in God . " Selah .
but you , Yahweh , are a shield around me , my glory , and the one who lifts up my head .
I cry to Yahweh with my voice , and he answers me out of his holy hill . Selah .
I laid myself down and slept . I awakened ; for Yahweh sustains me .
I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side .
arise , Yahweh ! save me , my God ! for you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone . you have broken the teeth of the wicked .
salvation belongs to Yahweh . your blessing be on your people . Selah .
< < For the Chief Musician ; on stringed instruments . a Psalm by David . > > answer me when I call , God of my righteousness . give me relief from my distress . have mercy on me , and hear my prayer .
you sons of men , how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor ? will you love vanity , and seek after falsehood ? Selah .
but know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly : Yahweh will hear when I call to him .
stand in awe , and don 't sin . search your own heart on your bed , and be still . Selah .
offer the sacrifices of righteousness . put your trust in Yahweh .
many say , " Who will show us any good ? " Yahweh , let the light of your face shine on us .
you have put gladness in my heart , more than when their grain and their new wine are increased .
in peace I will both lay myself down and sleep , for you , Yahweh alone , make me live in safety .
< < For the Chief Musician , with the flutes . a Psalm by David . > > Give ear to my words , Yahweh . consider my meditation .
listen to the voice of my cry , my King and my God ; for to you do I pray .
Yahweh , in the morning you shall hear my voice . in the morning I will lay my requests before you , and will watch expectantly .
for you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness . evil can 't live with you .
the arrogant shall not stand in your sight . you hate all workers of iniquity .
you will destroy those who speak lies . Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man .
but as for me , in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house . I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you .
lead me , Yahweh , in your righteousness because of my enemies . make your way straight before my face .
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth . their heart is destruction . their throat is an open tomb . they flatter with their tongue .
hold them guilty , God . let them fall by their own counsels ; thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions , for they have rebelled against you .
but let all those who take refuge in you rejoice , Let them always shout for joy , because you defend them . let them also who love your name be joyful in you .
for you will bless the righteous . Yahweh , you will surround him with favor as with a shield .
< < For the Chief Musician ; on stringed instruments , upon the eight @-@ stringed Lyre . a Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , don 't rebuke me in your anger , neither discipline me in your wrath .
have mercy on me , Yahweh , for I am faint . Yahweh , heal me , for my bones are troubled .
my soul is also in great anguish . but you , Yahweh--how long ?
return , Yahweh . deliver my soul , and save me for your loving kindness ' sake .
for in death there is no memory of you . in Sheol , who shall give you thanks ?
I am weary with my groaning . every night I flood my bed . I drench my couch with my tears .
my eye wastes away because of grief . it grows old because of all my adversaries .
depart from me , all you workers of iniquity , for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping .
Yahweh has heard my supplication . Yahweh accepts my prayer .
May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed . they shall turn back , they shall be disgraced suddenly .
< < A meditation by David , which he sang to Yahweh , concerning the words of Cush , the Benjamite . > > Yahweh , my God , I take refuge in you . save me from all those who pursue me , and deliver me ,
lest they tear apart my soul like a lion , ripping it in pieces , while there is none to deliver .
Yahweh , my God , if I have done this , if there is iniquity in my hands ,
if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me ( yes , if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary ) ,
let the enemy pursue my soul , and overtake it ; yes , let him tread my life down to the earth , and lay my glory in the dust . Selah .
arise , Yahweh , in your anger . lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries . awake for me . you have commanded judgment .
let the Congregation of the peoples surround you . rule over them on high .
Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples . judge me , Yahweh , according to my righteousness , and to my integrity that is in me .
Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end , but establish the righteous ; their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God .
my shield is with God , who saves the upright in heart .
God is a righteous judge , yes , a God who has indignation every day .
if a man doesn 't relent , he will sharpen his sword ; he has bent and strung his bow .
he has also prepared for himself the instruments of death . he makes ready his flaming arrows .
behold , he travails with iniquity . yes , he has conceived mischief , and brought forth falsehood .
he has dug a hole , and has fallen into the pit which he made .
the trouble he causes shall return to his own head . his violence shall come down on the crown of his own head .
< < For the Chief Musician ; on an instrument of Gath . a Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , our Lord , how majestic is your name in all the earth , who has set your glory above the heavens !
from the lips of Babes and infants you have established strength , because of your adversaries , that you might silence the enemy and the avenger .
when I consider your heavens , the work of your fingers , the moon and the stars , which you have ordained ;
what is man , that you think of him ? what is the son of man , that you care for him ?
you make him ruler over the works of your hands . you have put all things under his feet :
all sheep and cattle , yes , and the animals of the field ,
the birds of the sky , the fish of the sea , and whatever passes through the paths of the seas .
Yahweh , our Lord , how majestic is your name in all the earth !
< < For the Chief Musician . set to " The Death of the Son . " a Psalm by David . > > I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart . I will tell of all your marvelous works .
I will be glad and rejoice in you . I will sing praise to your name , O Most High .
when my enemies turn back , they stumble and perish in your presence .
for you have maintained my just cause . you sit on the throne judging righteously .
you have rebuked the nations . you have destroyed the wicked . you have blotted out their name forever and ever .
the enemy is overtaken by endless ruin . the very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished .
but Yahweh reigns forever . he has prepared his throne for judgment .
he will judge the world in righteousness . he will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness .
Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed ; a high tower in times of trouble .
those who know your name will put their trust in you , for you , Yahweh , have not forsaken those who seek you .
sing praises to Yahweh , who dwells in Zion , and declare among the people what he has done .
for he who avenges blood remembers them . he doesn 't forget the cry of the afflicted .
have mercy on me , Yahweh . see my affliction by those who hate me , and lift me up from the gates of death ;
that I may show forth all your praise . in the gates of the daughter of Zion , I will rejoice in your salvation .
the nations have sunk down in the pit that they made . in the net which they hid , their own foot is taken .
Yahweh has made himself known . he has executed judgment . the wicked is snared by the work of his own hands . Meditation . Selah .
the wicked shall be turned back to Sheol , even all the nations that forget God .
for the needy shall not always be forgotten , nor the hope of the poor perish forever .
arise , Yahweh ! Don 't let man prevail . let the nations be judged in your sight .
put them in fear , Yahweh . let the nations know that they are only men . Selah .
why do you stand far off , Yahweh ? why do you hide yourself in times of trouble ?
in arrogance , the wicked hunt down the weak . they are caught in the schemes that they devise .
for the wicked boasts of his heart 's cravings . he blesses the greedy , and condemns Yahweh .
the wicked , in the pride of his face , has no room in his thoughts for God .
his ways are prosperous at all times . he is haughty , and your laws are far from his sight . as for all his adversaries , he sneers at them .
he says in his heart , " I shall not be shaken . for generations I shall have no trouble . "
his mouth is full of cursing , deceit , and oppression . under his tongue is mischief and iniquity .
he lies in wait near the villages . from ambushes , he murders the innocent . his eyes are secretly set against the helpless .
he lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush . he lies in wait to catch the helpless . he catches the helpless , when he draws him in his net .
the helpless are crushed . they collapse . they fall under his strength .
he says in his heart , " God has forgotten . he hides his face . he will never see it . "
arise , Yahweh ! God , lift up your hand ! Don 't forget the helpless .
why does the wicked person condemn God , and say in his heart , " God won 't call me into account ? "
but you do see trouble and grief . you consider it to take it into your hand . you help the victim and the fatherless .
break the arm of the wicked . as for the evil man , seek out his wickedness until you find none .
Yahweh is King forever and ever ! the nations will perish out of his land .
Yahweh , you have heard the desire of the humble . you will prepare their heart . you will cause your ear to hear ,
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed , that man who is of the earth may terrify no more .
< < For the Chief Musician . by David . > > In Yahweh , I take refuge . how can you say to my soul , " flee as a bird to your mountain ! "
for , behold , the wicked bend their bows . they set their arrows on the strings , that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart .
if the foundations are destroyed , what can the righteous do ?
Yahweh is in his holy temple . Yahweh is on his throne in heaven . his eyes observe . his eyes examine the children of men .
Yahweh examines the righteous , but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates .
on the wicked he will rain blazing coals ; fire , sulfur , and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup .
for Yahweh is righteous . he loves righteousness . the upright shall see his face .
< < For the Chief Musician ; upon an eight @-@ stringed Lyre . a Psalm of David . > > Help , Yahweh ; for the godly man ceases . for the faithful fail from among the children of men .
everyone lies to his neighbor . they speak with flattering lips , and with a double heart .
May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips , and the tongue that boasts ,
who have said , " With our tongue we will prevail . our lips are our own . who is lord over us ? "
" because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy , I will now arise , " says Yahweh ; " I will set him in safety from those who malign him . "
the words of Yahweh are flawless words , as silver refined in a clay furnace , purified seven times .
you will keep them , Yahweh . you will preserve them from this generation forever .
the wicked walk on every side , when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > How long , Yahweh ? will you forget me forever ? how long will you hide your face from me ?
how long shall I take counsel in my soul , having sorrow in my heart every day ? how long shall my enemy triumph over me ?
behold , and answer me , Yahweh , my God . give light to my eyes , lest I sleep in death ;
Lest my enemy say , " I have prevailed against him " ; Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall .
but I trust in your loving kindness . my heart rejoices in your salvation .
I will sing to Yahweh , because he has been good to me .
< < For the Chief Musician . by David . > > The fool has said in his heart , " There is no God . " they are corrupt . they have done abominable works . there is none who does good .
Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men , to see if there were any who understood , who sought after God .
they have all gone aside . they have together become corrupt . there is none who does good , no , not one .
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge , who eat up my people as they eat bread , and don 't call on Yahweh ?
there they were in great fear , for God is in the generation of the righteous .
you frustrate the plan of the poor , because Yahweh is his refuge .
Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! when Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people , then Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , who shall dwell in your sanctuary ? who shall live on your holy hill ?
he who walks blamelessly does what is right , and speaks truth in his heart ;
he who doesn 't slander with his tongue , nor does evil to his friend , nor casts slurs against his fellow man ;
in whose eyes a vile man is despised , but who honors those who fear Yahweh ; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts , and doesn 't change ;
he who doesn 't lend out his money for usury , nor take a bribe against the innocent . he who does these things shall never be shaken .
< < A Poem by David . > > Preserve me , God , for in you do I take refuge .
my soul , you have said to Yahweh , " You are my Lord . apart from you I have no good thing . "
as for the saints who are in the earth , they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight .
their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god . their drink offerings of blood I will not offer , nor take their names on my lips .
Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup . you made my lot secure .
the lines have fallen to me in pleasant places . yes , I have a good inheritance .
I will bless Yahweh , who has given me counsel . yes , my heart instructs me in the night seasons .
I have set Yahweh always before me . because he is at my right hand , I shall not be moved .
therefore my heart is glad , and my tongue rejoices . my body shall also dwell in safety .
for you will not leave my soul in Sheol , neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption .
you will show me the path of life . in your presence is fullness of joy . in your right hand there are pleasures forevermore .
< < A Prayer by David . > > Hear , Yahweh , my righteous plea ; Give ear to my prayer , that doesn 't go out of deceitful lips .
let my sentence come forth from your presence . let your eyes look on equity .
you have proved my heart . you have visited me in the night . you have tried me , and found nothing . I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey .
as for the works of men , by the word of your lips , I have kept myself from the ways of the violent .
my steps have held fast to your paths . my feet have not slipped .
I have called on you , for you will answer me , God . turn your ear to me . hear my speech .
show your marvelous loving kindness , you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies .
keep me as the apple of your eye . hide me under the shadow of your wings ,
from the wicked who oppress me , my deadly enemies , who surround me .
they close up their callous hearts . with their mouth they speak proudly .
they have now surrounded us in our steps . they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth .
he is like a lion that is greedy of his prey , as it were a young lion lurking in secret places .
arise , Yahweh , confront him . cast him down . deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword ;
as for me , I shall see your face in righteousness . I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with seeing your form .
Yahweh is my rock , my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my rock , in whom I take refuge ; my shield , and the Horn of my salvation , my high tower .
I call on Yahweh , who is worthy to be praised ; and I am saved from my enemies .
the cords of death surrounded me . the floods of ungodliness made me afraid .
the cords of Sheol were around me . the snares of death came on me .
in my distress I called on Yahweh , and cried to my God . he heard my voice out of his temple . my cry before him came into his ears .
then the earth shook and trembled . the foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken , because he was angry .
smoke went out of his nostrils . consuming fire came out of his mouth . Coals were kindled by it .
he bowed the heavens also , and came down . thick darkness was under his feet .
he rode on a cherub , and flew . yes , he soared on the wings of the wind .
he made darkness his hiding place , his pavilion around him , darkness of waters , thick clouds of the skies .
at the brightness before him his thick clouds passed , hailstones and coals of fire .
Yahweh also thundered in the sky . the Most High uttered his voice : hailstones and coals of fire .
he sent out his arrows , and scattered them ; Yes , great lightning bolts , and routed them .
then the channels of waters appeared . the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke , Yahweh , at the blast of the breath of your nostrils .
he sent from on high . he took me . he drew me out of many waters .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , from those who hated me ; for they were too mighty for me .
they came on me in the day of my calamity , but Yahweh was my support .
he brought me forth also into a large place . he delivered me , because he delighted in me .
Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness . according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me .
for I have kept the ways of Yahweh , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
for all his ordinances were before me . I didn 't put away his statutes from me .
I was also blameless with him . I kept myself from my iniquity .
therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness , according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight .
with the merciful you will show yourself merciful . with the perfect man , you will show yourself perfect .
with the pure , you will show yourself pure . with the crooked you will show yourself shrewd .
for you will save the afflicted people , but the haughty eyes you will bring down .
for you will light my lamp , Yahweh . my God will light up my darkness .
for by you , I advance through a troop . by my God , I leap over a wall .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yahweh is tried . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
for who is God , except Yahweh ? who is a rock , besides our God ,
the God who arms me with strength , and makes my way perfect ?
he makes my feet like deer 's feet , and sets me on my high places .
he teaches my hands to war , so that my arms bend a bow of bronze .
you have also given me the shield of your salvation . your right hand sustains me . your gentleness has made me great .
you have enlarged my steps under me , My feet have not slipped .
I will pursue my enemies , and overtake them . neither will I turn again until they are consumed .
I will strike them through , so that they will not be able to rise . they shall fall under my feet .
for you have armed me with strength to the battle . you have subdued under me those who rose up against me .
you have also made my enemies turn their backs to me , that I might cut off those who hate me .
they cried , but there was none to save ; even to Yahweh , but he didn 't answer them .
then I beat them small as the dust before the wind . I cast them out as the mire of the streets .
you have delivered me from the strivings of the people . you have made me the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me . the foreigners shall submit themselves to me .
the foreigners shall fade away , and shall come trembling out of their close places .
Yahweh lives ; and blessed be my rock . Exalted be the God of my salvation ,
even the God who executes vengeance for me , and subdues peoples under me .
he rescues me from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
therefore I will give thanks to you , Yahweh , among the nations , and will sing praises to your name .
he gives great deliverance to his king , and shows loving kindness to his anointed , to David and to his seed , forevermore .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > The heavens declare the glory of God . the expanse shows his handiwork .
day after day they pour forth speech , and night after night they display knowledge .
there is no speech nor language , where their voice is not heard .
their voice has gone out through all the earth , their words to the end of the world . in them he has set a tent for the sun ,
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room , like a strong man rejoicing to run his course .
his going forth is from the end of the heavens , his circuit to its ends ; There is nothing hidden from its heat .
Yahweh 's law is perfect , restoring the soul . Yahweh 's testimony is sure , making wise the simple .
Yahweh 's precepts are right , rejoicing the heart . Yahweh 's commandment is pure , enlightening the eyes .
the fear of Yahweh is clean , enduring forever . Yahweh 's ordinances are true , and righteous altogether .
more to be desired are they than gold , yes , than much fine gold ; sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb .
moreover by them is your servant warned . in keeping them there is great reward .
who can discern his errors ? forgive me from hidden errors .
keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins . let them not have dominion over me . then I will be upright . I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble . May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high ,
send you help from the sanctuary , grant you support from Zion ,
remember all your offerings , and accept your burnt sacrifice . Selah .
May He grant you your heart 's desire , and fulfill all your counsel .
we will triumph in your salvation . in the name of our God , we will set up our banners . May Yahweh grant all your requests .
now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed . he will answer him from his holy heaven , with the saving strength of his right hand .
some trust in chariots , and some in horses , but we trust the name of Yahweh our God .
they are bowed down and fallen , but we rise up , and stand upright .
save , Yahweh ! let the King answer us when we call !
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > The king rejoices in your strength , Yahweh ! how greatly he rejoices in your salvation !
you have given him his heart 's desire , and have not withheld the request of his lips . Selah .
for you meet him with the blessings of Goodness . you set a crown of fine gold on his head .
he asked life of you , you gave it to him , even length of days forever and ever .
his glory is great in your salvation . you lay honor and majesty on him .
for you make him most blessed forever . you make him glad with joy in your presence .
for the king trusts in Yahweh . through the loving kindness of the Most High , he shall not be moved .
your hand will find out all of your enemies . your right hand will find out those who hate you .
you will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger . Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath . the fire shall devour them .
you will destroy their descendants from the earth , their posterity from among the children of men .
for they intended evil against you . they plotted evil against you which cannot succeed .
for you will make them turn their back , when you aim drawn bows at their face .
be exalted , Yahweh , in your strength , so we will sing and praise your power .
< < For the Chief Musician ; set to " The Doe of the Morning . " a Psalm by David . > > My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? why are you so far from helping me , and from the words of my groaning ?
my God , I cry in the daytime , but you don 't answer ; in the night season , and am not silent .
but you are holy , you who inhabit the praises of Israel .
our fathers trusted in you . they trusted , and you delivered them .
they cried to you , and were delivered . they trusted in you , and were not disappointed .
but I am a worm , and no man ; a reproach of men , and despised by the people .
all those who see me mock me . they insult me with their lips . they shake their heads , saying ,
" he trusts in Yahweh ; let him deliver him . let him rescue him , since he delights in him . "
but you brought me out of the womb . you made me trust at my mother 's breasts .
I was thrown on you from my mother 's womb . you are my God since my mother bore me .
Don 't be far from me , for trouble is near . for there is none to help .
many bulls have surrounded me . strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me .
they open their mouths wide against me , lions tearing prey and roaring .
I am poured out like water . all my bones are out of joint . my heart is like wax ; it is melted within me .
my strength is dried up like a potsherd . my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth . you have brought me into the dust of death .
for dogs have surrounded me . a company of evildoers have enclosed me . they have pierced my hands and feet .
I can count all of my bones . they look and stare at me .
they divide my garments among them . they cast lots for my clothing .
but don 't be far off , Yahweh . you are my help : hurry to help me .
deliver my soul from the sword , my precious life from the power of the dog .
save me from the lion 's mouth ! yes , from the horns of the wild oxen , you have answered me .
I will declare your name to my brothers . in the midst of the assembly , I will praise you .
you who fear Yahweh , praise him ! all you descendants of Jacob , glorify him ! stand in awe of him , all you descendants of Israel !
for he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted , Neither has he hidden his face from him ; but when he cried to him , he heard .
of you comes my praise in the great assembly . I will pay my vows before those who fear him .
the humble shall eat and be satisfied . they shall praise Yahweh who seek after him . let your hearts live forever .
all the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh . all the relatives of the nations shall worship before you .
for the kingdom is Yahweh 's . he is the ruler over the nations .
all the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship . all those who go down to the dust shall bow before him , even he who can 't keep his soul alive .
Posterity shall serve him . future generations shall be told about the Lord .
they shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born , for he has done it .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh is my shepherd : I shall lack nothing .
he makes me lie down in green pastures . he leads me beside still waters .
he restores my soul . he guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake .
even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for you are with me . your rod and your staff , they comfort me .
you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies . you anoint my head with oil . my cup runs over .
surely Goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life , and I will dwell in Yahweh 's house forever .
< < A Psalm by David . > > The earth is Yahweh 's , with its fullness ; the world , and those who dwell therein .
for he has founded it on the seas , and established it on the floods .
who may ascend to Yahweh 's hill ? who may stand in his holy place ?
he who has clean hands and a pure heart ; who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood , and has not sworn deceitfully .
he shall receive a blessing from Yahweh , righteousness from the God of his salvation .
this is the generation of those who seek Him , who seek your face--even Jacob . Selah .
lift up your heads , you gates ! be lifted up , you everlasting doors , and the King of glory will come in .
who is the King of glory ? Yahweh strong and mighty , Yahweh mighty in battle .
lift up your heads , you gates ; yes , lift them up , you everlasting doors , and the King of glory will come in .
who is this King of glory ? Yahweh of Armies is the King of glory ! Selah .
< < By David . > > To you , Yahweh , do I lift up my soul .
my God , I have trusted in you . Don 't let me be shamed . Don 't let my enemies triumph over me .
yes , no one who waits for you shall be shamed . they shall be shamed who deal treacherously without cause .
show me your ways , Yahweh . teach me your paths .
guide me in your truth , and teach me , For you are the God of my salvation , I wait for you all day long .
Yahweh , remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness , for they are from old times .
Don 't remember the sins of my youth , nor my transgressions . remember me according to your loving kindness , for your Goodness ' sake , Yahweh .
good and upright is Yahweh , therefore he will instruct sinners in the way .
he will guide the humble in justice . he will teach the humble his way .
all the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth to such as keep his Covenant and his testimonies .
for your name 's sake , Yahweh , pardon my iniquity , for it is great .
what man is he who fears Yahweh ? he shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose .
his soul shall dwell at ease . his seed shall inherit the land .
the friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him . he will show them his Covenant .
my eyes are ever on Yahweh , for he will pluck my feet out of the net .
turn to me , and have mercy on me , for I am desolate and afflicted .
the troubles of my heart are enlarged . Oh bring me out of my distresses .
consider my affliction and my travail . forgive all my sins .
consider my enemies , for they are many . they hate me with cruel hatred .
Oh keep my soul , and deliver me . let me not be disappointed , for I take refuge in you .
let integrity and uprightness preserve me , for I wait for you .
redeem Israel , God , out all of his troubles .
< < By David . > > Judge me , Yahweh , for I have walked in my integrity . I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering .
examine me , Yahweh , and prove me . try my heart and my mind .
for your loving kindness is before my eyes . I have walked in your truth .
I have not sat with deceitful men , neither will I go in with hypocrites .
I hate the assembly of evildoers , and will not sit with the wicked .
I will wash my hands in innocence , so I will go about your altar , Yahweh ;
that I may make the voice of Thanksgiving to be heard , and tell of all your wondrous works .
Yahweh , I love the habitation of your house , the place where your glory dwells .
Don 't gather my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloodthirsty men ;
in whose hands is wickedness , their right hand is full of bribes .
but as for me , I will walk in my integrity . redeem me , and be merciful to me .
my foot stands in an even place . in the congregations I will bless Yahweh .
< < By David . > > Yahweh is my light and my salvation . whom shall I fear ? Yahweh is the strength of my life . of whom shall I be afraid ?
when evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh , even my adversaries and my foes , they stumbled and fell .
though an army should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear . though war should rise against me , even then I will be confident .
for in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion . in the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me . he will lift me up on a rock .
now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me . I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent . I will sing , yes , I will sing praises to Yahweh .
hear , Yahweh , when I cry with my voice . have mercy also on me , and answer me .
when you said , " Seek my face , " my heart said to you , " I will seek your face , Yahweh . "
Don 't hide your face from me . Don 't put your servant away in anger . you have been my help . Don 't abandon me , neither forsake me , God of my salvation .
teach me your way , Yahweh . lead me in a straight path , because of my enemies .
Don 't deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries , for false witnesses have risen up against me , such as breathe out cruelty .
I am still confident of this : I will see the Goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living .
wait for Yahweh . be strong , and let your heart take courage . yes , wait for Yahweh .
< < By David . > > To you , Yahweh , I call . my rock , don 't be deaf to me ; lest , if you are silent to me , I would become like those who go down into the pit .
hear the voice of my petitions , when I cry to you , when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place .
Don 't draw me away with the wicked , with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors , but mischief is in their hearts .
give them according to their work , and according to the wickedness of their doings . give them according to the operation of their hands . bring back on them what they deserve .
because they don 't respect the works of Yahweh , nor the operation of his hands , he will break them down and not build them up .
blessed be Yahweh , because he has heard the voice of my petitions .
Yahweh is my strength and my shield . my heart has trusted in him , and I am helped . therefore my heart greatly rejoices . with my song I will thank him .
Yahweh is their strength . he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed .
save your people , and bless your inheritance . be their shepherd also , and bear them up forever .
Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name . worship Yahweh in holy array .
Yahweh 's voice is on the waters . the God of glory thunders , even Yahweh on many waters .
Yahweh 's voice is powerful . Yahweh 's voice is full of majesty .
the voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars . yes , Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon .
he makes them also to skip like a calf ; Lebanon and Sirion like a young , wild ox .
Yahweh 's voice strikes with flashes of lightning .
Yahweh 's voice makes the deer calve , and strips the forests bare . in his temple everything says , " Glory ! "
Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood . yes , Yahweh sits as King forever .
Yahweh will give strength to his people . Yahweh will bless his people with peace .
< < A Psalm . a Song for the Dedication of the Temple . by David . > > I will extol you , Yahweh , for you have raised me up , and have not made my foes to rejoice over me .
Yahweh my God , I cried to you , and you have healed me .
Yahweh , you have brought up my soul from Sheol . you have kept me alive , that I should not go down to the pit .
sing praise to Yahweh , you saints of his . give thanks to his holy name .
for his anger is but for a moment . his favor is for a lifetime . weeping may stay for the night , but joy comes in the morning .
as for me , I said in my prosperity , " I shall never be moved . "
you , Yahweh , when you favored me , made my mountain stand strong ; but when you hid your face , I was troubled .
I cried to you , Yahweh . to Yahweh I made supplication :
" what profit is there in my destruction , if I go down to the pit ? shall the dust praise you ? shall it declare your truth ?
hear , Yahweh , and have mercy on me . Yahweh , be my helper . "
you have turned my mourning into dancing for me . you have removed my sackcloth , and clothed me with gladness ,
to the end that my heart may sing praise to you , and not be silent . Yahweh my God , I will give thanks to you forever !
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > In you , Yahweh , I take refuge . let me never be disappointed . deliver me in your righteousness .
bow down your ear to me . deliver me speedily . be to me a strong rock , a house of defense to save me .
for you are my rock and my fortress , therefore for your name 's sake lead me and guide me .
Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me , for you are my stronghold .
into your hand I commend my spirit . you redeem me , Yahweh , God of truth .
I hate those who regard lying vanities , but I trust in Yahweh .
I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness , for you have seen my affliction . you have known my soul in adversities .
you have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy . you have set my feet in a large place .
have mercy on me , Yahweh , for I am in distress . my eye , my soul , and my body waste away with grief .
for my life is spent with sorrow , my years with sighing . my strength fails because of my iniquity . my bones are wasted away .
because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors , A fear to my acquaintances . those who saw me on the street fled from me .
I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man . I am like broken pottery .
for I have heard the slander of many , terror on every side , while they conspire together against me , they plot to take away my life .
but I trust in you , Yahweh . I said , " You are my God . "
my times are in your hand . deliver me from the hand of my enemies , and from those who persecute me .
make your face to shine on your servant . save me in your loving kindness .
let me not be disappointed , Yahweh , for I have called on you . let the wicked be disappointed . let them be silent in Sheol .
let the lying lips be mute , which speak against the righteous insolently , with pride and contempt .
Oh how great is your Goodness , which you have laid up for those who fear you , which you have worked for those who take refuge in you , before the sons of men !
in the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man . you will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues .
praise be to Yahweh , for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city .
as for me , I said in my haste , " I am cut off from before your eyes . " nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when I cried to you .
Oh love Yahweh , all you his saints ! Yahweh preserves the faithful , and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly .
be strong , and let your heart take courage , all you who hope in Yahweh .
< < By David . a contemplative psalm . > > blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven , whose sin is covered .
blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn 't impute iniquity , in whose spirit there is no deceit .
when I kept silence , my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long .
for day and night your hand was heavy on me . my strength was sapped in the heat of summer . Selah .
I acknowledged my sin to you . I didn 't hide my iniquity . I said , I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh , and you forgave the iniquity of my sin . Selah .
for this , let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found . surely when the great waters overflow , they shall not reach to him .
you are my hiding place . you will preserve me from trouble . you will surround me with songs of deliverance . Selah .
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go . I will counsel you with my eye on you .
Don 't be like the horse , or like the mule , which have no understanding , who are controlled by bit and bridle , or else they will not come near to you .
many sorrows come to the wicked , but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh .
be glad in Yahweh , and rejoice , you righteous ! shout for joy , all you who are upright in heart !
rejoice in Yahweh , you righteous ! praise is fitting for the upright .
give thanks to Yahweh with the Lyre . sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings .
sing to him a new song . play skillfully with a shout of joy !
for the word of Yahweh is right . all his work is done in faithfulness .
he loves righteousness and justice . the earth is full of the loving kindness of Yahweh .
by Yahweh 's word , the heavens were made ; all their army by the breath of his mouth .
he gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap . he lays up the deeps in storehouses .
let all the earth fear Yahweh . let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him .
for he spoke , and it was done . he commanded , and it stood firm .
Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing . he makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect .
the counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever , the thoughts of his heart to all generations .
blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh , the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance .
Yahweh looks from heaven . he sees all the sons of men .
from the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth ,
he who fashions all of their hearts ; and he considers all of their works .
there is no king saved by the multitude of an army . a mighty man is not delivered by great strength .
a horse is a vain thing for safety , neither does he deliver any by his great power .
behold , Yahweh 's eye is on those who fear him , on those who hope in his loving kindness ;
to deliver their soul from death , to keep them alive in famine .
our soul has waited for Yahweh . he is our help and our shield .
for our heart rejoices in him , because we have trusted in his holy name .
let your loving kindness be on us , Yahweh , since we have hoped in you .
Oh magnify Yahweh with me . let us exalt his name together .
I sought Yahweh , and he answered me , and delivered me from all my fears .
they looked to him , and were radiant . their faces shall never be covered with shame .
this poor man cried , and Yahweh heard him , and saved him out of all his troubles .
the angel of Yahweh encamps around those who fear him , and delivers them .
Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good . blessed is the man who takes refuge in him .
Oh fear Yahweh , you his saints , for there is no lack with those who fear him .
the young lions do lack , and suffer hunger , but those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any good thing .
come , you children , listen to me . I will teach you the fear of Yahweh .
who is someone who desires life , and loves many days , that he may see good ?
keep your tongue from evil , and your lips from speaking lies .
depart from evil , and do good. seek peace , and pursue it .
Yahweh 's eyes are toward the righteous . his ears listen to their cry .
Yahweh 's face is against those who do evil , to cut off their memory from the earth .
the righteous cry , and Yahweh hears , and delivers them out of all their troubles .
Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart , and saves those who have a crushed spirit .
many are the afflictions of the righteous , but Yahweh delivers him out of them all .
he protects all of his bones . not one of them is broken .
evil shall kill the wicked . those who hate the righteous shall be condemned .
Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants . none of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned .
< < By David . > > contend , Yahweh , with those who contend with me . fight against those who fight against me .
Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me . tell my soul , " I am your salvation . "
let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor . let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded .
let them be as chaff before the wind , Yahweh 's angel driving them on .
let their way be dark and slippery , Yahweh 's angel pursuing them .
for without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me . without cause they have dug a pit for my soul .
let destruction come on him unawares . let his net that he has hidden catch himself . let him fall into that destruction .
my soul shall be joyful in Yahweh . it shall rejoice in his salvation .
all my bones shall say , " Yahweh , who is like you , who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him ; yes , the poor and the needy from him who robs him ? "
Unrighteous witnesses rise up . they ask me about things that I don 't know about .
they reward me evil for good , to the bereaving of my soul .
but in my adversity , they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together . the attackers gathered themselves together against me , and I didn 't know it . they tore at me , and didn 't cease .
like the profane mockers in feasts , they gnashed their teeth at me .
Lord , how long will you look on ? rescue my soul from their destruction , my precious life from the lions .
I will give you thanks in the great assembly . I will praise you among many people .
Don 't let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me ; neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes .
for they don 't speak peace , but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land .
yes , they opened their mouth wide against me . they said , " Aha ! Aha ! our eye has seen it ! "
you have seen it , Yahweh . Don 't keep silent . Lord , don 't be far from me .
wake up ! rise up to defend me , my God ! my Lord , contend for me !
vindicate me , Yahweh my God , according to your righteousness . Don 't let them gloat over me .
Don 't let them say in their heart , " Aha ! that 's the way we want it ! " Don 't let them say , " We have swallowed him up ! "
let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity . let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me .
let them shout for joy and be glad , who favor my righteous cause . yes , let them say continually , " Yahweh be magnified , who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant ! "
my tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long .
< < For the Chief Musician . by David , the servant of Yahweh . > > An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked : " there is no fear of God before his eyes . "
for he flatters himself in his own eyes , too much to detect and hate his sin .
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit . he has ceased to be wise and to do good .
he plots iniquity on his bed . he sets himself in a way that is not good . he doesn 't abhor evil .
your loving kindness , Yahweh , is in the heavens . your faithfulness reaches to the skies .
your righteousness is like the mountains of God . your judgments are like a great deep . Yahweh , you preserve man and animal .
how precious is your loving kindness , God ! the children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings .
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house . you will make them drink of the river of your pleasures .
for with you is the spring of life . in your light shall we see light .
Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you , your righteousness to the upright in heart .
Don 't let the foot of pride come against me . Don 't let the hand of the wicked drive me away .
there the workers of iniquity are fallen . they are thrust down , and shall not be able to rise .
< < By David . > > Don 't fret because of evildoers , neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness .
for they shall soon be cut down like the grass , and wither like the green herb .
trust in Yahweh , and do good . dwell in the land , and enjoy safe pasture .
also delight yourself in Yahweh , and he will give you the desires of your heart .
commit your way to Yahweh . trust also in him , and he will do this :
he will make your righteousness go forth as the light , and your justice as the noon day sun .
rest in Yahweh , and wait patiently for him . Don 't fret because of him who prospers in his way , because of the man who makes wicked plots happen .
cease from anger , and forsake wrath . Don 't fret , it leads only to evildoing .
for evildoers shall be cut off , but those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land .
for yet a little while , and the wicked will be no more . yes , though you look for his place , he isn 't there .
but the humble shall inherit the land , and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace .
the wicked plots against the just , and gnashes at him with his teeth .
the Lord will laugh at him , for he sees that his day is coming .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , to kill those who are upright in the way .
their sword shall enter into their own heart . their bows shall be broken .
better is a little that the righteous has , than the abundance of many wicked .
for the arms of the wicked shall be broken , but Yahweh upholds the righteous .
Yahweh knows the days of the perfect . their inheritance shall be forever .
they shall not be disappointed in the time of evil . in the days of famine they shall be satisfied .
but the wicked shall perish . the enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields . they will vanish-- vanish like smoke .
the wicked borrow , and don 't pay back , but the righteous give generously .
for such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land . those who are Cursed by him shall be cut off .
a man 's goings are established by Yahweh . he delights in his way .
though he stumble , he shall not fall , for Yahweh holds him up with his hand .
I have been young , and now am old , yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his children begging for bread .
all day long he deals graciously , and lends . his seed is blessed .
depart from evil , and do good . live securely forever .
for Yahweh loves justice , and doesn 't forsake his saints . they are preserved forever , but the children of the wicked shall be cut off .
the righteous shall inherit the land , and live in it forever .
the mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom . his tongue speaks justice .
the law of his God is in his heart . none of his steps shall slide .
the wicked watches the righteous , and seeks to kill him .
Yahweh will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged .
wait for Yahweh , and keep his way , and he will exalt you to inherit the land . when the wicked are cut off , you shall see it .
I have seen the wicked in great power , spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil .
but he passed away , and behold , he was not . yes , I sought him , but he could not be found .
mark the perfect man , and see the upright , for there is a future for the man of peace .
as for transgressors , they shall be destroyed together . the future of the wicked shall be cut off .
but the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh . he is their stronghold in the time of trouble .
Yahweh helps them , and rescues them . he rescues them from the wicked , and saves them , Because they have taken refuge in him .
< < A Psalm by David , for a memorial . > > Yahweh , don 't rebuke me in your wrath , neither chasten me in your hot displeasure .
for your arrows have pierced me , your hand presses hard on me .
there is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation , neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin .
for my iniquities have gone over my head . as a heavy burden , they are too heavy for me .
my wounds are loathsome and corrupt , because of my foolishness .
I am pained and bowed down greatly . I go mourning all day long .
for my waist is filled with burning . there is no soundness in my flesh .
I am faint and severely bruised . I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart .
Lord , all my desire is before you . my groaning is not hidden from you .
my heart throbs . my strength fails me . as for the light of my eyes , it has also left me .
my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague . my kinsmen stand far away .
they also who seek after my life lay snares . those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things , and meditate deceits all day long .
but I , as a deaf man , don 't hear . I am as a mute man who doesn 't open his mouth .
yes , I am as a man who doesn 't hear , in whose mouth are no reproofs .
for in you , Yahweh , do I hope . you will answer , Lord my God .
for I said , " Don 't let them gloat over me , or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips . "
for I am ready to fall . my pain is continually before me .
for I will declare my iniquity . I will be sorry for my sin .
but my enemies are vigorous and many . those who hate me without reason are numerous .
they who also render evil for good are adversaries to me , because I follow what is good .
Don 't forsake me , Yahweh . my God , don 't be far from me .
hurry to help me , Lord , my salvation .
< < For the Chief Musician . for Jeduthun . a Psalm by David . > > I said , " I will watch my ways , so that I don 't sin with my tongue . I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me . "
I was mute with silence . I held my peace , even from good . my sorrow was stirred .
my heart was hot within me . while I meditated , the fire burned : I spoke with my tongue :
" Yahweh , show me my end , what is the measure of my days . let me know how frail I am .
behold , you have made my days handbreadths . my lifetime is as nothing before you . surely every man stands as a breath . " Selah .
" surely every man walks like a shadow . surely they busy themselves in vain . he heaps up , and doesn 't know who shall gather .
now , Lord , what do I wait for ? my hope is in you .
deliver me from all my transgressions . Don 't make me the reproach of the foolish .
I was mute . I didn 't open my mouth , because you did it .
remove your scourge away from me . I am overcome by the blow of your hand .
when you rebuke and correct man for iniquity , You consume his wealth like a moth . surely every man is but a breath . " Selah .
" hear my prayer , Yahweh , and give ear to my cry . Don 't be silent at my tears . for I am a stranger with you , a foreigner , as all my fathers were .
Oh spare me , that I may recover strength , before I go away , and exist no more . "
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > I waited patiently for Yahweh . he turned to me , and heard my cry .
he brought me up also out of a horrible pit , out of the miry clay . he set my feet on a rock , and gave me a firm place to stand .
he has put a new song in my mouth , even praise to our God . many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in Yahweh .
blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust , and doesn 't respect the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
sacrifice and offering you didn 't desire . you have opened my ears . you have not required burnt offering and sin offering .
I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly . behold , I will not seal my lips , Yahweh , you know .
I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart . I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation . I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly .
Don 't withhold your tender mercies from me , Yahweh . let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me .
for innumerable evils have surrounded me . my iniquities have overtaken me , so that I am not able to look up . they are more than the hairs of my head . my heart has failed me .
be pleased , Yahweh , to deliver me . hurry to help me , Yahweh .
let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it . let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt .
let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me , " Aha ! Aha ! "
let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . let such as love your salvation say continually , " Let Yahweh be exalted ! "
but I am poor and needy . May the Lord think about me . you are my help and my deliverer . Don 't delay , my God .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > blessed is he who considers the poor . Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil .
Yahweh will preserve him , and keep him alive . he shall be blessed on the earth , and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies .
Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed , and restore him from his bed of illness .
my enemies speak evil against me : " when will he die , and his name perish ? "
if he comes to see me , he speaks falsehood . his heart gathers iniquity to itself . when he goes abroad , he tells it .
all who hate me whisper together against me . they imagine the worst for me .
" an evil disease , " they say , " has afflicted him . now that he lies he shall rise up no more . "
yes , my own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , who ate bread with me , has lifted up his heel against me .
but you , Yahweh , have mercy on me , and raise me up , that I may repay them .
by this I know that you delight in me , because my enemy doesn 't triumph over me .
as for me , you uphold me in my integrity , and set me in your presence forever .
blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , from everlasting and to everlasting ! Amen and amen .
< < For the Chief Musician . a contemplation by the sons of Korah . > > As the deer pants for the water brooks , so my soul pants after you , God .
my soul thirsts for God , for the living God . when shall I come and appear before God ?
my tears have been my food day and night , while they continually ask me , " Where is your God ? "
why are you in despair , my soul ? why are you disturbed within me ? hope in God ! for I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence .
Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime . in the night his song shall be with me : a prayer to the God of my life .
I will ask God , my rock , " Why have you forgotten me ? why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ? "
as with a sword in my bones , my adversaries reproach me , while they continually ask me , " Where is your God ? "
why are you in despair , my soul ? why are you disturbed within me ? hope in God ! for I shall still praise him , the saving help of my countenance , and my God .
vindicate me , God , and plead my cause against an ungodly nation . Oh , deliver me from deceitful and wicked men .
for you are the God of my strength . why have you rejected me ? why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
Oh , send out your light and your truth . let them lead me . let them bring me to your holy hill , To your tents .
then I will go to the altar of God , to God , my exceeding joy . I will praise you on the harp , God , my God .
why are you in despair , my soul ? why are you disturbed within me ? hope in God ! for I shall still praise him : my Savior , my helper , and my God .
< < For the Chief Musician . by the sons of Korah . a contemplative psalm . > > We have heard with our ears , God ; our fathers have told us , what work you did in their days , in the days of old .
you drove out the nations with your hand , but you planted them . you afflicted the peoples , but you spread them abroad .
for they didn 't get the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them ; but your right hand , and your arm , and the light of your face , because you were favorable to them .
you are my King , God . command victories for Jacob !
through you , will we push down our adversaries . through your name , will we tread them under who rise up against us .
for I will not trust in my bow , neither shall my sword save me .
but you have saved us from our adversaries , and have shamed those who hate us .
in God we have made our boast all day long , we will give thanks to your name forever . Selah .
but now you rejected us , and brought us to dishonor , and don 't go out with our armies .
you make us turn back from the adversary . those who hate us take spoil for themselves .
you have made us like sheep for food , and have scattered us among the nations .
you sell your people for nothing , and have gained nothing from their sale .
you make us a reproach to our neighbors , a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us .
you make us a byword among the nations , a shaking of the head among the peoples .
all day long my dishonor is before me , and shame covers my face ,
at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses , because of the enemy and the avenger .
all this has come on us , yet have we not forgotten you , Neither have we been false to your Covenant .
our heart has not turned back , neither have our steps strayed from your path ,
though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals , and covered us with the shadow of death .
if we have forgotten the name of our God , or spread forth our hands to a strange god ;
won 't God search this out ? for he knows the secrets of the heart .
yes , for your sake we are killed all day long . we are regarded as sheep for the slaughter .
wake up ! why do you sleep , Lord ? arise ! Don 't reject us forever .
why do you hide your face , and forget our affliction and our oppression ?
for our soul is bowed down to the dust . our body clings to the earth .
rise up to help us . redeem us for your loving kindness ' sake .
< < For the Chief Musician . set to " The Lilies . " a contemplation by the sons of Korah . a wedding song . > > My heart overflows with a noble theme . I recite my verses for the king . my tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer .
you are the most excellent of the sons of men . grace has anointed your lips , therefore God has blessed you forever .
Strap your sword on your thigh , mighty one : your splendor and your majesty .
in your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth , humility , and righteousness . let your right hand display awesome deeds .
your arrows are sharp . the nations fall under you , with arrows in the heart of the king 's enemies .
your throne , God , is forever and ever . a scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom .
you have loved righteousness , and hated wickedness . therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows .
all your garments smell like myrrh , aloes , and cassia . out of Ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad .
Kings ' daughters are among your honorable women . at your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir .
listen , daughter , consider , and turn your ear . forget your own people , and also your father 's house .
so the king will desire your beauty , honor him , for he is your lord .
the daughter of Tyre comes with a gift . the rich among the people entreat your favor .
the princess inside is all glorious . her clothing is interwoven with gold .
she shall be led to the king in embroidered work . the virgins , her companions who follow her , shall be brought to you .
with gladness and rejoicing they shall be led . they shall enter into the king 's palace .
your sons will take the place of your fathers . you shall make them princes in all the earth .
< < For the Chief Musician . by the sons of Korah . according to Alamoth.Alamoth is a musical term . > > God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .
therefore we won 't be afraid , though the earth changes , though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas ;
though its waters roar and are troubled , though the mountains tremble with their swelling . Selah .
there is a river , the streams of which make the city of God glad , the holy place of the tents of the Most High .
God is in her midst . she shall not be moved . God will help her at dawn .
the nations raged . the kingdoms were moved . he lifted his voice , and the earth melted .
Yahweh of Armies is with us . the God of Jacob is our refuge . Selah .
come , see Yahweh 's works , what desolations he has made in the earth .
he makes wars cease to the end of the earth . he breaks the bow , and shatters the spear . he burns the chariots in the fire .
" be still , and know that I am God . I will be exalted among the nations . I will be exalted in the earth . "
Yahweh of Armies is with us . the God of Jacob is our refuge . Selah .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Oh clap your hands , all you nations . shout to God with the voice of triumph !
for Yahweh Most High is awesome . he is a great King over all the earth .
he subdues nations under us , and peoples under our feet .
he chooses our inheritance for us , the glory of Jacob whom he loved . Selah .
God has gone up with a shout , Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet .
for God is the King of all the earth . sing praises with understanding .
God reigns over the nations . God sits on his holy throne .
the princes of the peoples are gathered together , the people of the God of Abraham . for the shields of the earth belong to God . he is greatly exalted !
< < A Song . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised , in the city of our God , in his holy mountain .
beautiful in elevation , the joy of the whole earth , is Mount Zion , on the north sides , the city of the great King .
God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge .
for , behold , the kings assembled themselves , they passed by together .
they saw it , then they were amazed . they were dismayed . they hurried away .
Trembling took hold of them there , pain , as of a woman in travail .
with the east wind , you break the ships of Tarshish .
as we have heard , so we have seen , in the city of Yahweh of Armies , in the city of our God . God will establish it forever . Selah .
we have thought about your loving kindness , God , in the midst of your temple .
as is your name , God , so is your praise to the ends of the earth . your right hand is full of righteousness .
let Mount Zion be glad ! let the daughters of Judah rejoice , Because of your judgments .
walk about Zion , and go around her . number its towers .
mark well her bulwarks . consider her palaces , that you may tell it to the next generation .
for this God is our God forever and ever . he will be our guide even to death .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Hear this , all you peoples . listen , all you inhabitants of the world ,
both low and high , rich and poor together .
my mouth will speak words of wisdom . my heart shall utter understanding .
I will incline my ear to a proverb . I will open my riddle on the harp .
why should I fear in the days of evil , when iniquity at my heels surrounds me ?
those who trust in their wealth , and boast in the multitude of their riches--
none of them can by any means redeem his brother , nor give God a ransom for him .
for the redemption of their life is costly , no payment is ever enough ,
that he should live on forever , that he should not see corruption .
for he sees that wise men die ; likewise the fool and the senseless perish , and leave their wealth to others .
but man , despite his riches , doesn 't endure . he is like the animals that perish .
this is the destiny of those who are foolish , and of those who approve their sayings . Selah .
they are appointed as a flock for Sheol . death shall be their shepherd . the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning . their beauty shall decay in Sheol , far from their mansion .
but God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol , for he will receive me . Selah .
Don 't be afraid when a man is made rich , when the glory of his house is increased .
for when he dies he shall carry nothing away . his glory shall not descend after him .
though while he lived he blessed his soul-- and men praise you when you do well for yourself--
he shall go to the generation of his fathers . they shall never see the light .
a man who has riches without understanding , is like the animals that perish .
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > The mighty One , God , Yahweh , speaks , and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset .
out of Zion , the perfection of beauty , God shines forth .
our God comes , and does not keep silent . a fire devours before him . it is very stormy around him .
he calls to the heavens above , to the earth , that he may judge his people :
" gather my saints together to me , those who have made a Covenant with me by sacrifice . "
the heavens shall declare his righteousness , for God himself is judge . Selah .
" hear , my people , and I will speak ; Israel , and I will testify against you . I am God , your God .
I don 't rebuke you for your sacrifices . your burnt offerings are continually before me .
I have no need for a bull from your stall , nor male goats from your pens .
for every animal of the forest is mine , and the livestock on a thousand hills .
I know all the birds of the mountains . the wild animals of the field are mine .
if I were hungry , I would not tell you , for the world is mine , and all that is in it .
will I eat the flesh of bulls , or drink the blood of goats ?
offer to God the sacrifice of Thanksgiving . pay your vows to the Most High .
call on me in the day of trouble . I will deliver you , and you will honor me . "
but to the wicked God says , " What right do you have to declare my statutes , that you have taken my Covenant on your lips ,
since you hate instruction , and throw my words behind you ?
when you saw a thief , you consented with him , and have participated with adulterers .
" you give your mouth to evil . your tongue frames deceit .
you sit and speak against your brother . you slander your own mother 's son .
you have done these things , and I kept silent . you thought that I was just like you . I will rebuke you , and accuse you in front of your eyes .
" now consider this , you who forget God , lest I tear you into pieces , and there be none to deliver .
whoever offers the sacrifice of Thanksgiving glorifies me , and prepares his way so that I will show God 's salvation to him . "
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David , when Nathan the prophet came to him , after he had gone in to Bathsheba . > > Have mercy on me , God , according to your loving kindness . according to the multitude of your tender mercies , blot out my transgressions .
wash me thoroughly from my iniquity . cleanse me from my sin .
for I know my transgressions . my sin is constantly before me .
against you , and you only , have I sinned , and done that which is evil in your sight ; that you may be proved right when you speak , and justified when you judge .
behold , I was brought forth in iniquity . in sin my mother conceived me .
behold , you desire truth in the inward parts . you teach me wisdom in the inmost place .
purify me with hyssop , and I will be clean . wash me , and I will be whiter than snow .
let me hear joy and gladness , That the bones which you have broken may rejoice .
hide your face from my sins , and blot out all of my iniquities .
create in me a clean heart , O God . renew a right spirit within me .
restore to me the joy of your salvation . uphold me with a willing spirit .
then I will teach transgressors your ways . Sinners shall be converted to you .
deliver me from bloodguiltiness , O God , the God of my salvation . my tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness .
Lord , open my lips . my mouth shall declare your praise .
for you don 't delight in sacrifice , or else I would give it . you have no pleasure in burnt offering .
the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit . a broken and contrite heart , O God , you will not despise .
do well in your good pleasure to Zion . build the walls of Jerusalem .
then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness , in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings . then they will offer bulls on your altar .
you love evil more than good , lying rather than speaking the truth . Selah .
you love all devouring words , you deceitful tongue .
God will likewise destroy you forever . he will take you up , and pluck you out of your tent , and root you out of the land of the living . Selah .
the righteous also will see it , and fear , and laugh at him , saying ,
" behold , this is the man who didn 't make God his strength , but trusted in the abundance of his riches , and strengthened himself in his wickedness . "
but as for me , I am like a green olive tree in God 's house . I trust in God 's loving kindness forever and ever .
I will give you thanks forever , because you have done it . I will hope in your name , for it is good , in the presence of your saints .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Mahalath . " a contemplation by David . > > The fool has said in his heart , " There is no God . " they are corrupt , and have done abominable iniquity . there is no one who does good .
God looks down from heaven on the children of men , to see if there are any who understood , who seek after God .
every one of them has gone back . they have become filthy together . there is no one who does good , no , not one .
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge , who eat up my people as they eat bread , and don 't call on God ?
there they were in great fear , where no fear was , for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you . you have put them to shame , because God has rejected them .
Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! when God brings back his people from captivity , then Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
< < For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a contemplation by David , when the Ziphites came and said to Saul , " Isn 't David hiding himself among us ? " > > Save me , God , by your name . vindicate me in your might .
hear my prayer , God . listen to the words of my mouth .
for strangers have risen up against me . violent men have sought after my soul . they haven 't set God before them . Selah .
behold , God is my helper . the Lord is the one who sustains my soul .
he will repay the evil to my enemies . destroy them in your truth .
with a free will offering , I will sacrifice to you . I will give thanks to your name , Yahweh , for it is good .
for he has delivered me out of all trouble . my eye has seen triumph over my enemies .
< < For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a contemplation by David . > > listen to my prayer , God . Don 't hide yourself from my supplication .
attend to me , and answer me . I am restless in my complaint , and moan ,
because of the voice of the enemy , Because of the oppression of the wicked . for they bring suffering on me . in anger they hold a grudge against me .
my heart is severely pained within me . the terrors of death have fallen on me .
Fearfulness and trembling have come on me . horror has overwhelmed me .
I said , " Oh that I had wings like a dove ! then I would fly away , and be at rest .
behold , then I would wander far off . I would lodge in the wilderness . " Selah .
" I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm . "
confuse them , Lord , and confound their language , for I have seen violence and strife in the city .
day and night they prowl around on its walls . Malice and abuse are also within her .
destructive forces are within her . threats and lies don 't depart from her streets .
for it was not an enemy who insulted me , then I could have endured it . neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me , then I would have hidden myself from him .
but it was you , a man like me , my companion , and my familiar friend .
we took sweet fellowship together . we walked in God 's house with company .
let death come suddenly on them . let them go down alive into Sheol . for wickedness is in their dwelling , in their midst .
as for me , I will call on God . Yahweh will save me .
evening , morning , and at noon , I will cry out in distress . he will hear my voice .
he has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me , although there are many who oppose me .
God , who is enthroned forever , will hear , and answer them . Selah . they never change , who don 't fear God .
he raises his hands against his friends . he has violated his Covenant .
his mouth was smooth as butter , but his heart was war . his words were softer than oil , yet they were drawn swords .
cast your burden on Yahweh , and he will sustain you . he will never allow the righteous to be moved .
but you , God , will bring them down into the pit of destruction . bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days , but I will trust in you .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Silent Dove in distant Lands . " a poem by David , when the Philistines seized him in Gath . > > Be merciful to me , God , for man wants to swallow me up . all day long , he attacks and oppresses me .
my enemies want to swallow me up all day long , for they are many who fight proudly against me .
when I am afraid , I will put my trust in you .
in God , I praise his word . in God , I put my trust . I will not be afraid . what can flesh do to me ?
all day long they twist my words . all their thoughts are against me for evil .
they conspire and lurk , watching my steps , they are eager to take my life .
shall they escape by iniquity ? in anger cast down the peoples , God .
you number my wanderings . you put my tears into your bottle . Aren 't they in your book ?
then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call . I know this , that God is for me .
I have put my trust in God . I will not be afraid . what can man do to me ?
your vows are on me , God . I will give thank offerings to you .
for you have delivered my soul from death , and prevented my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a poem by David , when he fled from Saul , in the cave . > > Be merciful to me , God , be merciful to me , for my soul takes refuge in you . yes , in the shadow of your wings , I will take refuge , until disaster has passed .
I cry out to God Most High , to God who accomplishes my requests for me .
he will send from heaven , and save me , he rebukes the one who is pursuing me . Selah . God will send out his loving kindness and his truth .
my soul is among lions . I lie among those who are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
be exalted , God , above the heavens ! let your glory be above all the earth !
they have prepared a net for my steps . my soul is bowed down . they dig a pit before me . they fall into its midst themselves . Selah .
my heart is steadfast , God , my heart is steadfast . I will sing , yes , I will sing praises .
wake up , my glory ! wake up , psaltery and harp ! I will wake up the dawn .
I will give thanks to you , Lord , among the peoples . I will sing praises to you among the nations .
for your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens , and your truth to the skies .
be exalted , God , above the heavens . let your glory be over all the earth .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a poem by David . > > Do you indeed speak righteousness , silent ones ? do you judge blamelessly , you sons of men ?
no , in your heart you plot injustice . you measure out the violence of your hands in the earth .
the wicked go astray from the womb . they are wayward as soon as they are born , speaking lies .
their poison is like the poison of a snake ; like a deaf Cobra that stops its ear ,
which doesn 't listen to the voice of charmers , no matter how skillful the charmer may be .
break their teeth , God , in their mouth . break out the great teeth of the young lions , Yahweh .
let them vanish as water that flows away . when they draw the bow , let their arrows be made blunt .
let them be like a snail which melts and passes away , like the stillborn child , who has not seen the sun .
before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns , he will sweep away the green and the burning alike .
the righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance . he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked ;
so that men shall say , " Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous . most certainly there is a God who judges the earth . "
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a poem by David , when Saul sent , and they watched the house to kill him . > > Deliver me from my enemies , my God . set me on high from those who rise up against me .
deliver me from the workers of iniquity . save me from the bloodthirsty men .
for , behold , they lie in wait for my soul . the mighty gather themselves together against me , not for my disobedience , nor for my sin , Yahweh .
I have done no wrong , yet they are ready to attack me . rise up , behold , and help me !
you , Yahweh God of Armies , the God of Israel , rouse yourself to punish the nations . show no mercy to the wicked traitors . Selah .
they return at evening , howling like dogs , and prowl around the city .
behold , they spew with their mouth . swords are in their lips , " For , " they say , " who hears us ? "
but you , Yahweh , laugh at them . you scoff at all the nations .
Oh , my Strength , I watch for you , for God is my high tower .
my God will go before me with his loving kindness . God will let me look at my enemies in triumph .
Don 't kill them , or my people may forget . Scatter them by your power , and bring them down , Lord our shield .
for the sin of their mouth , and the words of their lips , let them be caught in their pride , for the curses and lies which they utter .
consume them in wrath . consume them , and they will be no more . let them know that God rules in Jacob , to the ends of the earth . Selah .
at evening let them return . let them howl like a dog , and go around the city .
they shall wander up and down for food , and wait all night if they aren 't satisfied .
but I will sing of your strength . yes , I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning . for you have been my high tower , a refuge in the day of my distress .
to you , my strength , I will sing praises . for God is my high tower , the God of my mercy .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " The Lily of the Covenant . " a teaching poem by David , when he fought with Aram Naharaim and with Aram Zobah , and Joab returned , and killed twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt . > > God , you have rejected us . you have broken us down . you have been angry . restore us , again .
you have made the land tremble . you have torn it . mend its fractures , for it quakes .
you have shown your people hard things . you have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger .
you have given a banner to those who fear you , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah .
so that your beloved may be delivered , save with your right hand , and answer us .
God has spoken from his sanctuary : " I will triumph . I will divide Shechem , and measure out the valley of Succoth .
Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine . Ephraim also is the defense of my head . Judah is my scepter .
Moab is my wash basin . I will throw my shoe on Edom . I shout in triumph over Philistia . "
who will bring me into the strong city ? who has led me to Edom ?
haven 't you , God , rejected us ? you don 't go out with our armies , God .
give us help against the adversary , for the help of man is vain .
through God we shall do valiantly , for it is he who will tread down our adversaries .
< < For the Chief Musician . for a stringed instrument . by David . > > Hear my cry , God . listen to my prayer .
from the end of the earth , I will call to you , when my heart is overwhelmed . lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
for you have been a refuge for me , a strong tower from the enemy .
I will dwell in your tent forever . I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings . Selah .
for you , God , have heard my vows . you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name .
you will prolong the king 's life ; his years shall be for generations .
he shall be enthroned in God 's presence forever . appoint your loving kindness and truth , that they may preserve him .
so I will sing praise to your name forever , that I may fulfill my vows daily .
< < For the Chief Musician . to Jeduthan . a Psalm by David . > > My soul rests in God alone . my salvation is from him .
he alone is my rock and my salvation , my fortress-- I will never be greatly shaken .
how long will you assault a man , would all of you throw him down , Like a leaning wall , like a tottering fence ?
they fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place . they delight in lies . they bless with their mouth , but they curse inwardly . Selah .
my soul , wait in silence for God alone , for my expectation is from him .
he alone is my rock and my salvation , my fortress . I will not be shaken .
with God is my salvation and my honor . the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God .
trust in him at all times , you people . pour out your heart before him . God is a refuge for us . Selah .
surely men of low degree are just a breath , and men of high degree are a lie . in the balances they will go up . they are together lighter than a breath .
Don 't trust in oppression . Don 't become vain in robbery . if riches increase , don 't set your heart on them .
God has spoken once ; twice I have heard this , that power belongs to God .
also to you , Lord , belongs loving kindness , for you reward every man according to his work .
< < A Psalm by David , when he was in the desert of Judah . > > God , you are my God . I will earnestly seek you . my soul thirsts for you . my flesh longs for you , in a dry and weary land , where there is no water .
so I have seen you in the sanctuary , watching your power and your glory .
because your loving kindness is better than life , my lips shall praise you .
so I will bless you while I live . I will lift up my hands in your name .
my soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food . my mouth shall praise you with joyful lips ,
when I remember you on my bed , and think about you in the night watches .
for you have been my help . I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings .
my soul stays close to you . your right hand holds me up .
but those who seek my soul , to destroy it , shall go into the lower parts of the earth .
they shall be given over to the power of the sword . they shall be Jackal food .
but the king shall rejoice in God . everyone who swears by him will praise him , for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > Hear my voice , God , in my complaint . preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked , from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil ;
who sharpen their tongue like a sword , and aim their arrows , deadly words ,
to shoot innocent men from ambushes . they shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly .
they encourage themselves in evil plans . they talk about laying snares secretly . they say , " Who will see them ? "
they plot injustice , saying , " We have made a perfect plan ! " surely man 's mind and heart are cunning .
but God will shoot at them . they will be suddenly struck down with an arrow .
their own tongues shall ruin them . all who see them will shake their heads .
all mankind shall be afraid . they shall declare the work of God , and shall wisely ponder what he has done .
the righteous shall be glad in Yahweh , and shall take refuge in him . all the upright in heart shall praise him !
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . a song . > > Praise waits for you , God , in Zion . to you shall vows be performed .
you who hear prayer , to you all men will come .
sins overwhelmed me , but you atoned for our transgressions .
blessed is one whom you choose , and cause to come near , that he may live in your courts . we will be filled with the Goodness of your house , your holy temple .
by awesome deeds of righteousness , you answer us , God of our salvation . you who are the hope of all the ends of the earth , of those who are far away on the sea ;
who by his power forms the mountains , having armed yourself with strength ;
who stills the roaring of the seas , the roaring of their waves , and the turmoil of the nations .
they also who dwell in faraway places are afraid at your wonders . you call the morning 's dawn and the evening with songs of joy .
you visit the earth , and water it . you greatly enrich it . the river of God is full of water . you provide them grain , for so you have ordained it .
you drench its furrows . you level its ridges . you soften it with showers . you bless it with a crop .
you crown the year with your bounty . your carts overflow with abundance .
the wilderness grasslands overflow . the hills are clothed with gladness .
the pastures are covered with flocks . the valleys also are clothed with grain . they shout for joy ! they also sing .
< < For the Chief Musician . a song . a Psalm . > > Make a joyful shout to God , all the earth !
sing to the glory of his name ! offer glory and praise !

all the earth will worship you , and will sing to you ; they will sing to your name . " Selah .
come , and see God 's deeds-- awesome work on behalf of the children of men .
he turned the sea into dry land . they went through the river on foot . there , we rejoiced in him .
he rules by his might forever . his eyes watch the nations . Don 't let the rebellious rise up against him . Selah .
praise our God , you peoples ! make the sound of his praise heard ,
who preserves our life among the living , and doesn 't allow our feet to be moved .
for you , God , have tested us . you have refined us , as silver is refined .
you brought us into prison . you laid a burden on our backs .
you allowed men to ride over our heads . we went through fire and through water , but you brought us to the place of abundance .
I will come into your temple with burnt offerings . I will pay my vows to you ,
which my lips promised , and my mouth spoke , when I was in distress .
I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals , with the offering of rams , I will offer bulls with goats . Selah .
come , and hear , all you who fear God . I will declare what he has done for my soul .
I cried to him with my mouth . he was extolled with my tongue .
if I cherished sin in my heart , the Lord wouldn 't have listened .
but most certainly , God has listened . he has heard the voice of my prayer .
blessed be God , who has not turned away my prayer , nor his loving kindness from me .
< < For the Chief Musician . with stringed instruments . a Psalm . a song . > > May God be merciful to us , bless us , and cause his face to shine on us . Selah .
that your way may be known on earth , and your salvation among all nations ,
let the peoples praise you , God . let all the peoples praise you .
Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy , for you will judge the peoples with equity , and govern the nations on earth . Selah .
let the peoples praise you , God . let all the peoples praise you .
the earth has yielded its increase . God , even our own God , will bless us .
God will bless us . all the ends of the earth shall fear him .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . a song . > > Let God arise ! let his enemies be scattered ! let them who hate him also flee before him .
as smoke is driven away , so drive them away . as wax melts before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
but let the righteous be glad . let them rejoice before God . yes , let them rejoice with gladness .
a father of the fatherless , and a defender of the widows , is God in his holy habitation .
God sets the lonely in families . he brings out the prisoners with singing , but the rebellious dwell in a sun @-@ scorched land .
God , when you went forth before your people , when you marched through the wilderness ... Selah .
the earth trembled . the sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai-- at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
you , God , sent a plentiful rain . you confirmed your inheritance , when it was weary .
your Congregation lived therein . you , God , prepared your Goodness for the poor .
the Lord announced the word . the ones who proclaim it are a great company .
" Kings of armies flee ! they flee ! " she who waits at home divides the spoil ,
while you sleep among the campfires , the wings of a dove sheathed with silver , her feathers with shining gold .
when the Almighty scattered kings in her , it snowed on Zalmon .
the mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains . the mountains of Bashan are rugged .
why do you look in envy , you rugged mountains , at the mountain where God chooses to reign ? yes , Yahweh will dwell there forever .
the chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands . the Lord is among them , from Sinai , into the sanctuary .
you have ascended on high . you have led away captives . you have received gifts among men , yes , among the rebellious also , that Yah God might dwell there .
blessed be the Lord , who daily bears our burdens , even the God who is our salvation . Selah .
God is to us a God of deliverance . to Yahweh , the Lord , belongs escape from death .
but God will strike through the head of his enemies , the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness .
the Lord said , " I will bring you again from Bashan , I will bring you again from the depths of the sea ;
that you may crush them , dipping your foot in blood , that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies . "
they have seen your processions , God , even the processions of my God , my King , into the sanctuary .
the singers went before , the minstrels followed after , in the midst of the ladies playing with tambourines ,
" bless God in the congregations , even the Lord in the assembly of Israel ! "
there is little Benjamin , their ruler , the princes of Judah , their council , the princes of Zebulun , and the princes of Naphtali .
your God has commanded your strength . strengthen , God , that which you have done for us .
princes shall come out of Egypt . Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God .
sing to God , you kingdoms of the earth ! sing praises to the Lord ! Selah .
to him who rides on the heaven of heavens , which are of old ; behold , he utters his voice , a mighty voice .
Ascribe strength to God ! his excellency is over Israel , his strength is in the skies .
you are awesome , God , in your sanctuaries . the God of Israel gives strength and power to his people . praise be to God !
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Lilies . " by David . > > Save me , God , for the waters have come up to my neck !
I sink in deep mire , where there is no foothold . I have come into deep waters , where the floods overflow me .
I am weary with my crying . my throat is dry . my eyes fail , looking for my God .
those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head . those who want to cut me off , being my enemies wrongfully , are mighty . I have to restore what I didn 't take away .
God , you know my foolishness . my sins aren 't hidden from you .
Don 't let those who wait for you be shamed through me , Lord Yahweh of Armies . Don 't let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me , God of Israel .
because for your sake , I have borne reproach . shame has covered my face .
I have become a stranger to my brothers , an alien to my mother 's children .
for the zeal of your house consumes me . the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me .
when I wept and I fasted , that was to my reproach .
when I made sackcloth my clothing , I became a byword to them .
those who sit in the gate talk about me . I am the song of the drunkards .
but as for me , my prayer is to you , Yahweh , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation .
deliver me out of the mire , and don 't let me sink . let me be delivered from those who hate me , and out of the deep waters .
Don 't let the flood waters overwhelm me , neither let the deep swallow me up . Don 't let the pit shut its mouth on me .
answer me , Yahweh , for your loving kindness is good . according to the multitude of your tender mercies , turn to me .
Don 't hide your face from your servant , for I am in distress . answer me speedily !
draw near to my soul , and redeem it . ransom me because of my enemies .
you know my reproach , my shame , and my dishonor . my adversaries are all before you .
reproach has broken my heart , and I am full of heaviness . I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; for comforters , but I found none .
they also gave me gall for my food . in my thirst , they gave me vinegar to drink .
let their table before them become a snare . May it become a retribution and a trap .
let their eyes be darkened , so that they can 't see . let their backs be continually bent .
pour out your indignation on them . let the fierceness of your anger overtake them .
let their habitation be desolate . let no one dwell in their tents .
for they persecute him whom you have wounded . they tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt .
charge them with crime upon crime . Don 't let them come into your righteousness .
let them be blotted out of the book of life , and not be written with the righteous .
but I am in pain and distress . let your salvation , God , protect me .
I will praise the name of God with a song , and will magnify him with Thanksgiving .
it will please Yahweh better than an ox , or a bull that has horns and hoofs .
the humble have seen it , and are glad . you who seek after God , let your heart live .
for Yahweh hears the needy , and doesn 't despise his captive people .
let heaven and earth praise him ; the seas , and everything that moves therein !
for God will save Zion , and build the cities of Judah . they shall settle there , and own it .
the children also of his servants shall inherit it . those who love his name shall dwell therein .
< < For the Chief Musician . by David . a reminder . > > hurry , God , to deliver me . come quickly to help me , Yahweh .
let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul . let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace .
let them be turned because of their shame Who say , " Aha ! Aha ! "
let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . let those who love your salvation continually say , " Let God be exalted ! "
but I am poor and needy . come to me quickly , God . you are my help and my deliverer . Yahweh , don 't delay .
in you , Yahweh , I take refuge . never let me be disappointed .
deliver me in your righteousness , and rescue me . turn your ear to me , and save me .
be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go . give the command to save me , for you are my rock and my fortress .
rescue me , my God , from the hand of the wicked , from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man .
for you are my hope , Lord Yahweh ; my confidence from my youth .
I have relied on you from the womb . you are he who took me out of my mother 's womb . I will always praise you .
I am a marvel to many , but you are my strong refuge .
my mouth shall be filled with your praise , with your honor all the day .
Don 't reject me in my old age . Don 't forsake me when my strength fails .
for my enemies talk about me . those who watch for my soul conspire together ,
saying , " God has forsaken him . pursue and take him , for no one will rescue him . "
God , don 't be far from me . my God , hurry to help me .
let my accusers be disappointed and consumed . let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me .
but I will always hope , and will add to all of your praise .
my mouth will tell about your righteousness , and of your salvation all day , though I don 't know its full measure .
I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh . I will make mention of your righteousness , even of yours alone .
God , you have taught me from my youth . until now , I have declared your wondrous works .
yes , even when I am old and gray @-@ haired , God , don 't forsake me , until I have declared your strength to the next generation , your might to everyone who is to come .
your righteousness also , God , reaches to the heavens ; you have done great things . God , who is like you ?
you , who have shown us many and bitter troubles , you will let me live . you will bring us up again from the depths of the earth .
increase my honor , and comfort me again .
I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness , my God . I sing praises to you with the Lyre , Holy One of Israel .
my lips shall shout for joy ! my soul , which you have redeemed , sings praises to you !
my tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long , for they are disappointed , and they are confounded , who want to harm me .
< < By Solomon . > > God , give the king your justice ; your righteousness to the royal son .
he will judge your people with righteousness , and your poor with justice .
the mountains shall bring prosperity to the people . the hills bring the fruit of righteousness .
he will judge the poor of the people . he will save the children of the needy , and will break the oppressor in pieces .
they shall fear you while the sun endures ; and as long as the moon , throughout all generations .
he will come down like rain on the mown grass , as showers that water the earth .
in his days , the righteous shall flourish , and abundance of peace , until the moon is no more .
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea , from the River to the ends of the earth .
those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him . his enemies shall lick the dust .
the kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute . the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts .
yes , all kings shall fall down before him . all nations shall serve him .
for he will deliver the needy when he cries ; the poor , who has no helper .
he will have pity on the poor and needy . he will save the souls of the needy .
he will redeem their soul from oppression and violence . their blood will be precious in his sight .
they shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba . men shall pray for him continually . they shall bless him all day long .
abundance of grain shall be throughout the land . its fruit sways like Lebanon . let it flourish , thriving like the grass of the field .
his name endures forever . his name continues as long as the sun . men shall be blessed by him . all nations will call him blessed .
praise be to Yahweh God , the God of Israel , who alone does marvelous deeds .
blessed be his glorious name forever ! let the whole earth be filled with his glory ! Amen and amen .
this ends the prayers by David , the son of Jesse .
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > surely God is good to Israel , to those who are pure in heart .
but as for me , my feet were almost gone . my steps had nearly slipped .
for I was envious of the arrogant , when I saw the prosperity of the wicked .
for there are no struggles in their death , but their strength is firm .
they are free from burdens of men , neither are they plagued like other men .
therefore pride is like a chain around their neck . violence covers them like a garment .
their eyes bulge with fat . their minds pass the limits of conceit .
they scoff and speak with malice . in arrogance , they threaten oppression .
they have set their mouth in the heavens . their tongue walks through the earth .
therefore their people return to them , and they drink up waters of abundance .
they say , " How does God know ? is there knowledge in the Most High ? "
behold , these are the wicked . being always at ease , they increase in riches .
surely in vain I have cleansed my heart , and washed my hands in innocence ,
for all day long have I been plagued , and punished every morning .
if I had said , " I will speak thus " ; behold , I would have betrayed the generation of your children .
when I tried to understand this , it was too painful for me ;
until I entered God 's sanctuary , and considered their latter end .
surely you set them in slippery places . you throw them down to destruction .
how they are suddenly destroyed ! they are completely swept away with terrors .
as a dream when one wakes up , so , Lord , when you awake , you will despise their fantasies .
for my soul was grieved . I was embittered in my heart .
I was so senseless and ignorant . I was a brute beast before you .
nevertheless , I am continually with you . you have held my right hand .
you will guide me with your counsel , and afterward receive me to glory .
whom do I have in heaven ? there is no one on earth whom I desire besides you .
my flesh and my heart fails , but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever .
for , behold , those who are far from you shall perish . you have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you .
but it is good for me to come close to God . I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge , that I may tell of all your works .
< < A contemplation by Asaph . > > God , why have you rejected us forever ? why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture ?
remember your Congregation , which you purchased of old , which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance ; Mount Zion , in which you have lived .
lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins , all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary .
your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly . they have set up their standards as signs .
they behaved like men wielding axes , cutting through a thicket of trees .
now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers .
they have burned your sanctuary to the ground . they have profaned the dwelling place of your Name .
they said in their heart , " We will crush them completely . " they have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped .
we see no miraculous signs . there is no longer any prophet , neither is there among us anyone who knows how long .
how long , God , shall the adversary reproach ? shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever ?
why do you draw back your hand , even your right hand ? take it out of your pocket and consume them !
yet God is my King of old , working salvation in the midst of the earth .
you divided the sea by your strength . you broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters .
you broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces . you gave him as food to people and desert creatures .
you opened up spring and stream . you dried up mighty rivers .
the day is yours , the night is also yours . you have prepared the light and the sun .
you have set all the boundaries of the earth . you have made summer and winter .
remember this , that the enemy has mocked you , Yahweh . foolish people have blasphemed your name .
Don 't deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts . Don 't forget the life of your poor forever .
honor your Covenant , for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth .
Don 't let the oppressed return ashamed . let the poor and needy praise your name .
Don 't forget the voice of your adversaries . the tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a Psalm by Asaph . a song . > > We give thanks to you , God . we give thanks , for your Name is near . men tell about your wondrous works .
when I choose the appointed time , I will judge blamelessly .
the earth and all its inhabitants quake . I firmly hold its pillars . Selah .
I said to the arrogant , " Don 't boast ! " I said to the wicked , " Don 't lift up the Horn .
Don 't lift up your Horn on high . Don 't speak with a stiff neck . "
for neither from the east , nor from the west , nor yet from the south , comes exaltation .
but God is the judge . he puts down one , and lifts up another .
for in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup , full of foaming wine mixed with spices . he pours it out . indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs .
but I will declare this forever : I will sing praises to the God of Jacob .
I will cut off all the horns of the wicked , but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up .
< < For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a Psalm by Asaph . a song . > > In Judah , God is known . his name is great in Israel .
his tabernacle is also in Salem ; His dwelling place in Zion .
there he broke the flaming arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the weapons of war . Selah .
glorious are you , and excellent , more than mountains of game .
valiant men lie plundered , they have slept their last sleep . none of the men of war can lift their hands .
at your rebuke , God of Jacob , both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep .
you , even you , are to be feared . who can stand in your sight when you are angry ?
you pronounced judgment from heaven . the earth feared , and was silent ,
when God arose to judgment , to save all the afflicted ones of the earth . Selah .
surely the wrath of man praises you . the survivors of your wrath are restrained .
make vows to Yahweh your God , and fulfill them ! let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared .
he will cut off the spirit of princes . he is feared by the kings of the earth .
< < For the Chief Musician . to Jeduthun . a Psalm by Asaph . > > My cry goes to God ! indeed , I cry to God for help , and for him to listen to me .
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord . my hand was stretched out in the night , and didn 't get tired . my soul refused to be comforted .
I remember God , and I groan . I complain , and my spirit is overwhelmed . Selah .
you hold my eyelids open . I am so troubled that I can 't speak .
I have considered the days of old , the years of ancient times .
I remember my song in the night . I consider in my own heart ; my spirit diligently inquires :
" will the Lord reject us forever ? will he be favorable no more ?
has his loving kindness vanished forever ? does his promise fail for generations ?
has God forgotten to be gracious ? has he , in anger , withheld his compassion ? " Selah .
then I thought , " I will appeal to this : the years of the right hand of the Most High . "
I will remember Yah 's deeds ; for I will remember your wonders of old .
I will also meditate on all your work , and consider your doings .
your way , God , is in the sanctuary . what god is great like God ?
you are the God who does wonders . you have made your strength known among the peoples .
you have redeemed your people with your arm , the sons of Jacob and Joseph . Selah .
the waters saw you , God . the waters saw you , and they writhed . the depths also convulsed .
the clouds poured out water . the skies resounded with Thunder . your arrows also flashed around .
the voice of your Thunder was in the whirlwind . the lightnings lit up the world . the earth trembled and shook .
your way was through the sea ; your paths through the great waters . your footsteps were not known .
you led your people like a flock , by the hand of Moses and Aaron .
< < A contemplation by Asaph . > > Hear my teaching , my people . turn your ears to the words of my mouth .
I will open my mouth in a parable . I will utter dark sayings of old ,
which we have heard and known , and our fathers have told us .
we will not hide them from their children , telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh , his strength , and his wondrous works that he has done .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a teaching in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children ;
that the generation to come might know , even the children who should be born ; who should arise and tell their children ,
that they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God , but keep his commandments ,
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that didn 't make their hearts loyal , whose spirit was not steadfast with God .
the children of Ephraim , being armed and carrying bows , turned back in the day of battle .
they didn 't keep God 's Covenant , and refused to walk in his law .
they forgot his doings , his wondrous works that he had shown them .
he did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers , in the land of Egypt , in the field of Zoan .
he split the sea , and caused them to pass through . he made the waters stand as a heap .
in the daytime he also led them with a cloud , and all night with a light of fire .
he split rocks in the wilderness , and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths .
he brought streams also out of the rock , and caused waters to run down like rivers .
yet they still went on to sin against him , to rebel against the Most High in the desert .
they tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire .
yes , they spoke against God . they said , " Can God prepare a table in the wilderness ?
behold , he struck the rock , so that waters gushed out , and streams overflowed . can he give bread also ? will he provide flesh for his people ? "
therefore Yahweh heard , and was angry . a fire was kindled against Jacob , anger also went up against Israel ,
because they didn 't believe in God , and didn 't trust in his salvation .
yet he commanded the skies above , and opened the doors of heaven .
he rained down manna on them to eat , and gave them food from the sky .
man ate the bread of angels . he sent them food to the full .
he caused the east wind to blow in the sky . by his power he guided the south wind .
he rained also flesh on them as the dust ; winged birds as the sand of the seas .
he let them fall in the midst of their camp , around their habitations .
so they ate , and were well filled . he gave them their own desire .
they didn 't turn from their cravings . their food was yet in their mouths ,
when the anger of God went up against them , killed some of their fattest , and struck down the young men of Israel .
for all this they still sinned , and didn 't believe in his wondrous works .
therefore he consumed their days in vanity , and their years in terror .
when he killed them , then they inquired after him . they returned and sought God earnestly .
they remembered that God was their rock , the Most High God , their redeemer .
but they flattered him with their mouth , and lied to him with their tongue .
for their heart was not right with him , neither were they faithful in his Covenant .
but he , being merciful , forgave iniquity , and didn 't destroy them . yes , many times he turned his anger away , and didn 't stir up all his wrath .
he remembered that they were but flesh , a wind that passes away , and doesn 't come again .
how often they rebelled against him in the wilderness , and grieved him in the desert !
they turned again and tempted God , and provoked the Holy One of Israel .
they didn 't remember his hand , nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary ;
how he set his signs in Egypt , his wonders in the field of Zoan ,
he turned their rivers into blood , and their streams , so that they could not drink .
he sent among them swarms of flies , which devoured them ; and frogs , which destroyed them .
he gave also their increase to the caterpillar , and their labor to the locust .
he destroyed their vines with hail , their sycamore fig trees with Frost .
he gave over their livestock also to the hail , and their flocks to hot thunderbolts .
he threw on them the fierceness of his anger , wrath , indignation , and trouble , and a band of angels of evil .
he made a path for his anger . he didn 't spare their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pestilence ,
and struck all the firstborn in Egypt , the chief of their strength in the tents of ham .
but he led forth his own people like sheep , and guided them in the wilderness like a flock .
he led them safely , so that they weren 't afraid , but the sea overwhelmed their enemies .
he brought them to the border of his sanctuary , to this mountain , which his right hand had taken .
he also drove out the nations before them , allotted them for an inheritance by line , and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents .
yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God , and didn 't keep his testimonies ;
but turned back , and dealt treacherously like their fathers . they were turned aside like a deceitful bow .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images .
when God heard this , he was angry , and greatly abhorred Israel ;
so that he forsook the tent of Shiloh , the tent which he placed among men ;
and delivered his strength into captivity , his glory into the adversary 's hand .
he also gave his people over to the sword , and was angry with his inheritance .
fire devoured their young men . their virgins had no wedding song .
their priests fell by the sword , and their widows couldn 't weep .
then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep , like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine .
he struck his adversaries backward . he put them to a perpetual reproach .
moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph , and didn 't choose the tribe of Ephraim ,
but chose the tribe of Judah , Mount Zion which he loved .
he built his sanctuary like the heights , like the earth which he has established forever .
he also chose David his servant , and took him from the sheepfolds ;
from following the ewes that have their young , he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob , his people , and Israel , his inheritance .
so he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart , and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands .
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > God , the nations have come into your inheritance . they have defiled your holy temple . they have laid Jerusalem in heaps .
they have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky , the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth .
their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem . there was no one to bury them .
we have become a reproach to our neighbors , a scoffing and derision to those who are around us .
how long , Yahweh ? will you be angry forever ? will your jealousy burn like fire ?
pour out your wrath on the nations that don 't know you ; on the kingdoms that don 't call on your name ;
for they have devoured Jacob , and destroyed his homeland .
Don 't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us . let your tender mercies speedily meet us , for we are in desperate need .
help us , God of our salvation , for the glory of your name . deliver us , and forgive our sins , for your name 's sake .
why should the nations say , " Where is their God ? " let it be known among the nations , before our eyes , that vengeance for your servants ' blood is being poured out .
let the sighing of the prisoner come before you . according to the greatness of your power , preserve those who are sentenced to death .
pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you , Lord .
so we , your people and sheep of your pasture , will give you thanks forever . we will praise you forever , to all generations .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " The Lilies of the Covenant . " a Psalm by Asaph . > > Hear us , shepherd of Israel , you who lead Joseph like a flock , you who sit above the cherubim , shine forth .
before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh , stir up your might ! come to save us !
turn us again , God . cause your face to shine , and we will be saved .
Yahweh God of Armies , How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people ?
you have fed them with the bread of tears , and given them tears to drink in large measure .
you make us a source of contention to our neighbors . our enemies laugh among themselves .
turn us again , God of Armies . cause your face to shine , and we will be saved .
you brought a vine out of Egypt . you drove out the nations , and planted it .
you cleared the ground for it . it took deep root , and filled the land .
the mountains were covered with its shadow . its boughs were like God 's cedars .
it sent out its branches to the sea , Its shoots to the River .
why have you broken down its walls , so that all those who pass by the way pluck it ?
the Boar out of the wood ravages it . the wild animals of the field feed on it .
turn again , we beg you , God of Armies . look down from heaven , and see , and visit this vine ,
the stock which your right hand planted , the branch that you made strong for yourself .
it 's burned with fire . it 's cut down . they perish at your rebuke .
let your hand be on the man of your right hand , on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself .
so we will not turn away from you . revive us , and we will call on your name .
turn us again , Yahweh God of Armies . cause your face to shine , and we will be saved .
< < For the Chief Musician . on an instrument of Gath . by Asaph . > > sing aloud to God , our strength ! make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob !
raise a song , and bring here the tambourine , the pleasant Lyre with the harp .
for it is a statute for Israel , an ordinance of the God of Jacob .
he appointed it in Joseph for a testimony , when he went out over the land of Egypt , I heard a language that I didn 't know .
" I removed his shoulder from the burden . his hands were freed from the basket .
you called in trouble , and I delivered you . I answered you in the secret place of Thunder . I tested you at the waters of Meribah . " Selah .
" hear , my people , and I will testify to you , Israel , if you would listen to me !
there shall be no strange god in you , neither shall you worship any foreign god .
I am Yahweh , your God , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt . open your mouth wide , and I will fill it .
but my people didn 't listen to my voice . Israel desired none of me .
so I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts , that they might walk in their own counsels .
Oh that my people would listen to me , that Israel would walk in my ways !
I would soon subdue their enemies , and turn my hand against their adversaries .
the haters of Yahweh would cringe before him , and their punishment would last forever .
but he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat . I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock . "
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > God presides in the great assembly . he judges among the gods .
" how long will you judge unjustly , and show partiality to the wicked ? " Selah .
" defend the weak , the poor , and the fatherless . maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed .
rescue the weak and needy . deliver them out of the hand of the wicked . "
they don 't know , neither do they understand . they walk back and forth in darkness . all the foundations of the earth are shaken .
I said , " You are gods , all of you are sons of the Most High .
nevertheless you shall die like men , and fall like one of the rulers . "
arise , God , judge the earth , for you inherit all of the nations .
< < A song . a Psalm by Asaph . > > God , don 't keep silent . Don 't keep silent , and don 't be still , God .
for , behold , your enemies are stirred up . those who hate you have lifted up their heads .
they conspire with cunning against your people . they plot against your cherished ones .
" come , " they say , " and let 's destroy them as a nation , that the name of Israel may be remembered no more . "
for they have conspired together with one mind . they form an alliance against you .
the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites ; Moab , and the Hagrites ;
Gebal , Ammon , and Amalek ; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre ;
Assyria also is joined with them . they have helped the children of lot . Selah .
do to them as you did to Midian , as to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the river Kishon ;
who perished at Endor , who became as Dung for the earth .
make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb ; yes , all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna ;
who said , " Let us take possession of God 's pasturelands . "
my God , make them like tumbleweed ; like chaff before the wind .
as the fire that burns the forest , as the flame that sets the mountains on fire ,
so pursue them with your tempest , and terrify them with your storm .
fill their faces with confusion , that they may seek your name , Yahweh .
let them be disappointed and dismayed forever . yes , let them be confounded and perish ;
that they may know that you alone , whose name is Yahweh , are the Most High over all the earth .
< < For the Chief Musician . on an instrument of Gath . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > How lovely are your dwellings , Yahweh of Armies !
my soul longs , and even faints for the courts of Yahweh . my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God .
yes , the sparrow has found a home , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may have her young , near your altars , Yahweh of Armies , my King , and my God .
blessed are those who dwell in your house . they are always praising you . Selah .
blessed are those whose strength is in you ; who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage .
passing through the valley of Weeping , they make it a place of springs . yes , the autumn rain covers it with blessings .
they go from strength to strength . everyone of them appears before God in Zion .
Yahweh , God of Armies , hear my prayer . listen , God of Jacob . Selah .
behold , God our shield , look at the face of your anointed .
for a day in your courts is better than a thousand . I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
for Yahweh God is a sun and a shield . Yahweh will give grace and glory . he Withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly .
Yahweh of Armies , blessed is the man who trusts in you .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Yahweh , you have been favorable to your land . you have restored the fortunes of Jacob .
you have forgiven the iniquity of your people . you have covered all their sin . Selah .
you have taken away all your wrath . you have turned from the fierceness of your anger .
turn us , God of our salvation , and cause your indignation toward us to cease .
will you be angry with us forever ? will you draw out your anger to all generations ?
won 't you revive us again , that your people may rejoice in you ?
show us your loving kindness , Yahweh . grant us your salvation .
I will hear what God , Yahweh , will speak , for he will speak peace to his people , his saints ; but let them not turn again to Folly .
surely his salvation is near those who fear him , that glory may dwell in our land .
mercy and truth meet together . Righteousness and peace have kissed each other .
truth springs out of the earth . Righteousness has looked down from heaven .
yes , Yahweh will give that which is good . our land will yield its increase .
Righteousness goes before him , And prepares the way for his steps .
< < A Prayer by David . > > Hear , Yahweh , and answer me , for I am poor and needy .
preserve my soul , for I am godly . you , my God , save your servant who trusts in you .
be merciful to me , Lord , for I call to you all day long .
bring joy to the soul of your servant , for to you , Lord , do I lift up my soul .
for you , Lord , are good , and ready to forgive ; abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you .
hear , Yahweh , my prayer . listen to the voice of my petitions .
in the day of my trouble I will call on you , for you will answer me .
there is no one like you among the gods , Lord , nor any deeds like your deeds .
all nations you have made will come and worship before you , Lord . they shall glorify your name .
for you are great , and do wondrous things . you are God alone .
teach me your way , Yahweh . I will walk in your truth . make my heart undivided to fear your name .
I will praise you , Lord my God , with my whole heart . I will glorify your name forevermore .
for your loving kindness is great toward me . you have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol .
God , the proud have risen up against me . a company of violent men have sought after my soul , and they don 't hold regard for you before them .
but you , Lord , are a merciful and gracious God , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness and truth .
turn to me , and have mercy on me ! give your strength to your servant . save the son of your handmaid .
show me a sign of your Goodness , that those who hate me may see it , and be shamed , because you , Yahweh , have helped me , and comforted me .
< < A Psalm by the sons of Korah ; a Song . > > His foundation is in the holy mountains .
Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob .
glorious things are spoken about you , city of God . Selah .
I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me . behold , Philistia , Tyre , and also Ethiopia : " this one was born there . "
yes , of Zion it will be said , " This one and that one was born in her " ; the Most High himself will establish her .
Yahweh will count , when he writes up the peoples , " This one was born there . " Selah .
those who sing as well as those who dance say , " All my springs are in you . "
< < A Song . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . for the Chief Musician . to the tune of " The suffering of affliction . " a contemplation by Heman , the Ezrahite . > > Yahweh , the God of my salvation , I have cried day and night before you .
let my prayer enter into your presence . turn your ear to my cry .
for my soul is full of troubles . my life draws near to Sheol .
I am counted among those who go down into the pit . I am like a man who has no help ,
set apart among the dead , like the slain who lie in the grave , whom you remember no more . they are cut off from your hand .
you have laid me in the lowest pit , in the darkest depths .
your wrath lies heavily on me . you have afflicted me with all your waves . Selah .
you have taken my friends from me . you have made me an abomination to them . I am confined , and I can 't escape .
my eyes are dim from grief . I have called on you daily , Yahweh . I have spread out my hands to you .
do you show wonders to the dead ? do the dead rise up and praise you ? Selah .
is your loving kindness declared in the grave ? or your faithfulness in Destruction ?
are your wonders made known in the dark ? or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness ?
but to you , Yahweh , I have cried . in the morning , my prayer comes before you .
Yahweh , why do you reject my soul ? why do you hide your face from me ?
I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up . while I suffer your terrors , I am distracted .
your fierce wrath has gone over me . your terrors have cut me off .
they came around me like water all day long . they completely engulfed me .
you have put lover and friend far from me , and my friends into darkness .
< < A contemplation by Ethan , the Ezrahite . > > I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever . with my mouth , I will make known your faithfulness to all generations .
I indeed declare , " Love stands firm forever . you established the heavens . your faithfulness is in them . "
" I have made a Covenant with my chosen one , I have sworn to David , my servant ,
'i will establish your seed forever , and build up your throne to all generations . ' " Selah .
the heavens will praise your wonders , Yahweh ; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones .
for who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh ? who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh ,
a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones , to be feared above all those who are around him ?
Yahweh , God of Armies , who is a mighty one , like you ? Yah , your faithfulness is around you .
you rule the pride of the sea . when its waves rise up , you calm them .
you have broken Rahab in pieces , like one of the slain . you have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm .
the heavens are yours . the earth also is yours ; the world and its fullness . you have founded them .
the north and the south , you have created them . Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name .
you have a mighty arm . your hand is strong , and your right hand is exalted .
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne . loving kindness and truth go before your face .
blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you . they walk in the light of your presence , Yahweh .
in your name they rejoice all day . in your righteousness , they are exalted .
for you are the glory of their strength . in your favor , our Horn will be exalted .
for our shield belongs to Yahweh ; our king to the Holy One of Israel .
then you spoke in vision to your saints , and said , " I have bestowed strength on the warrior . I have exalted a young man from the people .
I have found David , my servant . I have anointed him with my holy oil ,
with whom my hand shall be established . my arm will also strengthen him .
no enemy will tax him . no wicked man will oppress him .
I will beat down his adversaries before him , and strike those who hate him .
but my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him . in my name , his Horn will be exalted .
I will set his hand also on the sea , and his right hand on the rivers .
he will call to me , ' You are my Father , my God , and the rock of my salvation ! '
I will also appoint him my firstborn , the highest of the kings of the earth .
I will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore . my Covenant will stand firm with him .
I will also make his seed endure forever , and his throne as the days of heaven .
if his children forsake my law , and don 't walk in my ordinances ;
if they break my statutes , and don 't keep my commandments ;
then I will punish their sin with the rod , and their iniquity with stripes .
but I will not completely take my loving kindness from him , nor allow my faithfulness to fail .
I will not break my Covenant , nor alter what my lips have uttered .
once have I sworn by my holiness , I will not lie to David .
his seed will endure forever , his throne like the sun before me .
it will be established forever like the moon , the faithful witness in the sky . " Selah .
but you have rejected and spurned . you have been angry with your anointed .
you have renounced the Covenant of your servant . you have defiled his crown in the dust .
you have broken down all his hedges . you have brought his strongholds to ruin .
all who pass by the way rob him . he has become a reproach to his neighbors .
yes , you turn back the edge of his sword , and haven 't supported him in battle .
you have ended his splendor , and thrown his throne down to the ground .
you have shortened the days of his youth . you have covered him with shame . Selah .
how long , Yahweh ? will you hide yourself forever ? will your wrath burn like fire ?
remember how short my time is ! for what vanity have you created all the children of men !
what man is he who shall live and not see death , who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol ? Selah .
Lord , where are your former loving kindnesses , which you swore to David in your faithfulness ?
< < A Prayer by Moses , the man of GodThe Hebrew word rendered " God " is " Elohim .. " > > Lord , you have been our dwelling place for all generations .
before the mountains were brought forth , before you had formed the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting , you are God .
you turn man to destruction , saying , " Return , you children of men . "
for a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past , like a watch in the night .
you sweep them away as they sleep . in the morning they sprout like new grass .
in the morning it sprouts and springs up . by evening , it is withered and dry .
for we are consumed in your anger . we are troubled in your wrath .
you have set our iniquities before you , our secret sins in the light of your presence .
for all our days have passed away in your wrath . we bring our years to an end as a sigh .
the days of our years are seventy , or even by reason of strength eighty years ; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow , for it passes quickly , and we fly away .
who knows the power of your anger , your wrath according to the fear that is due to you ?
so teach us to number our days , that we may gain a heart of wisdom .
relent , Yahweh ! how long ? have compassion on your servants !
satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness , that we may rejoice and be glad all our days .
make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us , for as many years as we have seen evil .
let your work appear to your servants ; your glory to their children .
let the favor of the Lord our God be on us ; establish the work of our hands for us ; yes , establish the work of our hands .
he who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty .
I will say of Yahweh , " He is my refuge and my fortress ; my God , in whom I trust . "
for he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler , and from the deadly pestilence .
he will cover you with his feathers . under his wings you will take refuge . his faithfulness is your shield and rampart .
you shall not be afraid of the terror by night , nor of the arrow that flies by day ;
a thousand may fall at your side , and ten thousand at your right hand ; but it will not come near you .
you will only look with your eyes , and see the recompense of the wicked .
because you have made Yahweh your refuge , and the Most High your dwelling place ,
no evil shall happen to you , neither shall any plague come near your dwelling .
for he will put his angels in charge of you , to guard you in all your ways .
they will bear you up in their hands , so that you won 't dash your foot against a stone .
you will tread on the lion and Cobra . you will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot .
" because he has set his love on me , therefore I will deliver him . I will set him on high , because he has known my name .
he will call on me , and I will answer him . I will be with him in trouble . I will deliver him , and honor him .
I will satisfy him with long life , and show him my salvation . "
for you , Yahweh , have made me glad through your work . I will triumph in the works of your hands .
how great are your works , Yahweh ! your thoughts are very deep .
a senseless man doesn 't know , neither does a fool understand this :
though the wicked spring up as the grass , and all the evildoers flourish , they will be destroyed forever .
but you , Yahweh , are on high forevermore .
for , behold , your enemies , Yahweh , for , behold , your enemies shall perish . all the evildoers will be scattered .
but you have exalted my Horn like that of the wild ox . I am anointed with fresh oil .
my eye has also seen my enemies . my ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me .
the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree . he will grow like a cedar in Lebanon .
they are planted in Yahweh 's house . they will flourish in our God 's courts .
they will still bring forth fruit in old age . they will be full of SAP and green ,
to show that Yahweh is upright . he is my rock , and there is no unrighteousness in him .
Yahweh reigns ! he is clothed with majesty ! Yahweh is armed with strength . the world also is established . it can 't be moved .
your throne is established from long ago . you are from everlasting .
the floods have lifted up , Yahweh , the floods have lifted up their voice . the floods lift up their waves .
above the voices of many waters , the mighty breakers of the sea , Yahweh on high is mighty .
your statutes stand firm . Holiness adorns your house , Yahweh , forevermore .
rise up , you judge of the earth . pay back the proud what they deserve .
Yahweh , how long will the wicked , how long will the wicked triumph ?
they pour out arrogant words . all the evildoers boast .
they break your people in pieces , Yahweh , and afflict your heritage .
they kill the widow and the alien , and murder the fatherless .
consider , you senseless among the people ; you fools , when will you be wise ?
he who implanted the ear , won 't he hear ? he who formed the eye , won 't he see ?
he who disciplines the nations , won 't he punish ? he who teaches man knows .
Yahweh knows the thoughts of man , that they are futile .
blessed is the man whom you discipline , Yah , and teach out of your law ;
that you may give him rest from the days of adversity , until the pit is dug for the wicked .
for Yahweh won 't reject his people , neither will he forsake his inheritance .
for judgment will return to righteousness . all the upright in heart shall follow it .
who will rise up for me against the wicked ? who will stand up for me against the evildoers ?
unless Yahweh had been my help , my soul would have soon lived in silence .
when I said , " My foot is slipping ! " your loving kindness , Yahweh , held me up .
in the multitude of my thoughts within me , your comforts delight my soul .
shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you , which brings about mischief by statute ?
they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous , and condemn the innocent blood .
but Yahweh has been my high tower , my God , the rock of my refuge .
he has brought on them their own iniquity , and will cut them off in their own wickedness . Yahweh , our God , will cut them off .
Oh come , let 's sing to Yahweh . let 's shout aloud to the rock of our salvation !
let 's come before his presence with Thanksgiving . let 's extol him with songs !
in his hand are the deep places of the earth . the heights of the mountains are also his .
the sea is his , and he made it . his hands formed the dry land .
Oh come , let 's worship and bow down . let 's kneel before Yahweh , our Maker ,
for he is our God . we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep in his care . today , oh that you would hear his voice !
Don 't harden your heart , as at Meribah , as in the day of Massah in the wilderness ,
when your fathers tempted me , tested me , and saw my work .
forty long years I was grieved with that generation , and said , " It is a people that errs in their heart . they have not known my ways . "
therefore I swore in my wrath , " They won 't enter into my rest . "
sing to Yahweh a new song ! sing to Yahweh , all the earth .
sing to Yahweh ! bless his name ! proclaim his salvation from day to day !
declare his glory among the nations , his marvelous works among all the peoples .
for great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised ! he is to be feared above all gods .
for all the gods of the peoples are idols , but Yahweh made the heavens .
honor and majesty are before him . strength and beauty are in his sanctuary .
Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name . bring an offering , and come into his courts .
worship Yahweh in holy array . Tremble before him , all the earth .
say among the nations , " Yahweh reigns . " the world is also established . it can 't be moved . he will judge the peoples with equity .
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice . let the sea roar , and its fullness !
Yahweh reigns ! let the earth rejoice ! let the multitude of islands be glad !
clouds and darkness are around him . Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne .
a fire goes before him , and burns up his adversaries on every side .
his lightning lights up the world . the earth sees , and trembles .
the mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh , at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth .
the heavens declare his righteousness . all the peoples have seen his glory .
let all them be shamed who serve engraved images , who boast in their idols . worship him , all you gods !
Zion heard and was glad . the daughters of Judah rejoiced , because of your judgments , Yahweh .
for you , Yahweh , are most high above all the earth . you are exalted far above all gods .
you who love Yahweh , hate evil . he preserves the souls of his saints . he delivers them out of the hand of the wicked .
light is sown for the righteous , and gladness for the upright in heart .
be glad in Yahweh , you righteous people ! give thanks to his holy Name .
< < A Psalm . > > sing to Yahweh a new song , for he has done marvelous things ! his right hand , and his holy arm , have worked salvation for him .
Yahweh has made known his salvation . he has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations .
he has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel . all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
make a joyful noise to Yahweh , all the earth ! burst out and sing for joy , yes , sing praises !
sing praises to Yahweh with the harp , with the harp and the voice of melody .
with trumpets and sound of the ram 's Horn , make a joyful noise before the King , Yahweh .
let the sea roar with its fullness ; the world , and those who dwell therein .
let the rivers clap their hands . let the mountains sing for joy together .
Yahweh reigns ! let the peoples tremble . he sits enthroned among the cherubim . let the earth be moved .
Yahweh is great in Zion . he is high above all the peoples .
let them praise your great and awesome name . he is Holy !
the King 's strength also loves justice . you do establish equity . you execute justice and righteousness in Jacob .
Exalt Yahweh our God . worship at his footstool . he is Holy !
Moses and Aaron were among his priests , Samuel among those who call on his name ; they called on Yahweh , and he answered them .
he spoke to them in the pillar of cloud . they kept his testimonies , the statute that he gave them .
you answered them , Yahweh our God . you are a God who forgave them , although you took vengeance for their doings .
Exalt Yahweh , our God . worship at his holy hill , for Yahweh , our God , is holy !
< < A Psalm of Thanksgiving . > > shout for joy to Yahweh , all you lands !
serve Yahweh with gladness . come before his presence with singing .
know that Yahweh , he is God . it is he who has made us , and we are his . we are his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
for Yahweh is good . his loving kindness endures forever , his faithfulness to all generations .
< < A Psalm by David . > > I will sing of loving kindness and justice . to you , Yahweh , I will sing praises .
I will be careful to live a blameless life . when will you come to me ? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart .
I will set no vile thing before my eyes . I hate the deeds of Faithless men . they will not cling to me .
a perverse heart will be far from me . I will have nothing to do with evil .
I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor . I won 't tolerate one who is haughty and conceited .
my eyes will be on the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with me . he who walks in a perfect way , he will serve me .
he who practices deceit won 't dwell within my house . he who speaks falsehood won 't be established before my eyes .
morning by morning , I will destroy all the wicked of the land ; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh 's city .
< < A Prayer of the afflicted , when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before Yahweh . > > Hear my prayer , Yahweh ! let my cry come to you .
Don 't hide your face from me in the day of my distress . turn your ear to me . answer me quickly in the day when I call .
for my days consume away like smoke . my bones are burned as a torch .
my heart is blighted like grass , and withered , for I forget to eat my bread .
by reason of the voice of my groaning , my bones stick to my skin .
I am like a pelican of the wilderness . I have become as an owl of the waste places .
I watch , and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop .
my enemies reproach me all day . those who are mad at me use my name as a curse .
for I have eaten ashes like bread , and mixed my drink with tears ,
my days are like a long shadow . I have withered like grass .
but you , Yahweh , will remain forever ; your renown endures to all generations .
you will arise and have mercy on Zion ; for it is time to have pity on her . yes , the set time has come .
for your servants take pleasure in her stones , and have pity on her dust .
so the nations will fear the name of Yahweh ; all the kings of the earth your glory .
for Yahweh has built up Zion . he has appeared in his glory .
he has responded to the prayer of the destitute , and has not despised their prayer .
this will be written for the generation to come . a people which will be created will praise Yah .
for he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary . from heaven , Yahweh saw the earth ;
to hear the groans of the prisoner ; to free those who are condemned to death ;
that men may declare the name of Yahweh in Zion , and his praise in Jerusalem ;
he weakened my strength along the course . he shortened my days .
I said , " My God , don 't take me away in the midst of my days . your years are throughout all generations .
of old , you laid the foundation of the earth . the heavens are the work of your hands .
they will perish , but you will endure . yes , all of them will wear out like a garment . you will change them like a cloak , and they will be changed .
but you are the same . your years will have no end .
the children of your servants will continue . their seed will be established before you . "
< < By David . > > Praise Yahweh , my soul ! all that is within me , praise his holy name !
praise Yahweh , my soul , and don 't forget all his benefits ;
who forgives all your sins ; who heals all your diseases ;
who redeems your life from destruction ; who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies ;
who satisfies your desire with good things , so that your youth is renewed like the eagle 's .
Yahweh executes righteous acts , and justice for all who are oppressed .
he made known his ways to Moses , his deeds to the children of Israel .
Yahweh is merciful and gracious , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness .
he will not always accuse ; neither will he stay angry forever .
he has not dealt with us according to our sins , nor repaid us for our iniquities .
for as the heavens are high above the earth , so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him .
as far as the east is from the west , so far has he removed our transgressions from us .
like a father has compassion on his children , so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him .
for he knows how we are made . he remembers that we are dust .
as for man , his days are like grass . as a flower of the field , so he flourishes .
for the wind passes over it , and it is gone . its place remembers it no more .
but Yahweh 's loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him , his righteousness to children 's children ;
Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens . his kingdom rules over all .
praise Yahweh , you angels of his , who are mighty in strength , who fulfill his word , obeying the voice of his word .
praise Yahweh , all you armies of his , you servants of his , who do his pleasure .
praise Yahweh , all you works of his , in all places of his dominion . praise Yahweh , my soul !
bless Yahweh , my soul . Yahweh , my God , you are very great . you are clothed with honor and majesty .
he covers himself with light as with a garment . he stretches out the heavens like a curtain .
he lays the beams of his rooms in the waters . he makes the clouds his chariot . he walks on the wings of the wind .
he makes his messengers winds ; his servants flames of fire .
he laid the foundations of the earth , that it should not be moved forever .
you covered it with the deep as with a cloak . the waters stood above the mountains .
at your rebuke they fled . at the voice of your Thunder they hurried away .
the mountains rose , the valleys sank down , to the place which you had assigned to them .
you have set a boundary that they may not pass over ; that they don 't turn again to cover the earth .
he sends forth springs into the valleys . they run among the mountains .
they give drink to every animal of the field . the wild donkeys quench their thirst .
the birds of the sky nest by them . they sing among the branches .
he waters the mountains from his rooms . the earth is filled with the fruit of your works .
he causes the grass to grow for the livestock , and plants for man to cultivate , that he may bring forth food out of the earth :
wine that makes glad the heart of man , oil to make his face to shine , and bread that strengthens man 's heart .
Yahweh 's trees are well watered , the cedars of Lebanon , which he has planted ;
where the birds make their nests . the stork makes its home in the fir trees .
the high mountains are for the wild goats . the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers .
he appointed the moon for seasons . the sun knows when to set .
you make darkness , and it is night , in which all the animals of the forest prowl .
the young lions roar after their prey , and seek their food from God .
the sun rises , and they steal away , and lay down in their dens .
man goes forth to his work , to his labor until the evening .
Yahweh , how many are your works ! in wisdom have you made them all . the earth is full of your riches .
there is the sea , great and wide , in which are innumerable living things , both small and large animals .
there the ships go , and leviathan , whom you formed to play there .
these all wait for you , that you may give them their food in due season .
you give to them ; they gather . you open your hand ; they are satisfied with good .
you hide your face : they are troubled ; you take away their breath : they die , and return to the dust .
you send forth your Spirit : they are created . you renew the face of the ground .
let the glory of Yahweh endure forever . let Yahweh rejoice in his works .
he looks at the earth , and it trembles . he touches the mountains , and they smoke .
I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live . I will sing praise to my God while I have any being .
let sinners be consumed out of the earth . let the wicked be no more . bless Yahweh , my soul . praise Yah !
give thanks to Yahweh ! call on his name ! make his doings known among the peoples .
sing to him , sing praises to him ! tell of all his marvelous works .
glory in his holy name . let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice .
seek Yahweh and his strength . seek his face forever more .
remember his marvelous works that he has done ; his wonders , and the judgments of his mouth ,
he is Yahweh , our God . his judgments are in all the earth .
he has remembered his Covenant forever , the word which he commanded to a thousand generations ,
and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute ; to Israel for an everlasting Covenant ,
when they were but a few men in number , yes , very few , and foreigners in it .
they went about from nation to nation , from one kingdom to another people .
he allowed no one to do them wrong . yes , he reproved kings for their sakes ,
" Don 't touch my anointed ones ! do my prophets no harm ! "
he called for a famine on the land . he destroyed the food supplies .
he sent a man before them . Joseph was sold for a slave .
they bruised his feet with shackles . his neck was locked in irons ,
until the time that his word happened , and Yahweh 's word proved him true .
the king sent and freed him ; even the ruler of peoples , and let him go free .
he made him lord of his house , and ruler of all of his possessions ;
to discipline his princes at his pleasure , and to teach his elders wisdom .
Israel also came into Egypt . Jacob lived in the land of ham .
he increased his people greatly , and made them stronger than their adversaries .
he turned their heart to hate his people , to conspire against his servants .
he sent Moses , his servant , and Aaron , whom he had chosen .
they performed miracles among them , and wonders in the land of ham .
he sent darkness , and made it dark . they didn 't rebel against his words .
he turned their waters into blood , and killed their fish .
their land swarmed with frogs , even in the rooms of their kings .
he spoke , and swarms of flies came , and lice in all their borders .
he gave them hail for rain , with lightning in their land .
he struck their vines and also their fig trees , and shattered the trees of their country .
he spoke , and the locusts came , and the grasshoppers , without number ,
ate up every plant in their land ; and ate up the fruit of their ground .
he struck also all the firstborn in their land , the first fruits of all their manhood .
he brought them forth with silver and gold . there was not one feeble person among his tribes .
Egypt was glad when they departed , for the fear of them had fallen on them .
he spread a cloud for a covering , fire to give light in the night .
they asked , and he brought quails , and satisfied them with the bread of the sky .
he opened the rock , and waters gushed out . they ran as a river in the dry places .
for he remembered his holy word , and Abraham , his servant .
he brought forth his people with joy , his chosen with singing .
he gave them the lands of the nations . they took the labor of the peoples in possession ,
that they might keep his statutes , and observe his laws . praise Yah !
praise Yahweh ! give thanks to Yahweh , for he is good , for his loving kindness endures forever .
who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh , or fully declare all his praise ?
blessed are those who keep justice . blessed is one who does what is right at all times .
remember me , Yahweh , with the favor that you show to your people . visit me with your salvation ,
that I may see the prosperity of your chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation , that I may glory with your inheritance .
we have sinned with our fathers . we have committed iniquity . we have done wickedly .
our fathers didn 't understand your wonders in Egypt . they didn 't remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses , but were rebellious at the sea , even at the Red Sea .
nevertheless he saved them for his name 's sake , that he might make his mighty power known .
he rebuked the Red Sea also , and it was dried up ; so he led them through the depths , as through a desert .
he saved them from the hand of him who hated them , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
the waters covered their adversaries . there was not one of them left .
then they believed his words . they sang his praise .
they soon forgot his works . they didn 't wait for his counsel ,
but gave in to craving in the desert , and tested God in the wasteland .
he gave them their request , but sent leanness into their soul .
they envied Moses also in the camp , and Aaron , Yahweh 's saint .
the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan , and covered the company of Abiram .
a fire was kindled in their company . the flame burned up the wicked .
they made a calf in Horeb , and worshiped a molten image .
thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass .
they forgot God , their Savior , who had done great things in Egypt ,
Wondrous works in the land of ham , and awesome things by the Red Sea .
therefore he said that he would destroy them , had Moses , his chosen , not stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wrath , so that he wouldn 't destroy them .
yes , they despised the pleasant land . they didn 't believe his word ,
but murmured in their tents , and didn 't listen to Yahweh 's voice .
therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness ,
they joined themselves also to Baal Peor , and ate the sacrifices of the dead .
thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds . the plague broke in on them .
then Phinehas stood up , and executed judgment , so the plague was stopped .
that was credited to him for righteousness , for all generations to come .
they angered him also at the waters of Meribah , so that Moses was troubled for their sakes ;
because they were rebellious against his spirit , he spoke rashly with his lips .
they didn 't destroy the peoples , as Yahweh commanded them ,
but mixed themselves with the nations , and learned their works .
they served their idols , which became a snare to them .
yes , they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons .
they shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan . the land was polluted with blood .
thus were they defiled with their works , and prostituted themselves in their deeds .
therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people . he abhorred his inheritance .
he gave them into the hand of the nations . those who hated them ruled over them .
their enemies also oppressed them . they were brought into subjection under their hand .
many times he delivered them , but they were rebellious in their counsel , and were brought low in their iniquity .
nevertheless he regarded their distress , when he heard their cry .
he remembered for them his Covenant , and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses .
he made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive .
save us , Yahweh , our God , gather us from among the nations , to give thanks to your holy name , to triumph in your praise !
blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , from everlasting even to everlasting ! let all the people say , " Amen . " praise Yah !
let the redeemed by Yahweh say so , whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary ,
and gathered out of the lands , from the east and from the west , from the north and from the south .
they wandered in the wilderness in a desert way . they found no city to live in .
hungry and thirsty , their soul fainted in them .
then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble , and he delivered them out of their distresses ,
he led them also by a straight way , that they might go to a city to live in .
let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful works to the children of men !
for he satisfies the longing soul . he fills the hungry soul with good .
some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death , being bound in affliction and iron ,
because they rebelled against the words of God , and condemned the counsel of the Most High .
therefore he brought down their heart with labor . they fell down , and there was none to help .
then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble , and he saved them out of their distresses .
he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death , and broke their bonds in sunder .
let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful works to the children of men !
for he has broken the gates of brass , and cut through bars of iron .
fools are afflicted because of their disobedience , and because of their iniquities .
their soul abhors all kinds of food . they draw near to the gates of death .
then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble , he saves them out of their distresses .
he sends his word , and heals them , and delivers them from their graves .
let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful works to the children of men !
let them offer the sacrifices of Thanksgiving , and declare his works with singing .
those who go down to the sea in ships , who do business in great waters ;
these see Yahweh 's works , and his wonders in the deep .
for he commands , and raises the stormy wind , which lifts up its waves .
they mount up to the sky ; they go down again to the depths . their soul melts away because of trouble .
they reel back and forth , and stagger like a drunken man , and are at their wits ' end .
then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble , and he brings them out of their distress .
he makes the storm a calm , so that its waves are still .
then they are glad because it is calm , so he brings them to their desired haven .
let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful works for the children of men !
let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people , and praise him in the seat of the elders .
he turns rivers into a desert , water springs into a thirsty ground ,
and a fruitful land into a salt waste , for the wickedness of those who dwell in it .
he turns a desert into a pool of water , and a dry land into water springs .
there he makes the hungry live , that they may prepare a city to live in ,
sow fields , plant vineyards , and reap the fruits of increase .
he blesses them also , so that they are multiplied greatly . he doesn 't allow their livestock to decrease .
again , they are diminished and bowed down through oppression , trouble , and sorrow .
he pours contempt on princes , and causes them to wander in a trackless waste .
yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction , and increases their families like a flock .
the upright will see it , and be glad . all the wicked will shut their mouths .
whoever is wise will pay attention to these things . they will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh .
< < A Song . a Psalm by David . > > My heart is steadfast , God . I will sing and I will make music with my soul .
wake up , harp and Lyre ! I will wake up the dawn .
I will give thanks to you , Yahweh , among the nations . I will sing praises to you among the peoples .
for your loving kindness is great above the heavens . your faithfulness reaches to the skies .
be exalted , God , above the heavens ! let your glory be over all the earth .
that your beloved may be delivered , save with your right hand , and answer us .
God has spoken from his sanctuary : " in triumph , I will divide Shechem , and measure out the valley of Succoth .
Gilead is mine . Manasseh is mine . Ephraim also is my helmet . Judah is my scepter .
Moab is my wash pot . I will Toss my sandal on Edom . I will shout over Philistia . "
who will bring me into the fortified city ? who has led me to Edom ?
haven 't you rejected us , God ? you don 't go forth , God , with our armies .
give us help against the enemy , for the help of man is vain .
through God , we will do valiantly . for it is he who will tread down our enemies .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > God of my praise , don 't remain silent ,
for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me . they have spoken to me with a lying tongue .
they have also surrounded me with words of hatred , and fought against me without a cause .
in return for my love , they are my adversaries ; but I am in prayer .
they have rewarded me evil for good , and hatred for my love .
set a wicked man over him . let an adversary stand at his right hand .
when he is judged , let him come forth guilty . let his prayer be turned into sin .
let his days be few . let another take his office .
let his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow .
let his children be wandering beggars . let them be sought from their ruins .
let the creditor seize all that he has . let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor .
let there be no one to extend kindness to him , neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children .
let his posterity be cut off . in the generation following let their name be blotted out .
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh . Don 't let the sin of his mother be blotted out .
let them be before Yahweh continually , that he may cut off their memory from the earth ;
because he didn 't remember to show kindness , but persecuted the poor and needy man , the broken in heart , to kill them .
yes , he loved cursing , and it came to him . he didn 't delight in blessing , and it was far from him .
he clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment . it came into his inward parts like water , like oil into his bones .
let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself , for the belt that is always around him .
this is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh , of those who speak evil against my soul .
but deal with me , Yahweh the Lord , for your name 's sake , because your loving kindness is good , deliver me ;
for I am poor and needy . my heart is wounded within me .
I fade away like an evening shadow . I am shaken off like a locust .
my knees are weak through fasting . my body is thin and lacks fat .
I have also become a reproach to them . when they see me , they shake their head .
help me , Yahweh , my God . save me according to your loving kindness ;
that they may know that this is your hand ; that you , Yahweh , have done it .
they may curse , but you bless . when they arise , they will be shamed , but your servant shall rejoice .
let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor . let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe .
I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth . yes , I will praise him among the multitude .
for he will stand at the right hand of the needy , to save him from those who judge his soul .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh says to my Lord , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet . "
Yahweh will send forth the rod of your strength out of Zion . rule in the midst of your enemies .
your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power , in holy array . out of the womb of the morning , you have the dew of your youth .
Yahweh has sworn , and will not change his mind : " you are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek . "
he will judge among the nations . he will heap up dead bodies . he will crush the ruler of the whole earth .
he will drink of the Brook in the way ; therefore he will lift up his head .
praise Yah ! I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart , in the council of the upright , and in the Congregation .
Yahweh 's works are great , pondered by all those who delight in them .
his work is honor and majesty . his righteousness endures forever .
he has caused his wonderful works to be remembered . Yahweh is gracious and merciful .
he has given food to those who fear him . he always remembers his Covenant .
he has shown his people the power of his works , in giving them the heritage of the nations .
the works of his hands are truth and justice . all his precepts are sure .
they are established forever and ever . they are done in truth and uprightness .
he has sent redemption to his people . he has ordained his Covenant forever . his name is holy and awesome !
the fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom . all those who do his work have a good understanding . his praise endures forever !
praise Yah ! blessed is the man who fears Yahweh , who delights greatly in his commandments .
his seed will be mighty in the land . the generation of the upright will be blessed .
wealth and riches are in his house . his righteousness endures forever .
light dawns in the darkness for the upright , gracious , merciful , and righteous .
it is well with the man who deals graciously and lends . he will maintain his cause in judgment .
for he will never be shaken . the righteous will be remembered forever .
he will not be afraid of evil news . his heart is steadfast , trusting in Yahweh .
his heart is established . he will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries .
he has dispersed , he has given to the poor . his righteousness endures forever . his Horn will be exalted with honor .
the wicked will see it , and be grieved . he shall gnash with his teeth , and melt away . the desire of the wicked will perish .
praise Yah ! praise , you servants of Yahweh , praise the name of Yahweh .
blessed be the name of Yahweh , from this time forth and forevermore .
from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same , Yahweh 's name is to be praised .
Yahweh is high above all nations , his glory above the heavens .
who is like Yahweh , our God , who has his seat on high ,
who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth ?
he raises up the poor out of the dust . lifts up the needy from the ash heap ;
that he may set him with princes , even with the princes of his people .
he settles the barren woman in her home , as a joyful mother of children . praise Yah !
when Israel went forth out of Egypt , the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language ;
Judah became his sanctuary , Israel his dominion .
the sea saw it , and fled . the Jordan was driven back .
the mountains skipped like rams , the little hills like lambs .
what was it , you sea , that you fled ? you Jordan , that you turned back ?
you mountains , that you skipped like rams ; you little hills , like lambs ?
Tremble , you earth , at the presence of the Lord , at the presence of the God of Jacob ,
not to us , Yahweh , not to us , but to your name give glory , for your loving kindness , and for your truth 's sake .
why should the nations say , " Where is their God , now ? "
but our God is in the heavens . he does whatever he pleases .
their idols are silver and gold , the work of men 's hands .
they have mouths , but they don 't speak . they have eyes , but they don 't see .
they have ears , but they don 't hear . they have noses , but they don 't smell .
they have hands , but they don 't feel . they have feet , but they don 't walk , neither do they speak through their throat .
those who make them will be like them ; yes , everyone who trusts in them .
Israel , trust in Yahweh ! he is their help and their shield .
house of Aaron , trust in Yahweh ! he is their help and their shield .
you who fear Yahweh , trust in Yahweh ! he is their help and their shield .
Yahweh remembers us . he will bless us . he will bless the house of Israel . he will bless the house of Aaron .
he will bless those who fear Yahweh , both small and great .
May Yahweh increase you more and more , you and your children .
blessed are you by Yahweh , who made heaven and earth .
the heavens are the heavens of Yahweh ; but the earth has he given to the children of men .
the dead don 't praise Yah , neither any who go down into silence ;
but we will bless Yah , from this time forth and forevermore . praise Yah !
I love Yahweh , because he listens to my voice , and my cries for mercy .
because he has turned his ear to me , therefore I will call on him as long as I live .
the cords of death surrounded me , the pains of Sheol got a hold of me . I found trouble and sorrow .
then I called on the name of Yahweh : " Yahweh , I beg you , deliver my soul . "
Yahweh is Gracious and righteous . yes , our God is merciful .
Yahweh preserves the simple . I was brought low , and he saved me .
return to your rest , my soul , for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you .
for you have delivered my soul from death , my eyes from tears , and my feet from falling .
I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living .
I said in my haste , " All men are liars . "
what will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me ?
I will take the cup of salvation , and call on the name of Yahweh .
I will pay my vows to Yahweh , yes , in the presence of all his people .
precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his saints .
Yahweh , truly I am your servant . I am your servant , the son of your handmaid . you have freed me from my chains .
I will offer to you the sacrifice of Thanksgiving , and will call on the name of Yahweh .
I will pay my vows to Yahweh , yes , in the presence of all his people ,
praise Yahweh , all you nations ! Extol him , all you peoples !
for his loving kindness is great toward us . Yahweh 's faithfulness endures forever . praise Yah !
let Israel now say that his loving kindness endures forever .
out of my distress , I called on Yah . Yah answered me with freedom .
Yahweh is on my side . I will not be afraid . what can man do to me ?
Yahweh is on my side among those who help me . therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me .
it is better to take refuge in Yahweh , than to put confidence in man .
it is better to take refuge in Yahweh , than to put confidence in princes .
all the nations surrounded me , but in the name of Yahweh , I cut them off .
they surrounded me , yes , they surrounded me . in the name of Yahweh I indeed cut them off .
they surrounded me like bees . they are quenched like the burning thorns . in the name of Yahweh I cut them off .
you pushed me back hard , to make me fall , but Yahweh helped me .
Yah is my strength and song . he has become my salvation .
the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous . " the right hand of Yahweh does valiantly .
the right hand of Yahweh is exalted ! the right hand of Yahweh does valiantly ! "
I will not die , but live , and declare Yah 's works .
Yah has punished me severely , but he has not given me over to death .
open to me the gates of righteousness . I will enter into them . I will give thanks to Yah .
this is the gate of Yahweh ; the righteous will enter into it .
I will give thanks to you , for you have answered me , and have become my salvation .
the stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner .
this is Yahweh 's doing . it is marvelous in our eyes .
this is the day that Yahweh has made . we will rejoice and be glad in it !
save us now , we beg you , Yahweh ! Yahweh , we beg you , send prosperity now .
blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh ! we have blessed you out of the house of Yahweh .
Yahweh is God , and he has given us light . bind the sacrifice with cords , even to the horns of the altar .
you are my God , and I will give thanks to you . you are my God , I will exalt you .
< < ALEPH > > blessed are those whose ways are blameless , who walk according to Yahweh 's law .

< < A Song of Ascents . > > In my distress , I cried to Yahweh . he answered me .
deliver my soul , Yahweh , from lying lips , from a deceitful tongue .
what will be given to you , and what will be done more to you , you deceitful tongue ?
sharp arrows of the mighty , with coals of juniper .
Woe is me , that I live in Meshech , that I dwell among the tents of Kedar !
my soul has had her dwelling too long with him who hates peace .
I am for peace , but when I speak , they are for war .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > I will lift up my eyes to the hills . where does my help come from ?
my help comes from Yahweh , who made heaven and earth .
he will not allow your foot to be moved . he who keeps you will not slumber .
behold , he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep .
Yahweh is your keeper . Yahweh is your shade on your right hand .
the sun will not harm you by day , nor the moon by night .
Yahweh will keep you from all evil . he will keep your soul .
Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in , from this time forth , and forevermore .
our feet are standing within your gates , Jerusalem ;
Jerusalem , that is built as a city that is compact together ;
where the tribes go up , even Yah 's tribes , according to an ordinance for Israel , to give thanks to the name of Yahweh .
for there are set thrones for judgment , the thrones of David 's house .
pray for the peace of Jerusalem . those who love you will prosper .
peace be within your walls , and prosperity within your palaces .
for my brothers ' and companions ' sakes , I will now say , " Peace be within you . "
for the sake of the house of Yahweh our God , I will seek your good .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > To you I do lift up my eyes , you who sit in the heavens .
behold , as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master , as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress ; so our eyes look to Yahweh , our God , until he has mercy on us .
have mercy on us , Yahweh , have mercy on us , for we have endured much contempt .
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease , with the contempt of the proud .
< < A Song of Ascents . by David . > > If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side , let Israel now say ,
if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side , when men rose up against us ;
then they would have swallowed us up alive , when their wrath was kindled against us ;
then the waters would have overwhelmed us , the stream would have gone over our soul ;
then the proud waters would have gone over our soul .
blessed be Yahweh , who has not given us as a prey to their teeth .
our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler 's snare . the snare is broken , and we have escaped .
our help is in the name of Yahweh , who made heaven and earth .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion , which can 't be moved , but remains forever .
as the mountains surround Jerusalem , so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forth and forevermore .
for the scepter of wickedness won 't remain over the allotment of the righteous ; so that the righteous won 't use their hands to do evil .
do good , Yahweh , to those who are good , to those who are upright in their hearts .
but as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways , Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity . peace be on Israel .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion , we were like those who dream .
then our mouth was filled with laughter , and our tongue with singing . then they said among the nations , " Yahweh has done great things for them . "
Yahweh has done great things for us , and we are glad .
restore our fortunes again , Yahweh , like the streams in the Negev .
those who sow in tears will reap in joy .
he who goes out weeping , carrying seed for sowing , will certainly come again with joy , carrying his sheaves .
< < A Song of Ascents . by Solomon . > > Unless Yahweh builds the house , they labor in vain who build it . unless Yahweh watches over the city , the watchman guards it in vain .
it is vain for you to rise up early , to stay up late , eating the bread of toil ; for he gives sleep to his loved ones .
behold , children are a heritage of Yahweh . the fruit of the womb is his reward .
as arrows in the hand of a mighty man , so are the children of youth .
happy is the man who has his quiver full of them . they won 't be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh , who walks in his ways .
for you will eat the labor of your hands . you will be happy , and it will be well with you .
your wife will be as a fruitful vine , in the innermost parts of your house ; your children like olive plants , around your table .
behold , thus is the man blessed who fears Yahweh .
May Yahweh bless you out of Zion , and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life .
yes , may you see your children 's children . peace be upon Israel .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up . let Israel now say ,
many times they have afflicted me from my youth up , yet they have not prevailed against me .
the plowers plowed on my back . they made their furrows long .
Yahweh is righteous . he has cut apart the cords of the wicked .
let them be disappointed and turned backward , all those who hate Zion .
let them be as the grass on the housetops , which Withers before it grows up ;
with which the reaper doesn 't fill his hand , nor he who binds sheaves , his bosom .
neither do those who go by say , " The blessing of Yahweh be on you . we bless you in the name of Yahweh . "
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Out of the depths I have cried to you , Yahweh .
Lord , hear my voice . let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions .
if you , Yah , kept a record of sins , Lord , who could stand ?
but there is forgiveness with you , therefore you are feared .
I wait for Yahweh . my soul waits . I hope in his word .
my soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning ; more than watchmen for the morning .
Israel , hope in Yahweh , for with Yahweh there is loving kindness . with him is abundant redemption .
he will redeem Israel from all their sins .
< < A Song of Ascents . by David . > > Yahweh , my heart isn 't haughty , nor my eyes lofty ; nor do I concern myself with great matters , or things too wonderful for me .
surely I have stilled and quieted my soul , like a weaned child with his mother , like a weaned child is my soul within me .
Israel , hope in Yahweh , from this time forth and forevermore .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Yahweh , remember David and all his affliction ,
" surely I will not come into the structure of my house , nor go up into my bed ;
I will not give sleep to my eyes , or slumber to my eyelids ;
until I find out a place for Yahweh , a dwelling for the mighty One of Jacob . "
behold , we heard of it in Ephrathah . we found it in the field of Jaar :
" we will go into his dwelling place . we will worship at his footstool .
arise , Yahweh , into your resting place ; you , and the Ark of your strength .
let your priest be clothed with righteousness . let your saints shout for joy ! "
for your servant David 's sake , don 't turn away the face of your anointed one .
Yahweh has sworn to David in truth . he will not turn from it : " I will set the fruit of your body on your throne .
if your children will keep my Covenant , my testimony that I will teach them , their children also will sit on your throne forevermore . "
for Yahweh has chosen Zion . he has desired it for his habitation .
" this is my resting place forever . here I will live , for I have desired it .
I will abundantly bless her provision . I will satisfy her poor with bread .
her priests I will also clothe with salvation . her saints will shout aloud for joy .
there I will make the Horn of David to bud . I have ordained a lamp for my anointed .
I will clothe his enemies with shame , but on himself , his crown will be resplendent . "
< < A Song of Ascents . by David . > > See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity !
it is like the precious oil on the head , that ran down on the beard , even Aaron 's beard ; that came down on the edge of his robes ;
like the dew of Hermon , that comes down on the hills of Zion : for there Yahweh gives the blessing , even life forevermore .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Look ! praise Yahweh , all you servants of Yahweh , who stand by night in Yahweh 's house !
lift up your hands in the sanctuary . praise Yahweh !
May Yahweh bless you from Zion ; even he who made heaven and earth .
praise Yah ! praise the name of Yahweh ! praise him , you servants of Yahweh ,
for Yah has chosen Jacob for himself ; Israel for his own possession .
for I know that Yahweh is great , that our Lord is above all gods .
whatever Yahweh pleased , that he has done , in heaven and in earth , in the seas and in all deeps ;
who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth ; who makes lightnings with the rain ; who brings forth the wind out of his treasuries ;
who struck the firstborn of Egypt , both of man and animal ;
who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you , Egypt , on Pharaoh , and on all his servants ;
who struck many nations , and killed mighty kings ,
Sihon king of the Amorites , Og king of Bashan , and all the kingdoms of Canaan ,
and gave their land for a heritage , a heritage to Israel , his people .
your name , Yahweh , endures forever ; your renown , Yahweh , throughout all generations .
for Yahweh will judge his people , and have compassion on his servants .
the idols of the nations are silver and gold , the work of men 's hands .
they have mouths , but they can 't speak . they have eyes , but they can 't see .
they have ears , but they can 't hear ; neither is there any breath in their mouths .
those who make them will be like them ; yes , everyone who trusts in them .
house of Israel , praise Yahweh ! house of Aaron , praise Yahweh !
house of Levi , praise Yahweh ! you who fear Yahweh , praise Yahweh !
give thanks to the God of gods ; for his loving kindness endures forever .
to him who alone does great wonders ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who by understanding made the heavens ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who spread out the earth above the waters ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who made the great lights ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
the sun to rule by day ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
the moon and stars to rule by night ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who struck down the Egyptian firstborn ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
and brought out Israel from among them ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
to him who divided the Red Sea apart ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
and made Israel to pass through its midst ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who led his people through the wilderness ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who struck great kings ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
and killed mighty kings ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
Og king of Bashan ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
and gave their land as an inheritance ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
who remembered us in our low estate ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
and has delivered us from our adversaries ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
who gives food to every creature ; for his loving kindness endures forever .
Oh give thanks to the God of heaven ; for his loving kindness endures forever .
by the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down . yes , we wept , when we remembered Zion .
on the willows in its midst , we hung up our harps .
for there , those who led us captive asked us for songs . those who tormented us demanded songs of joy : " sing us one of the songs of Zion ! "
how can we sing Yahweh 's song in a foreign land ?
if I forget you , Jerusalem , let my right hand forget its skill .
let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don 't remember you ; if I don 't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy .
remember , Yahweh , against the children of Edom , the day of Jerusalem ; who said , " raze it ! raze it even to its foundation ! "
daughter of Babylon , doomed to destruction , he will be happy who rewards you , as you have served us .
happy shall he be , who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock .
< < By David . > > I will give you thanks with my whole heart . before the gods , I will sing praises to you .
I will bow down toward your holy temple , and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth ; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all .
in the day that I called , you answered me . you encouraged me with strength in my soul .
all the kings of the earth will give you thanks , Yahweh , for they have heard the words of your mouth .
yes , they will sing of the ways of Yahweh ; for great is Yahweh 's glory .
for though Yahweh is high , yet he looks after the lowly ; but the proud , he knows from afar .
though I walk in the midst of trouble , you will revive me . you will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies . your right hand will save me .
Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me ; your loving kindness , Yahweh , endures forever . Don 't forsake the works of your own hands .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , you have searched me , and you know me .
you know my sitting down and my rising up . you perceive my thoughts from afar .
you search out my path and my lying down , and are acquainted with all my ways .
for there is not a word on my tongue , but , behold , Yahweh , you know it altogether .
you hem me in behind and before . you laid your hand on me .
this knowledge is beyond me . it 's lofty . I can 't attain it .
where could I go from your Spirit ? or where could I flee from your presence ?
if I ascend up into heaven , you are there . if I make my bed in Sheol , behold , you are there !
if I take the wings of the dawn , and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea ;
even there your hand will lead me , and your right hand will hold me .
if I say , " surely the darkness will overwhelm me ; the light around me will be night " ;
even the darkness doesn 't hide from you , but the night shines as the day . the darkness is like light to you .
for you formed my inmost being . you knit me together in my mother 's womb .
I will give thanks to you , for I am fearfully and wonderfully made . your works are wonderful . my soul knows that very well .
my frame wasn 't hidden from you , when I was made in secret , woven together in the depths of the earth .
your eyes saw my body . in your book they were all written , the days that were ordained for me , when as yet there were none of them .
how precious to me are your thoughts , God ! how vast is their sum !
if I would count them , they are more in number than the sand . when I wake up , I am still with you .
if only you , God , would kill the wicked . get away from me , you bloodthirsty men !
for they speak against you wickedly . your enemies take your name in vain .
Yahweh , don 't I hate those who hate you ? am I not grieved with those who rise up against you ?
I hate them with perfect hatred . they have become my enemies .
search me , God , and know my heart . try me , and know my thoughts .
see if there is any wicked way in me , and lead me in the everlasting way .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > Deliver me , Yahweh , from the evil man . preserve me from the violent man ;
those who devise mischief in their hearts . they continually gather themselves together for war .
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent . Viper 's poison is under their lips . Selah .
Yahweh , keep me from the hands of the wicked . preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet .
the proud have hidden a snare for me , they have spread the cords of a net by the path . they have set traps for me . Selah .
I said to Yahweh , " You are my God . " listen to the cry of my petitions , Yahweh .
Yahweh , the Lord , the strength of my salvation , you have covered my head in the day of battle .
Yahweh , don 't grant the desires of the wicked . Don 't let their evil plans succeed , or they will become proud . Selah .
as for the head of those who surround me , let the mischief of their own lips cover them .
let burning coals fall on them . let them be thrown into the fire , into miry pits , from where they never rise .
an evil speaker won 't be established in the earth . evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him .
I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted , and justice for the needy .
surely the righteous will give thanks to your name . the upright will dwell in your presence .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , I have called on you . come to me quickly ! listen to my voice when I call to you .
let my prayer be set before you like incense ; the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice .
set a watch , Yahweh , before my mouth . keep the door of my lips .
Don 't incline my heart to any evil thing , to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity . Don 't let me eat of their delicacies .
let the righteous strike me , it is kindness ; let him reprove me , it is like oil on the head ; don 't let my head refuse it ; Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds .
their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock . they will hear my words , for they are well spoken .
" as when one plows and breaks up the earth , our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol . "
for my eyes are on you , Yahweh , the Lord . in you , I take refuge . Don 't leave my soul destitute .
keep me from the snare which they have laid for me , from the traps of the workers of iniquity .
let the wicked fall together into their own nets , while I pass by .
< < A contemplation by David , when he was in the cave . a Prayer . > > I cry with my voice to Yahweh . with my voice , I ask Yahweh for mercy .
I pour out my complaint before him . I tell him my troubles .
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me , you knew my path . in the way in which I walk , they have hidden a snare for me .
look on my right , and see ; for there is no one who is concerned for me . refuge has fled from me . no one cares for my soul .
I cried to you , Yahweh . I said , " You are my refuge , my portion in the land of the living . "
listen to my cry , for I am in desperate need. deliver me from my persecutors , For they are stronger than me .
bring my soul out of prison , that I may give thanks to your name . the righteous will surround me , for you will be good to me .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Hear my prayer , Yahweh . listen to my petitions . in your faithfulness and righteousness , relieve me .
Don 't enter into judgment with your servant , for in your sight no man living is righteous .
for the enemy pursues my soul . he has struck my life down to the ground . he has made me live in dark places , as those who have been long dead .
therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me . my heart within me is desolate .
I remember the days of old . I meditate on all your doings . I contemplate the work of your hands .
I spread forth my hands to you . my soul thirsts for you , like a parched land . Selah .
hurry to answer me , Yahweh . my spirit fails . Don 't hide your face from me , so that I don 't become like those who go down into the pit .
cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning , for I trust in you . cause me to know the way in which I should walk , for I lift up my soul to you .
deliver me , Yahweh , from my enemies . I flee to you to hide me .
teach me to do your will , for you are my God . your Spirit is good . lead me in the land of uprightness .
revive me , Yahweh , for your name 's sake . in your righteousness , bring my soul out of trouble .
in your loving kindness , cut off my enemies , and destroy all those who afflict my soul , For I am your servant .
< < By David . > > blessed be Yahweh , my rock , who teaches my hands to war , and my fingers to battle :
my loving kindness , my fortress , my high tower , my deliverer , my shield , and he in whom I take refuge ; who subdues my people under me .
Yahweh , what is man , that you care for him ? or the son of man , that you think of him ?
man is like a breath . his days are like a shadow that passes away .
part your heavens , Yahweh , and come down . touch the mountains , and they will smoke .
throw out lightning , and scatter them . send out your arrows , and rout them .
stretch out your hand from above , rescue me , and deliver me out of great waters , out of the hands of foreigners ;
whose mouths speak deceit , whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood .
you are he who gives salvation to kings , who rescues David , his servant , from the deadly sword .
rescue me , and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners , whose mouths speak deceit , whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood .
then our sons will be like well @-@ nurtured plants , our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace .
our barns are full , filled with all kinds of provision . our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields .
our oxen will pull heavy loads . there is no breaking in , and no going away , and no outcry in our streets .
happy are the people who are in such a situation . happy are the people whose God is Yahweh .
< < A praise psalm by David.This is an acrostic psalm , with every verse ( including the second half of verse 13 ) starting with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet . > > I will exalt you , my God , the King . I will praise your name forever and ever .
every day I will praise you . I will extol your name forever and ever .
great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised ! his greatness is unsearchable .
one generation will commend your works to another , and will declare your mighty acts .
of the glorious majesty of your honor , of your wondrous works , I will meditate .
men will speak of the might of your awesome acts . I will declare your greatness .
they will utter the memory of your great Goodness , and will sing of your righteousness .
Yahweh is gracious , merciful , slow to anger , and of great loving kindness .
Yahweh is good to all . his tender mercies are over all his works .
all your works will give thanks to you , Yahweh . your saints will extol you .
they will speak of the glory of your kingdom , and talk about your power ;
to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts , the glory of the majesty of his kingdom .
your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom . your dominion endures throughout all generations . Yahweh is faithful in all his words , and loving in all his deeds .
Yahweh upholds all who fall , and raises up all those who are bowed down .
the eyes of all wait for you . you give them their food in due season .
you open your hand , and satisfy the desire of every living thing .
Yahweh is righteous in all his ways , and gracious in all his works .
Yahweh is near to all those who call on him , to all who call on him in truth .
he will fulfill the desire of those who fear him . he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
Yahweh preserves all those who love him , but all the wicked he will destroy .
my mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh . let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever .
while I live , I will praise Yahweh . I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist .
Don 't put your trust in princes , each a son of man in whom there is no help .
his spirit departs , and he returns to the earth . in that very day , his thoughts perish .
happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help , whose hope is in Yahweh , his God :
who made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that is in them ; who keeps truth forever ;
who executes justice for the oppressed ; who gives food to the hungry . Yahweh frees the prisoners .
Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind . Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down . Yahweh loves the righteous .
Yahweh preserves the foreigners . he upholds the fatherless and widow , but the way of the wicked he turns Upside down .
Yahweh will reign forever ; your God , O Zion , to all generations . praise Yah !
Yahweh builds up Jerusalem . he gathers together the outcasts of Israel .
he heals the broken in heart , and binds up their wounds .
he counts the number of the stars . he calls them all by their names .
great is our Lord , and mighty in power . his understanding is infinite .
Yahweh upholds the humble . he brings the wicked down to the ground .
sing to Yahweh with Thanksgiving . sing praises on the harp to our God ,
who covers the sky with clouds , who prepares rain for the earth , who makes grass grow on the mountains .
he provides food for the livestock , and for the young ravens when they call .
he doesn 't delight in the strength of the horse . he takes no pleasure in the legs of a man .
Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him , in those who hope in his loving kindness .
for he has strengthened the bars of your gates . he has blessed your children within you .
he makes peace in your borders . he fills you with the finest of the wheat .
he sends out his commandment to the earth . his word runs very swiftly .
he gives snow like wool , and scatters Frost like ashes .
he hurls down his hail like pebbles . who can stand before his cold ?
he sends out his word , and melts them . he causes his wind to blow , and the waters flow .
he shows his word to Jacob ; his statutes and his ordinances to Israel .
he has not done this for just any nation . they don 't know his ordinances . praise Yah !
praise Yah ! praise Yahweh from the heavens ! praise him in the heights !
praise him , all his angels ! praise him , all his army !
praise him , sun and moon ! praise him , all you shining stars !
praise him , you heavens of heavens , You waters that are above the heavens .
let them praise the name of Yahweh , For he commanded , and they were created .
he has also established them forever and ever . he has made a decree which will not pass away .
praise Yahweh from the earth , you great sea creatures , and all depths !
lightning and hail , snow and clouds ; stormy wind , fulfilling his word ;
mountains and all hills ; fruit trees and all cedars ;
wild animals and all livestock ; small creatures and flying birds ;
Kings of the earth and all peoples ; princes and all judges of the earth ;
both young men and maidens ; old men and children :
let them praise the name of Yahweh , for his name alone is exalted . his glory is above the earth and the heavens .
he has lifted up the Horn of his people , the praise of all his saints ; even of the children of Israel , a people near to him . praise Yah !
praise Yahweh ! sing to Yahweh a new song , his praise in the assembly of the saints .
let Israel rejoice in him who made them . let the children of Zion be joyful in their King .
let them praise his name in the dance ! let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp !
for Yahweh takes pleasure in his people . he crowns the humble with salvation .
let the saints rejoice in honor . let them sing for joy on their beds .
May the high praises of God be in their mouths , and a two @-@ edged sword in their hand ;
to bind their kings with chains , and their nobles with fetters of iron ;
to execute on them the written judgment . all his saints have this honor . praise Yah !
praise Yah ! praise God in his sanctuary ! praise him in his heavens for his acts of power !
praise him for his mighty acts ! praise him according to his excellent greatness !
praise him with the sounding of the trumpet ! praise him with harp and Lyre !
praise him with tambourine and dancing ! praise him with stringed instruments and flute !
praise him with loud cymbals ! praise him with resounding cymbals !

the Proverbs of Solomon , the son of David , king of Israel :
to know wisdom and instruction ; to discern the words of understanding ;
to receive instruction in wise dealing , in righteousness , justice , and equity ;
to give prudence to the simple , knowledge and discretion to the young man :
that the wise man may hear , and increase in learning ; that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel :
the fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge ; but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction .
my son , listen to your father 's instruction , and don 't forsake your mother 's teaching :
for they will be a garland to grace your head , and chains around your neck .
if they say , " Come with us , Let 's lay in wait for blood ; let 's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause ;
let 's swallow them up alive like Sheol , and whole , like those who go down into the pit .
we 'll find all valuable wealth . we 'll fill our houses with spoil .
you shall cast your lot among us . we 'll all have one purse . "
my son , don 't walk in the way with them . keep your foot from their path ,
for their feet run to evil . they hurry to shed blood .
for in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird :
but these lay wait for their own blood . they lurk secretly for their own lives .
so are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain . it takes away the life of its owners .
wisdom calls aloud in the street . she utters her voice in the public squares .
she calls at the head of noisy places . at the entrance of the city gates , she utters her words :
" how long , you simple ones , will you love simplicity ? how long will mockers delight themselves in mockery , and fools hate knowledge ?
turn at my reproof . behold , I will pour out my spirit on you . I will make known my words to you .
because I have called , and you have refused ; I have stretched out my hand , and no one has paid attention ;
but you have ignored all my counsel , and wanted none of my reproof ;
I also will laugh at your disaster . I will mock when calamity overtakes you ;
then will they call on me , but I will not answer . they will seek me diligently , but they will not find me ;
because they hated knowledge , and didn 't choose the fear of Yahweh .
they wanted none of my counsel . they despised all my reproof .
therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way , and be filled with their own schemes .
for the backsliding of the simple will kill them . the careless ease of fools will destroy them .
but whoever listens to me will dwell securely , and will be at ease , without fear of harm . "
my son , if you will receive my words , and store up my commandments within you ;
yes , if you call out for discernment , and lift up your voice for understanding ;
if you seek her as silver , and search for her as for hidden treasures :
then you will understand the fear of Yahweh , and find the knowledge of God .
for Yahweh gives wisdom . out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding .
he lays up sound wisdom for the upright . he is a shield to those who walk in integrity ;
that he may guard the paths of justice , and preserve the way of his saints .
then you will understand righteousness and justice , equity and every good path .
for wisdom will enter into your heart . knowledge will be pleasant to your soul .
discretion will watch over you . understanding will keep you ,
to deliver you from the way of evil , from the men who speak perverse things ;
who forsake the paths of uprightness , to walk in the ways of darkness ;
who rejoice to do evil , and delight in the perverseness of evil ;
who are crooked in their ways , and wayward in their paths :
to deliver you from the strange woman , even from the foreigner who flatters with her words ;
for her house leads down to death , her paths to the dead .
none who go to her return again , neither do they attain to the paths of life :
that you may walk in the way of good men , and keep the paths of the righteous .
for the upright will dwell in the land . the perfect will remain in it .
but the wicked will be cut off from the land . the treacherous will be rooted out of it .
my son , don 't forget my teaching ; but let your heart keep my commandments :
for length of days , and years of life , and peace , will they add to you .
Don 't let kindness and truth forsake you . bind them around your neck . write them on the tablet of your heart .
so you will find favor , and good understanding in the sight of God and man .
trust in Yahweh with all your heart , and don 't lean on your own understanding .
in all your ways acknowledge him , and he will make your paths straight .
Don 't be wise in your own eyes . fear Yahweh , and depart from evil .
it will be health to your body , and nourishment to your bones .
honor Yahweh with your substance , with the first fruits of all your increase :
so your barns will be filled with plenty , and your vats will overflow with new wine .
my son , don 't despise Yahweh 's discipline , neither be weary of his reproof :
for whom Yahweh loves , he reproves ; even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights .
happy is the man who finds wisdom , the man who gets understanding .
for her good profit is better than getting silver , and her return is better than fine gold .
she is more precious than rubies . none of the things you can desire are to be compared to her .
length of days is in her right hand . in her left hand are riches and honor .
her ways are ways of pleasantness . all her paths are peace .
she is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her . happy is everyone who retains her .
by wisdom Yahweh founded the earth . by understanding , he established the heavens .
by his knowledge , the depths were broken up , and the skies drop down the dew .
my son , let them not depart from your eyes . keep sound wisdom and discretion :
so they will be life to your soul , and grace for your neck .
then you shall walk in your way securely . your foot won 't stumble .
when you lie down , you will not be afraid . yes , you will lie down , and your sleep will be sweet .
Don 't be afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it comes :
for Yahweh will be your confidence , and will keep your foot from being taken .
Don 't withhold good from those to whom it is due , when it is in the power of your hand to do it .
Don 't say to your neighbor , " Go , and come again ; tomorrow I will give it to you , " when you have it by you .
Don 't devise evil against your neighbor , since he dwells securely by you .
Don 't strive with a man without cause , if he has done you no harm .
Don 't envy the man of violence . choose none of his ways .
for the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh , but his friendship is with the upright .
Yahweh 's curse is in the house of the wicked , but he blesses the habitation of the righteous .
surely he mocks the mockers , but he gives grace to the humble .
the wise will inherit glory , but shame will be the promotion of fools .
listen , sons , to a father 's instruction . pay attention and know understanding ;
for I give you sound learning . Don 't forsake my law .
for I was a son to my father , tender and an only child in the sight of my mother .
he taught me , and said to me : " let your heart retain my words . keep my commandments , and live .
get wisdom . get understanding . Don 't forget , neither swerve from the words of my mouth .
Don 't forsake her , and she will preserve you . love her , and she will keep you .
wisdom is supreme . get wisdom . yes , though it costs all your possessions , get understanding .
esteem her , and she will exalt you . she will bring you to honor , when you embrace her .
she will give to your head a garland of grace . she will deliver a crown of splendor to you . "
listen , my son , and receive my sayings . the years of your life will be many .
I have taught you in the way of wisdom . I have led you in straight paths .
when you go , your steps will not be hampered . when you run , you will not stumble .
take firm hold of instruction . Don 't let her go . keep her , for she is your life .
Don 't enter into the path of the wicked . Don 't walk in the way of evil men .
avoid it , and don 't pass by it . turn from it , and pass on .
for they don 't sleep , unless they do evil . their sleep is taken away , unless they make someone fall .
for they eat the bread of wickedness , and drink the wine of violence .
but the path of the righteous is like the dawning light , that shines more and more until the perfect day .
the way of the wicked is like darkness . they don 't know what they stumble over .
my son , attend to my words . turn your ear to my sayings .
let them not depart from your eyes . keep them in the midst of your heart .
for they are life to those who find them , and health to their whole body .
keep your heart with all diligence , for out of it is the wellspring of life .
put away from yourself a perverse mouth . put corrupt lips far from you .
let your eyes look straight ahead . fix your gaze directly before you .
make the path of your feet level . let all of your ways be established .
Don 't turn to the right hand nor to the left . remove your foot from evil .
my son , pay attention to my wisdom . turn your ear to my understanding :
that you may maintain discretion , that your lips may preserve knowledge .
for the lips of an adulteress drip honey . her mouth is smoother than oil ,
but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood , and as sharp as a two @-@ edged sword .
her feet go down to death . her steps lead straight to Sheol .
she gives no thought to the way of life . her ways are crooked , and she doesn 't know it .
now therefore , my sons , listen to me . Don 't depart from the words of my mouth .
remove your way far from her . Don 't come near the door of her house ,
lest you give your honor to others , and your years to the cruel one ;
lest strangers feast on your wealth , and your labors enrich another man 's house .
you will groan at your latter end , when your flesh and your body are consumed ,
and say , " How I have hated instruction , and my heart despised reproof ;
neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor turned my ear to those who instructed me !
I have come to the brink of utter ruin , in the midst of the gathered assembly . "
drink water out of your own cistern , running water out of your own well .
should your springs overflow in the streets , streams of water in the public squares ?
let them be for yourself alone , not for strangers with you .
let your spring be blessed . rejoice in the wife of your youth .
a loving doe and a graceful deer-- let her breasts satisfy you at all times . be captivated always with her love .
for why should you , my son , be captivated with an adulteress ? why embrace the bosom of another ?
for the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh . he examines all his paths .
the evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him . the cords of his sin hold him firmly .
he will die for lack of instruction . in the greatness of his Folly , he will go astray .
my son , if you have become collateral for your neighbor , if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger ;
you are trapped by the words of your mouth . you are ensnared with the words of your mouth .
do this now , my son , and deliver yourself , since you have come into the hand of your neighbor . go , humble yourself . press your plea with your neighbor .
give no sleep to your eyes , nor slumber to your eyelids .
free yourself , like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter , like a bird from the snare of the fowler .
go to the ANT , you sluggard . consider her ways , and be wise ;
which having no chief , overseer , or ruler ,
provides her bread in the summer , and gathers her food in the harvest .
how long will you sleep , sluggard ? when will you arise out of your sleep ?
a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep :
so your poverty will come as a robber , and your scarcity as an armed man .
a worthless person , a man of iniquity , is he who walks with a perverse mouth ;
who winks with his eyes , who signals with his feet , who motions with his fingers ;
in whose heart is perverseness , who devises evil continually , who always sows discord .
therefore his calamity will come suddenly . he will be broken suddenly , and that without remedy .
there are six things which Yahweh hates ; yes , seven which are an abomination to him :
haughty eyes , a lying tongue , hands that shed innocent blood ;
a heart that devises wicked schemes , feet that are swift in running to mischief ,
a false witness who utters lies , and he who sows discord among brothers .
my son , keep your father 's commandment , and don 't forsake your mother 's teaching .
bind them continually on your heart . tie them around your neck .
when you walk , it will lead you . when you sleep , it will watch over you . when you awake , it will talk with you .
for the commandment is a lamp , and the law is light . Reproofs of instruction are the way of life ,
to keep you from the immoral woman , from the flattery of the wayward wife 's tongue .
Don 't lust after her beauty in your heart , neither let her captivate you with her eyelids .
can a man scoop fire into his lap , and his clothes not be burned ?
or can one walk on hot coals , and his feet not be scorched ?
so is he who goes in to his neighbor 's wife . whoever touches her will not be unpunished .
men don 't despise a thief , if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry :
but if he is found , he shall restore seven times . he shall give all the wealth of his house .
he who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding . he who does it destroys his own soul .
he will get wounds and dishonor . his reproach will not be wiped away .
for jealousy arouses the fury of the husband . he won 't spare in the day of vengeance .
he won 't regard any ransom , neither will he rest content , though you give many gifts .
my son , keep my words . lay up my commandments within you .
keep my commandments and live ! guard my teaching as the apple of your eye .
bind them on your fingers . write them on the tablet of your heart .
tell wisdom , " You are my sister . " call understanding your relative ,
that they may keep you from the strange woman , from the foreigner who flatters with her words .
for at the window of my house , I looked out through my lattice .
I saw among the simple ones . I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding ,
passing through the street near her corner , he went the way to her house ,
behold , there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute , and with crafty intent .
she is loud and defiant . her feet don 't stay in her house .
now she is in the streets , now in the squares , and lurking at every corner .
so she caught him , and kissed him . with an impudent face she said to him :
" sacrifices of peace offerings are with me . this day I have paid my vows .
therefore I came out to meet you , to diligently seek your face , and I have found you .
I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry , with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt .
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh , aloes , and Cinnamon .
come , let 's take our fill of loving until the morning . let 's solace ourselves with loving .
for my husband isn 't at home . he has gone on a long journey .
he has taken a bag of money with him . he will come home at the full moon . "
with persuasive words , she led him astray . with the flattering of her lips , she seduced him .
he followed her immediately , as an ox goes to the slaughter , as a fool stepping into a noose .
until an arrow strikes through his liver , as a bird hurries to the snare , and doesn 't know that it will cost his life .
now therefore , sons , listen to me . pay attention to the words of my mouth .
Don 't let your heart turn to her ways . Don 't go astray in her paths ,

" to you men , I call ! I send my voice to the sons of mankind .
you simple , understand prudence . you fools , be of an understanding heart .
hear , for I will speak excellent things . the opening of my lips is for right things .
for my mouth speaks truth . Wickedness is an abomination to my lips .

" Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work , before his deeds of old .
I was set up from everlasting , from the beginning , before the earth existed .
when there were no depths , I was brought forth , when there were no springs abounding with water .
before the mountains were settled in place , before the hills , I was brought forth ;
when he established the heavens , I was there ; when he set a circle on the surface of the deep ,
when he established the clouds above , when the springs of the deep became strong ,
when he gave to the sea its boundary , that the waters should not violate his commandment , when he marked out the foundations of the earth ;
then I was the craftsman by his side . I was a delight day by day , always rejoicing before him ,
Rejoicing in his whole world . my delight was with the sons of men .
" now therefore , my sons , listen to me , for blessed are those who keep my ways .
hear instruction , and be wise . Don 't refuse it .
blessed is the man who hears me , watching daily at my gates , waiting at my door posts .
for whoever finds me , finds life , and will obtain favor from Yahweh .
but he who sins against me wrongs his own soul . all those who hate me love death . "

whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor , he will also cry out , but shall not be heard .
a gift in secret pacifies anger ; and a bribe in the cloak , strong wrath .
it is joy to the righteous to do justice ; but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity .
the man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the dead .
he who loves pleasure shall be a poor man . he who loves wine and oil shall not be rich .
the wicked is a ransom for the righteous ; the treacherous for the upright .
it is better to dwell in a desert land , than with a contentious and fretful woman .
there is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise ; but a foolish man swallows it up .
he who follows after righteousness and kindness finds life , righteousness , and honor .
a wise man scales the city of the mighty , and brings down the strength of its confidence .
whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles .
the proud and haughty man , " scoffer " is his name ; he works in the arrogance of pride .
the desire of the sluggard kills him , for his hands refuse to labor .
there are those who covet greedily all day long ; but the righteous give and don 't withhold .
the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination : how much more , when he brings it with a wicked mind !
a false witness will perish , and a man who listens speaks to eternity .
a wicked man hardens his face ; but as for the upright , he establishes his ways .
there is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Yahweh .
the horse is prepared for the day of battle ; but victory is with Yahweh .
a good name is more desirable than great riches , and loving favor is better than silver and gold .
the rich and the poor have this in common : Yahweh is the maker of them all .
a prudent man sees danger , and hides himself ; but the simple pass on , and suffer for it .
the result of humility and the fear of Yahweh is wealth , honor , and life .
thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked : whoever guards his soul stays from them .
train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not depart from it .
the rich rule over the poor . the borrower is servant to the lender .
he who sows wickedness reaps trouble , and the rod of his fury will be destroyed .
he who has a generous eye will be blessed ; for he shares his food with the poor .
drive out the mocker , and strife will go out ; yes , quarrels and insults will stop .
he who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully is the king 's friend .
the eyes of Yahweh watch over knowledge ; but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful .
the sluggard says , " There is a lion outside ! I will be killed in the streets ! "
the mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit : he who is under Yahweh 's wrath will fall into it .
Folly is bound up in the heart of a child : the rod of discipline drives it far from him .
whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich , both come to poverty .
turn your ear , and listen to the words of the wise . apply your heart to my teaching .
for it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you , if all of them are ready on your lips .
that your trust may be in Yahweh , I teach you today , even you .
haven 't I written to you thirty excellent things of counsel and knowledge ,
to teach you truth , reliable words , to give sound answers to the ones who sent you ?
Don 't exploit the poor , because he is poor ; and don 't crush the needy in court ;
for Yahweh will plead their case , and plunder the life of those who plunder them .
Don 't befriend a hot @-@ tempered man , and don 't associate with one who harbors anger :
lest you learn his ways , and ensnare your soul .
Don 't you be one of those who strike hands , of those who are collateral for debts .
if you don 't have means to pay , why should he take away your bed from under you ?
Don 't move the ancient boundary stone , which your fathers have set up .
do you see a man skilled in his work ? he will serve kings . he won 't serve obscure men .
when you sit to eat with a ruler , consider diligently what is before you ;
put a knife to your throat , if you are a man given to appetite .
Don 't be desirous of his dainties , since they are deceitful food .
Don 't weary yourself to be rich . in your wisdom , show restraint .
why do you set your eyes on that which is not ? for it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky .
Don 't eat the food of him who has a stingy eye , and don 't crave his delicacies :
for as he thinks about the cost , so he is . " eat and drink ! " he says to you , but his heart is not with you .
the morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up , and lose your good words .
Don 't speak in the ears of a fool , for he will despise the wisdom of your words .
Don 't move the ancient boundary stone . Don 't encroach on the fields of the fatherless :
for their Defender is strong . he will plead their case against you .
apply your heart to instruction , and your ears to the words of knowledge .
Don 't withhold correction from a child . if you punish him with the rod , he will not die .
punish him with the rod , and save his soul from Sheol .
my son , if your heart is wise , then my heart will be glad , even mine :
yes , my heart will rejoice , when your lips speak what is right .
Don 't let your heart envy sinners ; but rather fear Yahweh all the day long .
indeed surely there is a future hope , and your hope will not be cut off .
listen , my son , and be wise , and keep your heart on the right path !
Don 't be among ones drinking too much wine , or those who gorge themselves on meat :
for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor ; and drowsiness clothes them in rags .
listen to your father who gave you life , and don 't despise your mother when she is old .
buy the truth , and don 't sell it . get wisdom , discipline , and understanding .
the father of the righteous has great joy . whoever fathers a wise child delights in him .
let your father and your mother be glad ! let her who bore you rejoice !
my son , give me your heart ; and let your eyes keep in my ways .
for a prostitute is a deep pit ; and a wayward wife is a narrow well .
yes , she lies in wait like a robber , and increases the unfaithful among men .
who has woe ? who has sorrow ? who has strife ? who has complaints ? who has needless bruises ? who has bloodshot eyes ?
those who stay long at the wine ; those who go to seek out mixed wine .
Don 't look at the wine when it is red , when it sparkles in the cup , when it goes down smoothly .
in the end , it Bites like a snake , and poisons like a viper .
your eyes will see strange things , and your mind will imagine confusing things .
yes , you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea , or as he who lies on top of the rigging :
" they hit me , and I was not hurt ! they beat me , and I don 't feel it ! when will I wake up ? I can do it again . I can find another . "
Don 't be envious of evil men ; neither desire to be with them :
for their hearts plot violence , and their lips talk about mischief .
through wisdom a house is built ; by understanding it is established ;
by knowledge the rooms are filled with all rare and beautiful treasure .
for by wise guidance you wage your war ; and victory is in many advisors .
wisdom is too high for a fool : he doesn 't open his mouth in the gate .
one who plots to do evil will be called a schemer .
the schemes of Folly are sin . the mocker is detested by men .
if you falter in the time of trouble , your strength is small .
rescue those who are being led away to death ! indeed , hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter !
if you say , " behold , we didn 't know this " ; doesn 't he who weighs the hearts consider it ? he who keeps your soul , doesn 't he know it ? shall he not render to every man according to his work ?
my son , eat honey , for it is good ; the droppings of the honeycomb , which are sweet to your taste :
so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul ; if you have found it , then there will be a reward , your hope will not be cut off .
Don 't lay in wait , wicked man , against the habitation of the righteous . Don 't destroy his resting place :
for a righteous man falls seven times , and rises up again ; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity .
Don 't rejoice when your enemy falls . Don 't let your heart be glad when he is overthrown ;
lest Yahweh see it , and it displease him , and he turn away his wrath from him .
Don 't fret yourself because of evildoers ; neither be envious of the wicked :
for there will be no reward to the evil man ; and the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out .
my son , fear Yahweh and the king . Don 't join those who are rebellious :
for their calamity will rise suddenly ; the destruction from them both--who knows ?
these also are sayings of the wise . to show partiality in judgment is not good .
he who says to the wicked , " You are righteous " ; peoples shall curse him , and nations shall abhor him--
but it will go well with those who convict the guilty , and a rich blessing will come on them .
an honest answer is like a kiss on the lips .
prepare your work outside , and get your fields ready . afterwards , build your house .
Don 't be a witness against your neighbor without cause . Don 't deceive with your lips .
Don 't say , " I will do to him as he has done to me ; I will render to the man according to his work . "
I went by the field of the sluggard , by the vineyard of the man void of understanding ;
behold , it was all grown over with thorns . its surface was covered with nettles , and its stone wall was broken down .
then I saw , and considered well . I saw , and received instruction :
a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep ;
so your poverty will come as a robber , and your want as an armed man .
these also are Proverbs of Solomon , which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out .
it is the glory of God to conceal a thing , but the glory of kings is to search out a matter .
as the heavens for height , and the earth for depth , so the hearts of kings are unsearchable .
take away the dross from the silver , and material comes out for the refiner ;
take away the wicked from the king 's presence , and his throne will be established in righteousness .
Don 't exalt yourself in the presence of the king , or claim a place among great men ;
for it is better that it be said to you , " Come up here , " than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince , whom your eyes have seen .
Don 't be hasty in bringing charges to court . what will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you ?
debate your case with your neighbor , and don 't betray the confidence of another ;
lest one who hears it put you to shame , and your bad reputation never depart .
a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver .
as an earring of gold , and an ornament of fine gold , so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear .
as the cold of snow in the time of harvest , so is a faithful messenger to those who send him ; for he refreshes the soul of his masters .
as clouds and wind without rain , so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively .
by patience a ruler is persuaded . a soft tongue breaks the bone .
have you found honey ? eat as much as is sufficient for you , lest you eat too much , and vomit it .
let your foot be seldom in your neighbor 's house , lest he be weary of you , and hate you .
a man who gives false testimony against his neighbor is like a club , a sword , or a sharp arrow .
confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble is like a bad tooth , or a lame foot .
as one who takes away a garment in cold weather , or vinegar on soda , so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart .
if your enemy is hungry , give him food to eat . if he is thirsty , give him water to drink :
for you will heap coals of fire on his head , and Yahweh will reward you .
the north wind brings forth rain : so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face .
it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop , than to share a house with a contentious woman .
like cold water to a thirsty soul , so is good news from a far country .
like a muddied spring , and a polluted well , so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked .
it is not good to eat much honey ; nor is it honorable to seek one 's own honor .
like a city that is broken down and without walls is a man whose spirit is without restraint .
like snow in summer , and as rain in harvest , so honor is not fitting for a fool .
like a fluttering sparrow , like a darting swallow , so the undeserved curse doesn 't come to rest .
a whip is for the horse , a bridle for the donkey , and a rod for the back of fools !
Don 't answer a fool according to his Folly , lest you also be like him .
answer a fool according to his Folly , lest he be wise in his own eyes .
one who sends a message by the hand of a fool is cutting off feet and drinking violence .
like the legs of the lame that hang loose : so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
as one who binds a stone in a sling , so is he who gives honor to a fool .
like a thornbush that goes into the hand of a drunkard , so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
as an archer who wounds all , so is he who hires a fool or he who hires those who pass by .
as a dog that returns to his vomit , so is a fool who repeats his Folly .
do you see a man wise in his own eyes ? there is more hope for a fool than for him .
the sluggard says , " There is a lion in the road ! a fierce lion roams the streets ! "
as the door turns on its hinges , so does the sluggard on his bed .
the sluggard buries his hand in the dish . he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth .
the sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer with discretion .
like one who grabs a dog 's ears is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own .
like a madman who shoots torches , arrows , and death ,
for lack of wood a fire goes out . without gossip , a quarrel dies down .
as coals are to hot embers , and wood to fire , so is a contentious man to kindling strife .
the words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels , they go down into the innermost parts .
like silver dross on an earthen vessel are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart .
a malicious man disguises himself with his lips , but he harbors evil in his heart .
when his speech is charming , don 't believe him ; for there are seven abominations in his heart .
his malice may be concealed by deception , but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly .
whoever digs a pit shall fall into it . whoever rolls a stone , it will come back on him .
a lying tongue hates those it hurts ; and a flattering mouth works ruin .
Don 't boast about tomorrow ; for you don 't know what a day may bring forth .
let another man praise you , and not your own mouth ; a stranger , and not your own lips .
a stone is heavy , and sand is a burden ; but a fool 's provocation is heavier than both .
wrath is cruel , and anger is overwhelming ; but who is able to stand before jealousy ?
better is open rebuke than hidden love .
faithful are the wounds of a friend ; although the kisses of an enemy are profuse .
a full soul loathes a honeycomb ; but to a hungry soul , every bitter thing is sweet .
as a bird that wanders from her nest , so is a man who wanders from his home .
perfume and incense bring joy to the heart ; so does earnest counsel from a man 's friend .
Don 't forsake your friend and your father 's friend . Don 't go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother .
be wise , my son , and bring joy to my heart , then I can answer my tormentor .
a prudent man sees danger and takes refuge ; but the simple pass on , and suffer for it .
take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger . hold it for a wayward woman !
he who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning , it will be taken as a curse by him .
a continual dropping on a rainy day and a contentious wife are alike :
restraining her is like restraining the wind , or like grasping oil in his right hand .
iron sharpens iron ; so a man sharpens his friend 's countenance .
whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit . he who looks after his master shall be honored .
as water reflects a face , so a man 's heart reflects the man .
Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied ; and a man 's eyes are never satisfied .
though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain , yet his foolishness will not be removed from him .
know well the state of your flocks , and pay attention to your herds :
for riches are not forever , nor does even the crown endure to all generations .
the hay is removed , and the new growth appears , the grasses of the hills are gathered in .
the lambs are for your clothing , and the goats are the price of a field .
there will be plenty of goats ' milk for your food , for your family 's food , and for the nourishment of your servant girls .
the wicked flee when no one pursues ; but the righteous are as bold as a lion .
in rebellion , a land has many rulers , but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge .
a needy man who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain which leaves no crops .
those who forsake the law praise the wicked ; but those who keep the law contend with them .
evil men don 't understand justice ; but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully .
better is the poor who walks in his integrity , than he who is perverse in his ways , and he is rich .
whoever keeps the law is a wise son ; but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father .
he who increases his wealth by excessive interest gathers it for one who has pity on the poor .
he who turns away his ear from hearing the law , even his prayer is an abomination .
whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way , he will fall into his own trap ; but the blameless will inherit good .
the rich man is wise in his own eyes ; but the poor who has understanding sees through him .
when the righteous triumph , there is great glory ; but when the wicked rise , men hide themselves .
he who conceals his sins doesn 't prosper , but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy .
blessed is the man who always fears ; but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble .
as a roaring lion or a charging bear , so is a wicked ruler over helpless people .
a tyrannical ruler lacks judgment . one who hates ill @-@ gotten gain will have long days .
a man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death ; no one will support him .
whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe ; but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly .
one who works his land will have an abundance of food ; but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty .
a faithful man is rich with blessings ; but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished .
to show partiality is not good ; yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread .
a stingy man hurries after riches , and doesn 't know that poverty waits for him .
one who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than one who flatters with the tongue .
whoever robs his father or his mother , and says , " It 's not wrong . " he is a partner with a destroyer .
one who is greedy stirs up strife ; but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper .
one who trusts in himself is a fool ; but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe .
one who gives to the poor has no lack ; but one who closes his eyes will have many curses .
when the wicked rise , men hide themselves ; but when they perish , the righteous thrive .
he who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck will be destroyed suddenly , with no remedy .
when the righteous thrive , the people rejoice ; but when the wicked rule , the people groan .
whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father ; but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth .
the king by justice makes the land stable , but he who takes bribes tears it down .
a man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet .
an evil man is snared by his sin , but the righteous can sing and be glad .
the righteous care about justice for the poor . the wicked aren 't concerned about knowledge .
Mockers stir up a city , but wise men turn away anger .
if a wise man goes to court with a foolish man , the fool rages or scoffs , and there is no peace .
the bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity ; and they seek the life of the upright .
a fool vents all of his anger , but a wise man brings himself under control .
if a ruler listens to lies , all of his officials are wicked .
the poor man and the oppressor have this in common : Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both .
the king who fairly judges the poor , his throne shall be established forever .
the rod of correction gives wisdom , but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother .
when the wicked increase , sin increases ; but the righteous will see their downfall .
correct your son , and he will give you peace ; yes , he will bring delight to your soul .
where there is no revelation , the people cast off restraint ; but one who keeps the law is blessed .
a servant can 't be corrected by words . though he understands , yet he will not respond .
do you see a man who is hasty in his words ? there is more hope for a fool than for him .
he who pampers his servant from youth will have him become a son in the end .
an angry man stirs up strife , and a wrathful man abounds in sin .
a man 's pride brings him low , but one of lowly spirit gains honor .
whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul . he takes an oath , but dares not testify .
the fear of man proves to be a snare , but whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept safe .
many seek the ruler 's favor , but a man 's justice comes from Yahweh .
a dishonest man detests the righteous , and the upright in their ways detest the wicked .
" surely I am the most ignorant man , and don 't have a man 's understanding .
I have not learned wisdom , neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One .
" every word of God is flawless . he is a shield to those who take refuge in him .
Don 't you add to his words , lest he reprove you , and you be found a liar .
" two things I have asked of you ; don 't deny me before I die :
remove far from me falsehood and lies . give me neither poverty nor riches . feed me with the food that is needful for me ;
lest I be full , deny you , and say , ' Who is Yahweh ? ' or lest I be poor , and steal , and so dishonor the name of my God .
" Don 't slander a servant to his master , lest he curse you , and you be held guilty .
there is a generation that curses their father , and doesn 't bless their mother .
there is a generation that is pure in their own eyes , yet are not washed from their filthiness .
there is a generation , oh how lofty are their eyes ! their eyelids are lifted up .
there is a generation whose teeth are like swords , and their jaws like knives , to devour the poor from the earth , and the needy from among men .
" the leach has two daughters : ' give , give . ' " there are three things that are never satisfied ; four that don 't say , ' Enough : '
Sheol , the barren womb ; the earth that is not satisfied with water ; and the fire that doesn 't say , ' Enough . '
" the eye that mocks at his father , and scorns obedience to his mother : the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , the young eagles shall eat it .
" there are three things which are too amazing for me , four which I don 't understand :
the way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent on a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maiden .
" so is the way of an adulterous woman : she eats and wipes her mouth , and says , ' I have done nothing wrong . '
" for three things the earth tremble , and under four , it can 't bear up :
for a servant when he is king ; a fool when he is filled with food ;
for an unloved woman when she is married ; and a handmaid who is heir to her mistress .
" there are four things which are little on the earth , but they are exceedingly wise :
the ants are not a strong people , yet they provide their food in the summer .
the conies are but a feeble folk , yet make they their houses in the rocks .
the locusts have no king , yet they advance in ranks .
you can catch a lizard with your hands , yet it is in kings ' palaces .
" there are three things which are stately in their march , four which are stately in going :
the lion , which is mightiest among animals , and doesn 't turn away for any ;
the greyhound , the male goat also ; and the king against whom there is no rising up .
" if you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself , or if you have thought evil , put your hand over your mouth .
for as the churning of milk brings forth butter , and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood ; so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife . "
the words of king Lemuel ; the oracle which his mother taught him .
" Oh , my son ! Oh , son of my womb ! Oh , son of my vows !
Don 't give your strength to women , nor your ways to that which destroys kings .
it is not for kings , Lemuel ; it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for princes to say , ' Where is strong drink ? '
lest they drink , and forget the law , and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted .
give strong drink to him who is ready to perish ; and wine to the bitter in soul :
let him drink , and forget his poverty , and remember his misery no more .
open your mouth for the mute , in the cause of all who are left desolate .
open your mouth , judge righteously , and serve justice to the poor and needy . "
who can find a worthy woman ? for her price is far above rubies .
the heart of her husband trusts in her . he shall have no lack of gain .
she does him good , and not harm , all the days of her life .
she seeks wool and flax , and works eagerly with her hands .
she is like the merchant ships . she brings her bread from afar .
she rises also while it is yet night , gives food to her household , and portions for her servant girls .
she considers a field , and buys it . with the fruit of her hands , she plants a vineyard .
she arms her waist with strength , and makes her arms strong .
she perceives that her merchandise is profitable . her lamp doesn 't go out by night .
she lays her hands to the distaff , and her hands hold the spindle .
she opens her arms to the poor ; yes , she extends her hands to the needy .
she is not afraid of the snow for her household ; for all her household are clothed with scarlet .
she makes for herself carpets of tapestry . her clothing is fine linen and purple .
her husband is respected in the gates , when he sits among the elders of the land .
she makes linen garments and sells them , and delivers sashes to the merchant .
strength and dignity are her clothing . she laughs at the time to come .
she opens her mouth with wisdom . faithful instruction is on her tongue .
she looks well to the ways of her household , and doesn 't eat the bread of idleness .
her children rise up and call her blessed . her husband also praises her :
" many women do noble things , but you excel them all . "
charm is deceitful , and beauty is vain ; but a woman who fears Yahweh , she shall be praised .
give her of the fruit of her hands ! let her works praise her in the gates !
the words of the preacher , the son of David , king in Jerusalem :
" vanity of vanities , " says the preacher ; " vanity of vanities , all is vanity . "
what does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun ?
one generation goes , and another generation comes ; but the earth remains forever .
the sun also rises , and the sun goes down , and hurries to its place where it rises .
the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north . it turns around continually as it goes , and the wind returns again to its courses .
all the rivers run into the sea , yet the sea is not full . to the place where the rivers flow , there they flow again .
all things are full of weariness beyond uttering . the eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing .
that which has been is that which shall be ; and that which has been done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
is there a thing of which it may be said , " behold , this is new ? " it has been long ago , in the ages which were before us .
there is no memory of the former ; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come , among those that shall come after .
I , the preacher , was king over Israel in Jerusalem .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and behold , all is vanity and a chasing after wind .
that which is crooked can 't be made straight ; and that which is lacking can 't be counted .
I said to myself , " behold , I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem . yes , my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge . "
I applied my heart to know wisdom , and to know madness and Folly . I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind .
for in much wisdom is much grief ; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow .
I said in my heart , " Come now , I will test you with mirth : therefore enjoy pleasure " ; and behold , this also was vanity .
I made myself great works . I built myself houses . I planted myself vineyards .
I made myself gardens and parks , and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit .
I made myself pools of water , to water from it the forest where trees were reared .
I bought male servants and female servants , and had servants born in my house . I also had great possessions of herds and flocks , above all who were before me in Jerusalem ;
I also gathered silver and gold for myself , and the treasure of kings and of the provinces . I got myself male and female singers , and the delights of the sons of men--musical instruments , and that of all sorts .
so I was great , and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem . my wisdom also remained with me .
then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked , and at the labor that I had labored to do ; and behold , all was vanity and a chasing after wind , and there was no profit under the sun .
I turned myself to consider wisdom , madness , and Folly : for what can the king 's successor do ? just that which has been done long ago .
then I saw that wisdom excels Folly , as far as light excels darkness .
the wise man 's eyes are in his head , and the fool walks in darkness--and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all .
for of the wise man , even as of the fool , there is no memory for ever , since in the days to come all will have been long forgotten . indeed , the wise man must die just like the fool !
so I hated life , because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me ; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind .
I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun , because I must leave it to the man who comes after me .
who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool ? yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored , and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun . this also is vanity .
therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun .
for what has a man of all his labor , and of the striving of his heart , in which he labors under the sun ?
for all his days are sorrows , and his travail is grief ; yes , even in the night his heart takes no rest . this also is vanity .
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and make his soul enjoy good in his labor . this also I saw , that it is from the hand of God .
for everything there is a season , and a time for every purpose under heaven :
a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
a time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
a time to weep , and a time to laugh ; a time to mourn , and a time to dance ;
a time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ;
a time to seek , and a time to lose ; a time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
a time to tear , and a time to sew ; a time to keep silence , and a time to speak ;
a time to love , and a time to hate ; a time for war , and a time for peace .
what profit has he who works in that in which he labors ?
I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
he has made everything beautiful in its time . he has also set eternity in their hearts , yet so that man can 't find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end .
I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice , and to do good as long as they live .
also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy good in all his labor , is the gift of God .
I know that whatever God does , it shall be forever . nothing can be added to it , nor anything taken from it ; and God has done it , that men should fear before him .
that which is has been long ago , and that which is to be has been long ago : and God seeks again that which is passed away .
moreover I saw under the sun , in the place of justice , that wickedness was there ; and in the place of righteousness , that wickedness was there .
I said in my heart , " God will judge the righteous and the wicked ; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work . "
I said in my heart , " As for the sons of men , God tests them , so that they may see that they themselves are like animals .
all go to one place . all are from the dust , and all turn to dust again .
who knows the spirit of man , whether it goes upward , and the spirit of the animal , whether it goes downward to the earth ? "
then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold , the tears of those who were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive .
yes , better than them both is him who has not yet been , who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man 's neighbor . this also is vanity and a striving after wind .
the fool folds his hands together and ruins himself .
better is a handful , with quietness , than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind .
then I returned and saw vanity under the sun .
two are better than one , because they have a good reward for their labor .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but woe to him who is alone when he falls , and doesn 't have another to lift him up .
again , if two lie together , then they have warmth ; but how can one keep warm alone ?
if a man prevails against one who is alone , two shall withstand him ; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken .
better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn 't know how to receive admonition any more .
for out of prison he came forth to be king ; yes , even in his kingdom he was born poor .
I saw all the living who walk under the sun , that they were with the youth , the other , who succeeded him .
there was no end of all the people , even of all them over whom he was--yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him . surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind .
guard your steps when you go to God 's house ; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools , for they don 't know that they do evil .
Don 't be rash with your mouth , and don 't let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God ; for God is in heaven , and you on earth . therefore let your words be few .
for as a dream comes with a multitude of cares , so a fool 's speech with a multitude of words .
when you vow a vow to God , don 't defer to pay it ; for he has no pleasure in fools . pay that which you vow .
it is better that you should not vow , than that you should vow and not pay .
Don 't allow your mouth to lead you into sin . Don 't protest before the messenger that this was a mistake . why should God be angry at your voice , and destroy the work of your hands ?
for in the multitude of dreams there are vanities , as well as in many words : but you must fear God .
moreover the profit of the earth is for all . the king profits from the field .
he who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he who loves abundance , with increase : this also is vanity .
when goods increase , those who eat them are increased ; and what advantage is there to its owner , except to feast on them with his eyes ?
the sleep of a laboring man is sweet , whether he eats little or much ; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep .
as he came forth from his mother 's womb , naked shall he go again as he came , and shall take nothing for his labor , which he may carry away in his hand .
this also is a grievous evil , that in all points as he came , so shall he go . and what profit does he have who labors for the wind ?
all his days he also eats in darkness , he is frustrated , and has sickness and wrath .
for he shall not often reflect on the days of his life ; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart .
there is an evil which I have seen under the sun , and it is heavy on men :
for it comes in vanity , and departs in darkness , and its name is covered with darkness .
all the labor of man is for his mouth , and yet the appetite is not filled .
for what advantage has the wise more than the fool ? what has the poor man , that knows how to walk before the living ?
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire . this also is vanity and a chasing after wind .
whatever has been , its name was given long ago ; and it is known what man is ; neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he .
for there are many words that create vanity . what does that profit man ?
a good name is better than fine perfume ; and the day of death better than the day of one 's birth .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
sorrow is better than laughter ; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
for as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool . this also is vanity .
surely extortion makes the wise man foolish ; and a bribe destroys the understanding .
better is the end of a thing than its beginning . the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
Don 't be hasty in your spirit to be angry , for anger rests in the bosom of fools .
Don 't say , " Why were the former days better than these ? " for you do not ask wisely about this .
wisdom is as good as an inheritance . yes , it is more excellent for those who see the sun .
for wisdom is a defense , even as money is a defense ; but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it .
consider the work of God , for who can make that straight , which he has made crooked ?
in the day of prosperity be joyful , and in the day of adversity consider ; yes , God has made the one side by side with the other , to the end that man should not find out anything after him .
all this have I seen in my days of vanity : there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing .
Don 't be overly righteous , neither make yourself overly wise . why should you destroy yourself ?
Don 't be too wicked , neither be foolish . why should you die before your time ?
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don 't withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city .
surely there is not a righteous man on earth , who does good and doesn 't sin .
also don 't take heed to all words that are spoken , lest you hear your servant curse you ;
for often your own heart knows that you yourself have likewise Cursed others .
all this have I proved in wisdom . I said , " I will be wise " ; but it was far from me .
that which is , is far off and exceedingly deep . who can find it out ?
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things , and to know that wickedness is stupidity , and that foolishness is madness .
I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and traps , whose hands are chains . whoever pleases God shall escape from her ; but the sinner will be ensnared by her .
" behold , I have found this , " says the preacher , " one to another , to find out the scheme ;
which my soul still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
behold , this only have I found : that God made man upright ; but they search for many schemes . "
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom makes his face shine , and the hardness of his face is changed .
I say , " keep the king 's command ! " because of the oath to God .
Don 't be hasty to go out of his presence . Don 't persist in an evil thing , for he does whatever pleases him ,
for the king 's word is supreme . who can say to him , " What are you doing ? "
whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm , and his wise heart will know the time and procedure .
for there is a time and procedure for every purpose , although the misery of man is heavy on him .
for he doesn 't know that which will be ; for who can tell him how it will be ?
all this have I seen , and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun . there is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt .
so I saw the wicked buried . indeed they came also from holiness . they went and were forgotten in the city where they did this . this also is vanity .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times , and lives long , yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God , who are reverent before him .
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow ; because he doesn 't fear God .
there is a vanity which is done on the earth , that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked . again , there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous . I said that this also is vanity .
when I applied my heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done on the earth ( for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes ) ,
for to him who is joined with all the living there is hope ; for a living dog is better than a dead lion .
for the living know that they will die , but the dead don 't know anything , neither do they have any more a reward ; for their memory is forgotten .
also their love , their hatred , and their envy has perished long ago ; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun .
go your way--eat your bread with joy , and drink your wine with a merry heart ; for God has already accepted your works .
let your garments be always white , and don 't let your head lack oil .
whatever your hand finds to do , do it with your might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in Sheol , where you are going .
for man also doesn 't know his time . as the fish that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare , even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falls suddenly on them .
I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way , and it seemed great to me .
there was a little city , and few men within it ; and a great king came against it , besieged it , and built great bulwarks against it .
now a poor wise man was found in it , and he by his wisdom delivered the city ; yet no man remembered that same poor man .
then I said , " wisdom is better than strength . " nevertheless the poor man 's wisdom is despised , and his words are not heard .
the words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him who rules among fools .
wisdom is better than weapons of war ; but one sinner destroys much good .
dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor ; so does a little Folly outweigh wisdom and honor .
a wise man 's heart is at his right hand , but a fool 's heart at his left .
yes also , when the fool walks by the way , his understanding fails him , and he says to everyone that he is a fool .
if the spirit of the ruler rises up against you , don 't leave your place ; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest .
there is an evil which I have seen under the sun , the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler .
Folly is set in great dignity , and the rich sit in a low place .
I have seen servants on horses , and princes walking like servants on the earth .
he who digs a pit may fall into it ; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake .
whoever carves out stones may be injured by them . whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby .
if the axe is blunt , and one doesn 't sharpen the edge , then he must use more strength ; but skill brings success .
if the snake Bites before it is charmed , then is there no profit for the charmer 's tongue .
the words of a wise man 's mouth are gracious ; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips .
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness ; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
a fool also multiplies words . man doesn 't know what will be ; and that which will be after him , who can tell him ?
the labor of fools wearies every one of them ; for he doesn 't know how to go to the city .
Woe to you , land , when your king is a child , and your princes eat in the morning !
happy are you , land , when your king is the son of nobles , and your princes eat in due season , for strength , and not for drunkenness !
by slothfulness the roof sinks in ; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks .
a feast is made for laughter , and wine makes the life glad ; and money is the answer for all things .
Don 't curse the king , no , not in your thoughts ; and don 't curse the rich in your bedroom : for a bird of the sky may carry your voice , and that which has wings may tell the matter .
give a portion to seven , yes , even to eight ; for you don 't know what evil will be on the earth .
if the clouds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the earth ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
he who observes the wind won 't sow ; and he who regards the clouds won 't reap .
as you don 't know what is the way of the wind , nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child ; even so you don 't know the work of God who does all .
in the morning sow your seed , and in the evening don 't withhold your hand ; for you don 't know which will prosper , whether this or that , or whether they both will be equally good .
truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun .
yes , if a man lives many years , let him rejoice in them all ; but let him remember the days of darkness , for they shall be many . all that comes is vanity .
therefore remove sorrow from your heart , and put away evil from your flesh ; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are darkened ,
and the doors shall be shut in the street ; when the sound of the grinding is low , and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird , and all the daughters of music shall be brought low ;
before the silver cord is severed , or the golden bowl is broken , or the pitcher is broken at the spring , or the wheel broken at the cistern ,
and the dust returns to the earth as it was , and the spirit returns to God who gave it .
further , because the preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge . yes , he pondered , sought out , and set in order many Proverbs .
the preacher sought to find out acceptable words , and that which was written blamelessly , words of truth .
the words of the wise are like goads ; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies , which are given from one shepherd .
furthermore , my son , be admonished : of making many books there is no end ; and much study is a weariness of the flesh .
this is the end of the matter . all has been heard . fear God , and keep his commandments ; for this is the whole duty of man .
for God will bring every work into judgment , with every hidden thing , whether it is good , or whether it is evil .
the Song of songs , which is Solomon 's . beloved
let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth ; for your love is better than wine .
your oils have a pleasing fragrance . your name is oil poured forth , therefore the virgins love you .
I am dark , but lovely , you daughters of Jerusalem , like Kedar 's tents , like Solomon 's curtains .
Don 't stare at me because I am dark , because the sun has scorched me . my mother 's sons were angry with me . they made me keeper of the vineyards . I haven 't kept my own vineyard .
tell me , you whom my soul loves , where you graze your flock , where you rest them at noon ; For why should I be as one who is veiled beside the flocks of your companions ? Lover
if you don 't know , most beautiful among women , follow the tracks of the sheep . Graze your young goats beside the shepherds ' tents .
I have compared you , my love , to a steed in Pharaoh 's chariots .
your cheeks are beautiful with earrings , your neck with strings of jewels .
we will make you earrings of gold , with studs of silver . beloved
while the king sat at his table , my perfume spread its fragrance .
my beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh , that lies between my breasts .
my beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi . Lover
behold , you are beautiful , my love . behold , you are beautiful . your eyes are doves . beloved
behold , you are beautiful , my beloved , yes , pleasant ; and our couch is verdant . Lover
the beams of our house are cedars . our rafters are firs . beloved
I am a rose of Sharon , a Lily of the valleys . Lover
as a Lily among thorns , so is my love among the daughters . beloved
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , his fruit was sweet to my taste .
he brought me to the banquet hall . his banner over me is love .
strengthen me with raisins , refresh me with apples ; For I am faint with love .
his left hand is under my head . his right hand embraces me .
I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , or by the hinds of the field , that you not stir up , nor awaken love , until it so desires .
the voice of my beloved ! behold , he comes , leaping on the mountains , skipping on the hills .
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart . behold , he stands behind our wall ! he looks in at the windows . he glances through the lattice .
my beloved spoke , and said to me , " Rise up , my love , my beautiful one , and come away .
for , behold , the winter is past . the rain is over and gone .
the flowers appear on the earth . the time of the singing has come , and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land .
the fig tree ripens her green figs . the vines are in blossom . they give forth their fragrance . arise , my love , my beautiful one , and come away . " Lover
my dove in the clefts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountainside , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is sweet , and your face is lovely .
catch for us the foxes , the little foxes that spoil the vineyards ; for our vineyards are in blossom . beloved
my beloved is mine , and I am his . he browses among the lilies .
until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , turn , my beloved , and be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether .
by night on my bed , I sought him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn 't find him .
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn 't find him .
the watchmen who go about the city found me ; " Have you seen him whom my soul loves ? "
I had scarcely passed from them , when I found him whom my soul loves . I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother 's house , into the room of her who conceived me .
I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , or by the hinds of the field , that you not stir up , nor awaken love , until it so desires .
who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all spices of the merchant ?
behold , it is Solomon 's carriage ! sixty mighty men are around it , of the mighty men of Israel .
they all handle the sword , and are expert in war . every man has his sword on his thigh , because of fear in the night .
King Solomon made himself a carriage of the wood of Lebanon .
he made its pillars of silver , its bottom of gold , its seat of purple , its midst being paved with love , from the daughters of Jerusalem .
go forth , you daughters of Zion , and see king Solomon , with the crown with which his mother has crowned him , in the day of his weddings , in the day of the gladness of his heart . Lover
behold , you are beautiful , my love . behold , you are beautiful . your eyes are doves behind your veil . your hair is as a flock of goats , that descend from Mount Gilead .
your teeth are like a newly shorn flock , which have come up from the washing , where every one of them has twins . none is bereaved among them .
your lips are like scarlet thread . your mouth is lovely . your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil .
your neck is like David 's tower built for an armory , whereon a thousand shields hang , all the shields of the mighty men .
your two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe , which feed among the lilies .
until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , I will go to the mountain of myrrh , to the hill of frankincense .
you are all beautiful , my love . there is no spot in you .
come with me from Lebanon , my bride , with me from Lebanon . look from the top of Amana , from the top of Senir and Hermon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
you have ravished my heart , my sister , my bride . you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes , with one chain of your neck .
how beautiful is your love , my sister , my bride ! how much better is your love than wine ! the fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices !
your lips , my bride , drip like the honeycomb . honey and milk are under your tongue . the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
a locked up garden is my sister , my bride ; a locked up spring , a sealed fountain .
your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates , with precious fruits : henna with spikenard plants ,
spikenard and saffron , calamus and Cinnamon , with every kind of incense tree ; myrrh and aloes , with all the best spices ,
a fountain of gardens , a well of living waters , flowing streams from Lebanon . beloved
awake , north wind ; and come , you south ! blow on my garden , that its spices may flow out . let my beloved come into his garden , and taste his precious fruits . Lover
I have taken off my robe . indeed , must I put it on ? I have washed my feet . indeed , must I soil them ?
my beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening . my heart pounded for him .
I rose up to open for my beloved . my hands dripped with myrrh , my fingers with liquid myrrh , on the handles of the lock .
I opened to my beloved ; but my beloved left ; and had gone away . my heart went out when he spoke . I looked for him , but I didn 't find him . I called him , but he didn 't answer .
the watchmen who go about the city found me . they beat me . they bruised me . the keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me .
I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , If you find my beloved , that you tell him that I am faint with love . friends
how is your beloved better than another beloved , you fairest among women ? how is your beloved better than another beloved , that you do so adjure us ? beloved
my beloved is white and ruddy . the best among ten thousand .
his head is like the purest gold . his hair is bushy , black as a raven .
his eyes are like doves beside the water brooks , washed with milk , mounted like jewels .
his cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes . his lips are like lilies , dropping liquid myrrh .
his hands are like rings of gold set with beryl . his body is like Ivory work overlaid with sapphires .
his legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold . his appearance is like Lebanon , excellent as the cedars .
his mouth is sweetness ; yes , he is altogether lovely . this is my beloved , and this is my friend , daughters of Jerusalem . friends
where has your beloved gone , you fairest among women ? where has your beloved turned , that we may seek him with you ? beloved
my beloved has gone down to his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
I am my beloved 's , and my beloved is mine . he browses among the lilies ,
you are beautiful , my love , as Tirzah , lovely as Jerusalem , awesome as an army with banners .
turn away your eyes from me , for they have overcome me . your hair is like a flock of goats , that lie along the side of Gilead .
your teeth are like a flock of ewes , which have come up from the washing ; of which every one has twins ; none is bereaved among them .
your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil .
there are sixty queens , eighty concubines , and virgins without number .
who is she who looks forth as the morning , beautiful as the moon , clear as the sun , and awesome as an army with banners ?
I went down into the nut tree grove , to see the green plants of the valley , to see whether the vine budded , and the pomegranates were in flower .
without realizing it , my desire set me with my royal people 's chariots . friends
return , return , Shulammite ! return , return , that we may gaze at you . Lover Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite , as at the dance of Mahanaim ?
how beautiful are your feet in sandals , prince 's daughter ! your rounded thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a skillful workman .
your body is like a round goblet , no mixed wine is wanting . your waist is like a heap of wheat , set about with lilies .
your two breasts are like two fawns , that are twins of a roe .
your neck is like an Ivory tower . your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim . your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus .
your head on you is like Carmel . the hair of your head like purple . the king is held captive in its tresses .
how beautiful and how pleasant you are , love , for delights !
this , your stature , is like a palm tree , your breasts like its fruit .
I said , " I will climb up into the palm tree . I will take hold of its fruit . " let your breasts be like clusters of the vine , the smell of your breath like apples , beloved
your mouth like the best wine , that goes down smoothly for my beloved , gliding through the lips of those who are asleep .
I am my beloved 's . his desire is toward me .
come , my beloved , let us go forth into the field . let us lodge in the villages .
let 's go early up to the vineyards . let 's see whether the vine has budded , its blossom is open , and the pomegranates are in flower . there I will give you my love .
the mandrakes give forth fragrance . at our doors are all kinds of precious fruits , new and old , which I have stored up for you , my beloved .
Oh that you were like my brother , who nursed from the breasts of my mother ! if I found you outside , I would kiss you ; yes , and no one would despise me .
I would lead you , bringing you into my mother 's house , who would instruct me . I would have you drink spiced wine , of the juice of my pomegranate .
his left hand would be under my head . his right hand would embrace me .
I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , that you not stir up , nor awaken love , until it so desires . friends
who is this who comes up from the wilderness , leaning on her beloved ? under the apple tree I aroused you . there your mother conceived you . there she was in labor and bore you .
set me as a seal on your heart , as a seal on your arm ; for love is strong as death . Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol . its flashes are flashes of fire , a very flame of Yahweh .
many waters can 't quench love , neither can floods drown it . if a man would give all the wealth of his house for love , he would be utterly scorned . friends
we have a little sister . she has no breasts . what shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for ?
if she is a wall , we will build on her a turret of silver. if she is a door , we will enclose her with boards of cedar . beloved
I am a wall , and my breasts like towers , then I was in his eyes like one who found peace .
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon . he leased out the vineyard to keepers . each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit .
my own vineyard is before me . the thousand are for you , Solomon ; two hundred for those who tend its fruit . Lover
you who dwell in the gardens , with friends in attendance , let me hear your voice ! beloved
come away , my beloved ! be like a gazelle or a young Stag on the mountains of spices !
the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
hear , heavens , and listen , earth ; for Yahweh has spoken : " I have nourished and brought up children , and they have rebelled against me .
the ox knows his owner , and the donkey his master 's crib ; but Israel doesn 't know , my people don 't consider . "
Ah sinful nation , a people loaded with iniquity , a seed of evildoers , children who deal corruptly ! they have forsaken Yahweh . they have despised the Holy One of Israel . they are estranged and backward .
why should you be beaten more , that you revolt more and more ? the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
from the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it : wounds , welts , and open sores . they haven 't been closed , neither bandaged , neither soothed with oil .
your country is desolate . your cities are burned with fire . Strangers devour your land in your presence , and it is desolate , as overthrown by strangers .
the daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard , like a hut in a field of melons , like a besieged city .
unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant , we would have been as Sodom ; we would have been like Gomorrah .
hear the word of Yahweh , you rulers of Sodom ! listen to the law of our God , you people of Gomorrah !
when you come to appear before me , who has required this at your hand , to trample my courts ?
bring no more vain offerings . Incense is an abomination to me ; new moons , Sabbaths , and convocations : I can 't bear with evil assemblies .
my soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts . they are a burden to me . I am weary of bearing them .
when you spread forth your hands , I will hide my eyes from you . yes , when you make many prayers , I will not hear . your hands are full of blood .
wash yourselves , make yourself clean . put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes . cease to do evil .
learn to do well . seek justice . relieve the oppressed . judge the fatherless . plead for the widow . "
if you are willing and obedient , you shall eat the good of the land ;
but if you refuse and rebel , you shall be devoured with the sword ; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it . "
how the faithful city has become a prostitute ! she was full of justice ; righteousness lodged in her , but now murderers .
your princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves . everyone loves bribes , and follows after rewards . they don 't judge the fatherless , neither does the cause of the widow come to them .
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , the mighty One of Israel , says : " Ah , I will get relief from my adversaries , and avenge myself of my enemies ;
and I will turn my hand on you , thoroughly purge away your dross , and will take away all your tin .
I will restore your judges as at the first , and your counselors as at the beginning . afterward you shall be called ' The city of righteousness , a faithful town . '
Zion shall be redeemed with justice , and her converts with righteousness .
but the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together , and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed .
for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired , and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen .
for you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades , and as a garden that has no water .
the strong will be like tinder , and his work like a spark . they will both burn together , and no one will quench them . "
this is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem .
it shall happen in the latter days , that the mountain of Yahweh 's house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be raised above the hills ; and all nations shall flow to it .
he will judge between the nations , and will decide concerning many peoples ; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks . nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
house of Jacob , come , and let us walk in the light of Yahweh .
for you have forsaken your people , the house of Jacob , because they are filled from the east , with those who practice divination like the Philistines , and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots .
their land also is full of idols . they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
man is brought low , and mankind is humbled ; therefore don 't forgive them .
enter into the rock , and hide in the dust , from before the terror of Yahweh , and from the glory of his majesty .
the lofty looks of man will be brought low , the haughtiness of men will be bowed down , and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day .
for there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and haughty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
for all the cedars of Lebanon , that are high and lifted up , for all the oaks of Bashan ,
for all the high mountains , for all the hills that are lifted up ,
for every lofty tower , for every fortified wall ,
for all the ships of Tarshish , and for all pleasant imagery .
the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low ; and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day .
the idols shall utterly pass away .
stop trusting in man , whose breath is in his nostrils ; for of what account is he ?
I will give boys to be their princes , and children shall rule over them .
the people will be oppressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neighbor . the child will behave himself proudly against the old man , and the base against the honorable .
indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father , saying , " You have clothing , you be our ruler , and let this ruin be under your hand . "
in that day he will cry out , saying , " I will not be a healer ; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing . you shall not make me ruler of the people . "
for Jerusalem is ruined , and Judah is fallen ; because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh , to provoke the eyes of his glory .
the look of their faces testify against them . they parade their sin like Sodom . they don 't hide it . Woe to their soul ! for they have brought disaster upon themselves .
tell the righteous " Good ! " for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds .
Woe to the wicked ! disaster is upon them ; for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him .
Yahweh stands up to contend , and stands to judge the peoples .
moreover Yahweh said , " Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes , walking to trip as they go , jingling ornaments on their feet ;
therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion , and Yahweh will make their scalps bald . "
it shall happen that instead of sweet spices , there shall be rottenness ; instead of a belt , a rope ; instead of well set hair , baldness ; instead of a robe , a wearing of sackcloth ; and branding instead of beauty .
your men shall fall by the sword , and your mighty in the war .
her gates shall lament and mourn ; and she shall be desolate and sit on the ground .
in that day , Yahweh 's branch will be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel .
it will happen , that he who is left in Zion , and he who remains in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem ;
when the Lord shall have washed away the Filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst , by the spirit of justice , and by the spirit of burning .
there will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat , and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain .
let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard . my beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill .
" now , inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah , please judge between me and my vineyard .
what could have been done more to my vineyard , that I have not done in it ? why , when I looked for it to yield grapes , did it yield wild grapes ?
now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard . I will take away its hedge , and it will be eaten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be trampled down .
I will lay it a wasteland . it won 't be pruned nor hoed , but it will grow briers and thorns . I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it . "
for the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel , and the men of Judah his pleasant plant : and he looked for justice , but , behold , oppression ; for righteousness , but , behold , a cry of distress .
Woe to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land !
in my ears , Yahweh of Armies says : " surely many houses will be desolate , even great and beautiful , unoccupied .
for ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath , and a Homer of seed shall yield an ephah . "
Woe to those who rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; who stay late into the night , until wine inflames them !
the harp , Lyre , tambourine , and flute , with wine , are at their feasts ; but they don 't respect the work of Yahweh , neither have they considered the operation of his hands .
therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge . their honorable men are famished , and their multitudes are parched with thirst .
therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire , and opened its mouth without measure ; and their glory , their multitude , their pomp , and he who rejoices among them , descend into it .
so man is brought low , mankind is humbled , and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled ;
but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice , and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness .
then the lambs will graze as in their pasture , and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich .
Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood , and wickedness as with cart rope ;
who say , " Let him make speed , let him hasten his work , that we may see it ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
Woe to those who call evil good , and good evil ; who put darkness for light , and light for darkness ; who put bitter for sweet , and sweet for bitter !
Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes , and prudent in their own sight !
Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine , and champions at mixing strong drink ;
he will lift up a banner to the nations from far , and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth . behold , they will come speedily and swiftly .
none shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the belt of their waist be untied , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken :
whose arrows are sharp , and all their bows bent . their horses ' hoofs will be like Flint , and their wheels like a whirlwind .
their roaring will be like a lioness . they will roar like young lions . yes , they shall roar , and seize their prey and carry it off , and there will be no one to deliver .
they will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea . if one looks to the land behold , darkness and distress . the light is darkened in its clouds .
in the year that king Uzziah died , I saw the Lord sitting on a throne , high and lifted up ; and his train filled the temple .
above him stood the seraphim . each one had six wings . with two he covered his face . with two he covered his feet . with two he flew .
one called to another , and said , " Holy , holy , holy , is Yahweh of Armies ! the whole earth is full of his glory ! "
the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called , and the house was filled with smoke .
then one of the seraphim flew to me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar .
he touched my mouth with it , and said , " behold , this has touched your lips ; and your iniquity is taken away , and your sin forgiven . "
I heard the Lord 's voice , saying , " whom shall I send , and who will go for us ? " then I said , " Here I am . send me ! "
he said , " Go , and tell this people , ' You hear indeed , but don 't understand ; and you see indeed , but don 't perceive . '
make the heart of this people fat . make their ears heavy , and shut their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and turn again , and be healed . "
and Yahweh has removed men far away , and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land .
if there is a tenth left in it , that also will in turn be consumed : as a terebinth , and as an oak , whose stock remains when they are felled ; so the holy seed is its stock . "
it happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up to Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
it was told the house of David , saying , " Syria is allied with Ephraim . " his heart trembled , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind .
then Yahweh said to Isaiah , " Go out now to meet Ahaz , you , and Shearjashub your son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool , on the highway of the fuller 's field .
because Syria , Ephraim , and the son of Remaliah , have plotted evil against you , saying ,
" let 's go up against Judah , and tear it apart , and let 's divide it among ourselves , and set up a king in its midst , even the son of Tabeel . "
this is what the Lord Yahweh says : " it shall not stand , neither shall it happen . "
for the head of Syria is Damascus , and the head of Damascus is Rezin ; and within sixty @-@ five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces , so that it shall not be a people ;
and the head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is Remaliah 's son . if you will not believe , surely you shall not be established . ' "
" ask a sign of Yahweh your God ; ask it either in the depth , or in the height above . "
but Ahaz said , " I will not ask , neither will I tempt Yahweh . "
he said , " listen now , house of David . is it not enough for you to try the patience of men , that you will try the patience of my God also ?
therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign . behold , the virgin will conceive , and bear a son , and shall call his name Immanuel .
he shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil , and choose the good .
for before the child knows to refuse the evil , and choose the good , the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken .
Yahweh will bring on you , on your people , and on your father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria .
it will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
they shall come , and shall all rest in the desolate valleys , in the clefts of the rocks , on all Thorn hedges , and on all pastures .
in that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River , even with the king of Assyria , the head and the hair of the feet ; and it shall also consume the beard .
it shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two sheep ;
and it shall happen , that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter : for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left in the midst of the land .
it will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels , shall be for briers and thorns .
people will go there with arrows and with bow , because all the land will be briers and thorns .
all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe , you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of sheep . "
Yahweh said to me , " Take a large tablet , and write on it with a man 's pen , ' For Maher Shalal hash Baz ; '
and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify : Uriah the priest , and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah . "
I went to the prophetess , and she conceived , and bore a son . then Yahweh said to me , " Call his name ' Maher Shalal hash Baz . '
for before the child knows how to say , ' My father , ' and , ' My mother , ' the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria . "
" because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly , and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah 's son ;
now therefore , behold , the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River : the king of Assyria and all his glory . it will come up over all its channels , and go over all its banks .
make an uproar , you peoples , and be broken in pieces ! listen , all you from far countries : dress for battle , and be shattered ! dress for battle , and be shattered !
take counsel together , and it will be brought to nothing ; speak the word , and it will not stand : for God is with us . "
for Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people , saying ,
" Don 't say , ' A conspiracy ! ' concerning all about which this people say , ' A conspiracy ! ' neither fear their threats , nor be terrorized .
Yahweh of Armies is who you must respect as holy . he is the one you must fear . he is the one you must dread .
he will be a sanctuary , but for both houses of Israel , he will be a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
many will stumble over it , fall , be broken , be snared , and be captured . "
wrap up the testimony . seal the law among my disciples .
I will wait for Yahweh , who hides his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
behold , I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies , who dwells in Mount Zion .
when they tell you , " consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards , who chirp and who mutter : " shouldn 't a people consult with their God ? should they consult the dead on behalf of the living ?
turn to the law and to the testimony ! if they don 't speak according to this word , surely there is no morning for them .
they will pass through it , very distressed and hungry ; and it will happen that when they are hungry , they will worry , and curse by their king and by their God . they will turn their faces upward ,
and look to the earth , and see distress , darkness , and the gloom of anguish . they will be driven into thick darkness .
the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light . those who lived in the land of the shadow of death , on them the light has shined .
you have multiplied the nation . you have increased their joy . they rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest , as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
for the yoke of his burden , and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , you have broken as in the day of Midian .
for all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle , and the garments rolled in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
for to us a child is born . to us a son is given ; and the government will be on his shoulders . his name will be called Wonderful , counselor , mighty God , Everlasting Father , Prince of Peace .
the Lord sent a word into Jacob , and it falls on Israel .
all the people will know , including Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria , who say in pride and in arrogance of heart ,
" the bricks have fallen , but we will build with cut stone . the sycamore fig trees have been cut down , but we will put cedars in their place . "
yet the people have not turned to him who struck them , neither have they sought Yahweh of Armies .
therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail , palm branch and Reed , in one day .
the elder and the honorable man is the head , and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail .
for those who lead this people lead them astray ; and those who are led by them are destroyed .
for wickedness burns like a fire . it devours the briers and thorns ; yes , it kindles in the thickets of the forest , and they roll upward in a column of smoke .
through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies , the land is burnt up ; and the people are the fuel for the fire . no one spares his brother .
one will devour on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he will eat on the left hand , and they will not be satisfied . everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm :
Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees , and to the writers who write oppressive decrees ;
what will you do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which will come from afar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
they will only bow down under the prisoners , and will fall under the slain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
Alas Assyrian , the rod of my anger , the staff in whose hand is my indignation !
however he doesn 't mean so , neither does his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy , and to cut off not a few nations .
for he says , " Aren 't all of my princes kings ?
as my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols , whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria ;
shall I not , as I have done to Samaria and her idols , so do to Jerusalem and her idols ?
therefore it will happen that , when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria , and the insolence of his haughty looks .
should an axe brag against him who chops with it ? should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it ? as if a rod should lift those who lift it up , or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood .
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , will send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire .
the light of Israel will be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame ; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day .
he will consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body . it will be as when a standard bearer faints .
the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few , so that a child could write their number .
it will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel , and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them , but shall lean on Yahweh , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
a remnant will return , even the remnant of Jacob , to the mighty God .
for though your people , Israel , are like the sand of the sea , only a remnant of them will return . a destruction is determined , overflowing with righteousness .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation against you will be accomplished , and my anger will be directed to his destruction . "
it will happen in that day , that his burden will depart from off your shoulder , and his yoke from off your neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil .
he has come to Aiath . he has passed through Migron . at Michmash he stores his baggage .
they have gone over the pass . they have taken up their lodging at Geba . Ramah trembles . Gibeah of Saul has fled .
cry aloud with your voice , daughter of Gallim ! listen , Laishah ! you poor Anathoth !
Madmenah is a fugitive . the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety .
this very day he will halt at Nob . he shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion , the hill of Jerusalem .
behold , the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , will lop the boughs with terror . the tall will be cut down , and the lofty will be brought low .
he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron , and Lebanon will fall by the mighty One .
a shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse , and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit .
the Spirit of Yahweh will rest on him : the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh .
his delight will be in the fear of Yahweh . he will not judge by the sight of his eyes , neither decide by the hearing of his ears ;
but with righteousness he will judge the poor , and decide with equity for the humble of the earth . he will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth ; and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked .
Righteousness will be the belt of his waist , and faithfulness the belt of his waist .
the wolf will live with the lamb , and the Leopard will lie down with the young goat ; The calf , the young lion , and the fattened calf together ; and a little child will lead them .
the cow and the bear will graze . their young ones will lie down together . the lion will eat straw like the ox .
the nursing child will play near a Cobra 's hole , and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper 's den .
they will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain ; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh , as the waters cover the sea .
it will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse , who stands as a banner of the peoples ; and his resting place will be glorious .
he will set up a banner for the nations , and will assemble the outcasts of Israel , and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth .
the envy also of Ephraim will depart , and those who persecute Judah will be cut off . Ephraim won 't envy Judah , and Judah won 't persecute Ephraim .
they will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west . together they will plunder the children of the east . they will extend their power over Edom and Moab , and the children of Ammon will obey them .
in that day you will say , " I will give thanks to you , Yahweh ; for though you were angry with me , your anger has turned away and you comfort me .
behold , God is my salvation . I will trust , and will not be afraid ; for Yah , Yahweh , is my strength and song ; and he has become my salvation . "
therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation .
in that day you will say , " Give thanks to Yahweh ! call on his name . declare his doings among the peoples . proclaim that his name is exalted !
sing to Yahweh , for he has done excellent things ! let this be known in all the earth !
cry aloud and shout , you inhabitant of Zion ; for the Holy One of Israel is great in the midst of you ! "
the burden of Babylon , which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw :
set up a banner on the bare mountain ! lift up your voice to them ! wave your hand , that they may go into the gates of the nobles .
I have commanded my consecrated ones ; yes , I have called my mighty men for my anger , even my proudly exulting ones .
the noise of a multitude is in the mountains , as of a great people ; the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together ! Yahweh of Armies is mustering the army for the battle .
they come from a far country , from the uttermost part of heaven , even Yahweh , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
Wail ; for the day of Yahweh is at hand ! it will come as destruction from the Almighty .
therefore all hands will be feeble , and everyone 's heart will melt .
they will be dismayed . pangs and sorrows will seize them . they will be in pain like a woman in labor . they will look in amazement one at another . their faces will be faces of flame .
behold , the day of Yahweh comes , cruel , with wrath and fierce anger ; to make the land a desolation , and to destroy its sinners out of it .
for the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light . the sun will be darkened in its going forth , and the moon will not cause its light to shine .
I will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their iniquity . I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease , and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible .
I will make people more rare than fine gold , even a person than the pure gold of Ophir .
therefore I will make the heavens tremble , and the earth will be shaken out of its place in the wrath of Yahweh of Armies , and in the day of his fierce anger .
it will happen that like a hunted gazelle , and like sheep that no one gathers , they will each turn to their own people , and will each flee to their own land .
everyone who is found will be thrust through . everyone who is captured will fall by the sword .
their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes . their houses will be ransacked , and their wives raped .
behold , I will stir up the Medes against them , who will not value silver , and as for gold , they will not delight in it .
their bows will dash the young men in pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb . their eyes will not spare children .
Babylon , the glory of kingdoms , the beauty of the Chaldeans ' pride , will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Arabian will not pitch a tent there , neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there .
but wild animals of the desert will lie there , and their houses will be full of jackals . Ostriches will dwell there , and wild goats will frolic there .
Wolves will cry in their castles , and jackals in the pleasant palaces . her time is near to come , and her days will not be prolonged .
for Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land . the foreigner will join himself with them , and they will unite with the house of Jacob .
the peoples will take them , and bring them to their place . the house of Israel will possess them in Yahweh 's land for servants and for handmaids . they will take as captives those whose captives they were ; and they shall rule over their oppressors .
it will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
that you will take up this parable against the king of Babylon , and say , " How the oppressor has ceased ! the golden city has ceased ! "
Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked , the scepter of the rulers ,
who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke , who ruled the nations in anger , with a persecution that none restrained .
the whole earth is at rest , and is quiet . they break out song .
yes , the fir trees rejoice with you , with the cedars of Lebanon , saying , " Since you are humbled , no lumberjack has come up against us . "
they all will answer and ask you , " Have you also become as weak as we are ? have you become like us ? "
your pomp is brought down to Sheol , with the sound of your stringed instruments . Maggots are spread out under you , and worms cover you .
how you have fallen from heaven , morning star , son of the dawn ! how you are cut down to the ground , who laid the nations low !
you said in your heart , " I will ascend into heaven ! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God ! I will sit on the mountain of assembly , in the far north !
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds ! I will make myself like the Most High ! "
yet you shall be brought down to Sheol , to the depths of the pit .
all the kings of the nations , sleep in glory , everyone in his own house .
you will not join them in burial , because you have destroyed your land . you have killed your people . the seed of evildoers will not be named forever .
prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their fathers , that they not rise up and possess the earth , and fill the surface of the world with cities .
" I will rise up against them , " says Yahweh of Armies , " and cut off from Babylon name and remnant , and son and son 's son , " says Yahweh .
" I will also make it a possession for the porcupine , and pools of water . I will sweep it with the Broom of destruction , " says Yahweh of Armies .
Yahweh of Armies has sworn , saying , " surely , as I have thought , so shall it happen ; and as I have purposed , so shall it stand :
that I will break the Assyrian in my land , and tread him under foot on my mountains . then his yoke will leave them , and his burden leave their shoulders .
this is the plan that is determined for the whole earth . this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations .
for Yahweh of Armies has planned , and who can stop it ? his hand is stretched out , and who can turn it back ? "
this burden was in the year that king Ahaz died .
Don 't rejoice , O Philistia , all of you , because the rod that struck you is broken ; for out of the serpent 's root an adder will emerge , and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent .
the firstborn of the poor will eat , and the needy will lie down in safety ; and I will kill your root with famine , and your remnant will be killed .
what will they answer the messengers of the nation ? that Yahweh has founded Zion , and in her the afflicted of his people will take refuge .
the burden of Moab : for in a night , Ar of Moab is laid waste , and brought to nothing ; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste , and brought to nothing .
they have gone up to Bayith , and to Dibon , to the high places , to weep . Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba . Baldness is on all of their heads . every beard is cut off .
in their streets , they clothe themselves in sackcloth . in their streets and on their housetops , everyone wails , weeping abundantly .
Heshbon cries out with Elealeh . their voice is heard even to Jahaz . therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud . their souls tremble within them .
my heart cries out for Moab ! her nobles flee to Zoar , to Eglath Shelishiyah ; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping ; for in the way of Horonaim , they raise up a cry of destruction .
for the waters of Nimrim will be desolate ; for the grass has withered away , the tender grass fails , there is no green thing .
therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have stored up , over the Brook of the willows .
for the cry has gone around the borders of Moab ; its wailing to Eglaim , and its wailing to Beer Elim .
for the waters of Dimon are full of blood ; for I will bring yet more on Dimon , a lion on those of Moab who escape , and on the remnant of the land .
send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness , to the mountain of the daughter of Zion .
for it will be that as wandering birds , as a scattered nest , so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon .
give counsel ! execute justice ! make your shade like the night in the midst of the noonday ! hide the outcasts ! Don 't betray the fugitive !
a throne will be established in loving kindness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , judging , seeking justice , and swift to do righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Moab , that he is very proud ; even of his arrogance , his pride , and his wrath . his boastings are nothing .
therefore Moab will wail for Moab . everyone will wail . you will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth , utterly stricken .
for the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah . the lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches , which reached even to Jazer , which wandered into the wilderness . its shoots were spread abroad . they passed over the sea .
therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah . I will water you with my tears , Heshbon , and Elealeh : for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen .
therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab , and my inward parts for Kir Heres .
it will happen that when Moab presents himself , when he wearies himself on the high place , and comes to his sanctuary to pray , that he will not prevail .
this is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past .
the burden of Damascus : " behold , Damascus is taken away from being a city , and it will be a ruinous heap .
the cities of Aroer are forsaken . they will be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the fortress shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria . they will be as the glory of the children of Israel , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" it will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh will become lean .
it will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat , and his arm reaps the grain . yes , it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim .
in that day , people will look to their Maker , and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel .
they will not look to the altars , the work of their hands ; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made , either the Asherim , or the incense altars .
in that day , their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top , which were forsaken from before the children of Israel ; and it will be a desolation .
in the day of your planting , you hedge it in . in the morning , you make your seed blossom , but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
Ah , the uproar of many peoples , who roar like the roaring of the seas ; and the rushing of nations , that rush like the rushing of mighty waters !
the nations will rush like the rushing of many waters : but he will rebuke them , and they will flee far off , and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like the whirling dust before the storm .
at evening , behold , terror ! before the morning , they are no more . this is the portion of those who plunder us , and the lot of those who rob us .
Ah , the land of the rustling of wings , which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia ;
all you inhabitants of the world , and you dwellers on the earth , when a banner is lifted up on the mountains , look ! when the trumpet is blown , listen !
for before the harvest , when the blossom is over , and the flower becomes a ripening grape , he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks , and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches .
they will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains , and for the animals of the earth . the ravenous birds will summer on them , and all the animals of the earth will winter on them .
the burden of Egypt : " behold , Yahweh rides on a swift cloud , and comes to Egypt . the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence ; and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst .
I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians , and they will fight everyone against his brother , and everyone against his neighbor ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
the spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst . I will destroy its counsel . they will seek the idols , the charmers , those who have familiar spirits , and the wizards .
I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord . a fierce king will rule over them , " says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies .
the waters will fail from the sea , and the river will be wasted and become dry .
the rivers will become foul . the streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up . the reeds and flags will wither away .
the meadows by the Nile , by the brink of the Nile , and all the sown fields of the Nile , will become dry , be driven away , and be no more .
the fishermen will lament , and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn , and those who spread nets on the waters will languish .
moreover those who work in combed flax , and those who weave white cloth , will be confounded .
the pillars will be broken in pieces . all those who work for hire will be grieved in soul .
where then are your wise men ? let them tell you now ; and let them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt .
the princes of Zoan have become fools . the princes of Memphis are deceived . they have caused Egypt to go astray , who are the cornerstone of her tribes .
Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works , like a drunken man staggers in his vomit .
neither shall there be any work for Egypt , which head or tail , palm branch or rush , may do .
in that day the Egyptians will be like women . they will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Armies , which he shakes over them .
the land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt . everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid , because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies , which he determines against it .
in that day , there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar to Yahweh at its border .
it will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt ; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors , and he will send them a Savior and a defender , and he will deliver them .
Yahweh will be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day . yes , they will worship with sacrifice and offering , and will vow a vow to Yahweh , and will perform it .
Yahweh will strike Egypt , striking and healing . they will return to Yahweh , and he will be entreated by them , and will heal them .
in that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria , and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into Assyria ; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians .
because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them , saying , " blessed be Egypt my people , Assyria the work of my hands , and Israel my inheritance . "
Yahweh said , " As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia ,
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia , young and old , naked and barefoot , and with buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
they will be dismayed and confounded , because of Ethiopia their expectation , and of Egypt their glory .
the burden of the wilderness of the sea . as whirlwinds in the South sweep through , it comes from the wilderness , from an awesome land .
therefore my thighs are filled with anguish . pains have taken hold on me , like the pains of a woman in labor . I am in so much pain that I can 't hear . I so am dismayed that I can 't see .
my heart flutters . horror has frightened me . the twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me .
they prepare the table . they set the watch . they eat . they drink . rise up , you princes , oil the shield !
for the Lord said to me , " Go , set a watchman . let him declare what he sees .
when he sees a troop , horsemen in pairs , a troop of donkeys , a troop of camels , he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness . "
he cried like a lion : " Lord , I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime , and every night I stay at my post .
behold , here comes a troop of men , horsemen in pairs . " he answered , " fallen , fallen is Babylon ; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground .
you are my threshing , and the grain of my floor ! " that which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , I have declared to you .
the watchman said , " The morning comes , and also the night . if you will inquire , inquire . come back again . "
the burden on Arabia . in the forest in Arabia you will lodge , you caravans of Dedanites .
they brought water to him who was thirsty . the inhabitants of the land of TEMA met the fugitives with their bread .
for they fled away from the swords , from the drawn sword , from the bent bow , and from the heat of battle .
for the Lord said to me , " Within a year , as a worker bound by contract would count it , all the glory of Kedar will fail ,
and the residue of the number of the archers , the mighty men of the children of Kedar , will be few ; for Yahweh , the God of Israel , has spoken it . "
all your rulers fled away together . they were bound by the archers . all who were found by you were bound together . they fled far away .
therefore I said , " Look away from me . I will weep bitterly . Don 't labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Elam carried his quiver , with chariots of men and horsemen ; and Kir uncovered the shield .
it happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots , and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate .
he took away the covering of Judah ; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest .
you saw the breaches of the city of David , that they were many ; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
you numbered the houses of Jerusalem , and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall .
you also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool . but you didn 't look to him who had done this , neither did you have respect for him who purposed it long ago .
in that day , the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , called to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to dressing in sackcloth :
and behold , joy and gladness , killing cattle and killing sheep , eating flesh and drinking wine : " let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we will die . "
Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears , " surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die , " says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies .
thus says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , " Go , get yourself to this treasurer , even to Shebna , who is over the house , and say ,
'What are you doing here ? who has you here , that you have dug out a tomb here ? ' cutting himself out a tomb on high , chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock ! "
behold , Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently . yes , he will grasp you firmly .
he will surely wind you around and around , and throw you like a ball into a large country . there you will die , and there the chariots of your glory will be , you shame of your lord 's house .
I will thrust you from your office . you will be pulled down from your station .
it will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah ,
and I will clothe him with your robe , and strengthen him with your belt . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder . he will open , and no one will shut . he will shut , and no one will open .
I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place . he will be for a throne of glory to his father 's house .
they will hang on him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , every small vessel , from the cups even to all the pitchers .
" in that day , " says Yahweh of Armies , " the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way . it will be cut down , and fall . the burden that was on it will be cut off , for Yahweh has spoken it . "
the burden of Tyre . Howl , you ships of Tarshish ! for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in . from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them .
be still , you inhabitants of the coast , you whom the merchants of Sidon , that pass over the sea , have replenished .
on great waters , the seed of the Shihor , the harvest of the Nile , was her revenue . she was the market of nations .
be ashamed , Sidon ; for the sea has spoken , the stronghold of the sea , saying , " I have not travailed , nor brought forth , neither have I nourished young men , nor brought up virgins . "
when the report comes to Egypt , they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre .
pass over to Tarshish ! Wail , you inhabitants of the coast !
is this your joyous city , whose antiquity is of ancient days , whose feet carried her far away to travel ?
who has planned this against Tyre , the giver of crowns , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth ?
Yahweh of Armies has planned it , to stain the pride of all glory , to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth .
pass through your land like the Nile , daughter of Tarshish . there is no restraint any more .
he has stretched out his hand over the sea . he has shaken the kingdoms . Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan 's strongholds .
he said , " You shall rejoice no more , you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon . arise , pass over to Kittim . even there you will have no rest . "
Howl , you ships of Tarshish , for your stronghold is laid waste !
it will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years , according to the days of one king . after the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute .
take a harp ; go about the city , you prostitute that has been forgotten . make sweet melody . sing many songs , that you may be remembered .
it will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth .
behold , Yahweh makes the earth empty , makes it waste , turns it Upside down , and scatters its inhabitants .
the earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste ; for Yahweh has spoken this word .
the earth mourns and fades away . the world languishes and fades away . the lofty people of the earth languish .
the earth also is polluted under its inhabitants , because they have transgressed the laws , violated the statutes , and broken the everlasting Covenant .
therefore the curse has devoured the earth , and those who dwell therein are found guilty . therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
the new wine mourns . the vine languishes . all the merry @-@ hearted sigh .
the mirth of tambourines ceases . the sound of those who rejoice ends . the joy of the harp ceases .
they will not drink wine with a song . strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it .
the confused city is broken down . every house is shut up , that no man may come in .
there is a crying in the streets because of the wine . all joy is darkened . the mirth of the land is gone .
the city is left in desolation , and the gate is struck with destruction .
for it will be so in the midst of the earth among the peoples , as the shaking of an olive tree , as the gleanings when the vintage is done .
these shall lift up their voice . they will shout for the majesty of Yahweh . they cry aloud from the sea .
therefore glorify Yahweh in the east , even the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel , in the islands of the sea !
fear , the pit , and the snare , are on you who inhabitant the earth .
it will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit ; and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit will be taken in the snare ; for the windows on high are opened , and the foundations of the earth tremble .
the earth is utterly broken . the earth is torn apart . the earth is shaken violently .
the earth will stagger like a drunken man , and will sway back and forth like a hammock . its disobedience will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
it shall happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high , and the kings of the earth on the earth .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
then the moon shall be confounded , and the sun ashamed ; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion , and in Jerusalem ; and before his elders will be glory .
Yahweh , you are my God . I will exalt you ! I will praise your name , for you have done wonderful things , things planned long ago , in complete faithfulness and truth .
for you have made a city into a heap , a fortified city into a ruin , a palace of strangers to be no city . it will never be built .
therefore a strong people will glorify you . a city of awesome nations will fear you .
as the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers ; as the heat by the shade of a cloud , the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low .
in this mountain , Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of fat things , a feast of choice wines , of fat things full of marrow , of well refined choice wines .
he has swallowed up death forever ! the Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces . he will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth , for Yahweh has spoken it .
it shall be said in that day , " behold , this is our God ! we have waited for him , and he will save us ! this is Yahweh ! we have waited for him . we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation ! "
for in this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest . Moab will be trodden down in his place , even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill .
he will spread out his hands in its midst , like one who swims spreads out hands to swim , but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands .
he has brought the high fortress of your walls down , laid low , and brought to the ground , even to the dust .
in that day , this song will be sung in the land of Judah : " we have a strong city . God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks .
open the gates , that the righteous nation may enter : the one which keeps faith .
you will keep whoever 's mind is steadfast in perfect peace , because he trusts in you .
trust in Yahweh forever ; for in Yah , Yahweh , is an everlasting Rock .
for he has brought down those who dwell on high , the lofty city . he lays it low . he lays it low even to the ground . he brings it even to the dust .
the foot shall tread it down ; Even the feet of the poor , and the steps of the needy . "
the way of the just is uprightness . you who are upright make the path of the righteous level .
yes , in the way of your judgments , Yahweh , have we waited for you . your name and your renown are the desire of our soul .
with my soul have I desired you in the night . yes , with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly ; for when your judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness .
let favor be shown to the wicked , yet he will not learn righteousness . in the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully , and will not see Yahweh 's majesty .
Yahweh , your hand is lifted up , yet they don 't see ; but they will see your zeal for the people , and be disappointed . yes , fire will consume your adversaries .
Yahweh , you will ordain peace for us , for you have also worked all our works for us .
Yahweh our God , other lords besides you have had dominion over us , but by you only will we make mention of your name .
the dead shall not live . the deceased shall not rise . therefore have you visited and destroyed them , and caused all memory of them to perish .
you have increased the nation , O Yahweh . you have increased the nation ! you are glorified ! you have enlarged all the borders of the land .
Yahweh , in trouble they have visited you . they poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them .
like as a woman with child , who draws near the time of her delivery , is in pain and cries out in her pangs ; so we have been before you , Yahweh .
we have been with child . we have been in pain . we gave birth , it seems , only to wind . we have not worked any deliverance in the earth ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter into your rooms , and shut your doors behind you . hide yourself for a little moment , until the indignation is past .
for , behold , Yahweh comes forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity . the earth also will disclose her blood , and will no longer cover her slain .
in that day , Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan , the fleeing serpent , and leviathan the twisted serpent ; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea .
in that day , sing to her , " A pleasant vineyard !
I , Yahweh , am its keeper . I will water it every moment . Lest anyone damage it , I will keep it night and day .
wrath is not in me , but if I should find briers and thorns , I would do battle ! I would march on them and I would burn them together .
or else let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me . let him make peace with me . "
in days to come , Jacob will take root . Israel will blossom and bud . they will fill the surface of the world with fruit .
has he struck them as he struck those who struck them ? or are they killed like those who killed them were killed ?
in measure , when you send them away , you contend with them . he has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind .
for the fortified city is solitary , a habitation deserted and forsaken , like the wilderness . the calf will feed there , and there he will lie down , and consume its branches .
when its boughs are withered , they will be broken off . the women will come and set them on fire , for they are a people of no understanding . therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them , and he who formed them will show them no favor .
it will happen in that day , that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the Brook of Egypt ; and you will be gathered one by one , children of Israel .
Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim , and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty , which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine !
behold , the Lord has a mighty and strong one . like a storm of hail , a destroying storm , and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing , he will cast them down to the earth with his hand .
the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot .
in that day , Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory , and a diadem of beauty , to the residue of his people ;
and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment , and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate .
they also reel with wine , and stagger with strong drink . the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink . they are swallowed up by wine . they stagger with strong drink . they err in vision . they stumble in judgment .
for all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness .
whom will he teach knowledge ? to whom will he explain the message ? those who are weaned from the milk , and drawn from the breasts ?
but he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language ;
to whom he said , " This is the resting place . give rest to weary " ; and " This is the refreshing " ; yet they would not hear .
therefore hear the word of Yahweh , you scoffers , that rule this people in Jerusalem :
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , " behold , I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone , a tried stone , a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation . he who believes shall not act hastily .
I will make justice the measuring line , and righteousness the Plumb line . the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies , and the waters will overflow the hiding place .
your Covenant with death shall be annulled , and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand . when the overflowing scourge passes through , then you will be trampled down by it .
as often as it passes through , it will seize you ; for morning by morning it will pass through , by day and by night ; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message . "
for the bed is too short to stretch out on , and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in .
now therefore don 't be scoffers , lest your bonds be made strong ; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , on the whole earth .
give ear , and hear my voice ! listen , and hear my speech !
does he who plows to sow plow continually ? does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods ?
when he has leveled its surface , doesn 't he plant the dill , and scatter the cumin seed , and put in the wheat in rows , the barley in the appointed place , and the spelt in its place ?
for his God instructs him in right judgment , and teaches him .
for the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin ; but the dill is beaten out with a stick , and the cumin with a rod .
bread flour must be ground ; so he will not always be threshing it . although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it , his horses don 't grind it .
this also comes forth from Yahweh of Armies , who is wonderful in counsel , and excellent in wisdom .
Woe to Ariel ! Ariel , the city where David encamped ! add year to year ; let the feasts come around ;
then I will distress Ariel , and there will be mourning and lamentation . she shall be to me as an altar Hearth .
I will encamp against you all around you , and will lay siege against you with posted troops . I will raise siege works against you .
you will be brought down , and will speak out of the ground . your speech will mumble out of the dust . your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and your speech will whisper out of the dust .
but the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust , and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away . yes , it will be in an instant , suddenly .
she will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with Thunder , with earthquake , with great noise , with whirlwind and storm , and with the flame of a devouring fire .
pause and wonder ! blind yourselves and be blind ! they are drunken , but not with wine ; they stagger , but not with strong drink .
for Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep , and has closed your eyes , the prophets ; and he has covered your heads , the seers .
and the book is delivered to one who is not educated , saying , " Read this , please " ; and he says , " I can 't read . "
the Lord said , " Because this people draws near with their mouth and with their lips to honor me , but they have removed their heart far from me , and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught ;
therefore , behold , I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people , even a marvelous work and a wonder ; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish , and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden . "
Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh , and whose works are in the dark , and who say , " Who sees us ? " and " Who knows us ? "
Isn 't it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest ?
in that day , the deaf will hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness .
the humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh , and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
for the ruthless is brought to nothing , and the scoffer ceases , and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off--
who cause a person to be indicted by a word , and lay a snare for the arbiter in the gate , and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony .
therefore thus says Yahweh , who redeemed Abraham , concerning the house of Jacob : " Jacob shall no longer be ashamed , neither shall his face grow pale .
but when he sees his children , the work of my hands , in the midst of him , they will sanctify my name . yes , they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and will stand in awe of the God of Israel .
they also who err in spirit will come to understanding , and those who grumble will receive instruction . "
who set out to go down into Egypt , and have not asked my advice ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh , and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt !
therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame , and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion .
for their princes are at Zoan , and their ambassadors have come to Hanes .
they shall all be ashamed because of a people that can 't profit them , that are not a help nor profit , but a shame , and also a reproach . "
for Egypt helps in vain , and to no purpose ; therefore have I called her Rahab who sits still .
now go , write it before them on a tablet , and inscribe it in a book , that it may be for the time to come forever and ever .
for it is a rebellious people , lying children , children who will not hear the law of Yahweh ;
who tell the seers , " Don 't see ! " and to the prophets , " Don 't prophesy to us right things . tell us pleasant things . Prophesy deceits .
get out of the way . turn aside from the path . cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us . "
therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel , " Because you despise this word , and trust in oppression and perverseness , and rely on it ;
therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant .
he will break it as a Potter 's vessel is broken , breaking it in pieces without sparing , so that there won 't be found among the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the Hearth , or to dip up water out of the cistern . "
for thus said the Lord Yahweh , the Holy One of Israel , " You will be saved in returning and rest . your strength will be in quietness and in confidence . " you refused ,
but you said , " No , for we will flee on horses " ; therefore you will flee ; and , " We will ride on the swift " ; therefore those who pursue you will be swift .
one thousand will flee at the threat of one . at the threat of five , you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain , and like a banner on a hill .
for the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem . you will weep no more . he will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry . when he hears you , he will answer you .
though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction , yet your teachers won 't be hidden anymore , but your eyes will see your teachers ;
and when you turn to the right hand , and when you turn to the left , your ears will hear a voice behind you , saying , " This is the way . walk in it . "
you shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver , and the plating of your molten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an unclean thing . you shall tell it , " Go away ! "
he will give the rain for your seed , with which you will sow the ground ; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful . in that day , your livestock will feed in large pastures .
the oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory provender , which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork .
there shall be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
behold , the name of Yahweh comes from far away , burning with his anger , and in thick rising smoke . his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue is as a devouring fire .
his breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction ; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples .
you will have a song , as in the night when a holy feast is kept ; and gladness of heart , as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard , and will show the descent of his arm , with the indignation of his anger , and the flame of a devouring fire , with a blast , storm , and hailstones .
for through the voice of Yahweh the Assyrian will be dismayed . he will strike him with his rod .
every stroke of the rod of punishment , which Yahweh will lay on him , will be with the sound of tambourines and harps . he will fight with them in battles , brandishing weapons .
Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help , and rely on horses , and trust in chariots because they are many , and in horsemen because they are very strong , but they don 't look to the Holy One of Israel , and they don 't seek Yahweh !
yet he also is wise , and will bring disaster , and will not call back his words , but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of those who work iniquity .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when Yahweh stretches out his hand , both he who helps shall stumble , and he who is helped shall fall , and they all shall be consumed together .
as birds hovering , so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem . he will protect and deliver it . he will pass over and preserve it . "
return to him from whom you have deeply revolted , children of Israel .
for in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold--sin which your own hands have made for you .
" the Assyrian will fall by the sword , not of man ; and the sword , not of mankind , shall devour him . he will flee from the sword , and his young men will become subject to forced labor .
his rock will pass away by reason of terror , and his princes will be afraid of the banner , " says Yahweh , whose fire is in Zion , and his furnace in Jerusalem .
behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in justice .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the storm , as streams of water in a dry place , as the shade of a large rock in a weary land .
the eyes of those who see will not be dim , and the ears of those who hear will listen .
the heart of the rash will understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly .
the fool will no longer be called noble , nor the scoundrel be highly respected .
the ways of the scoundrel are evil . he devises wicked devices to destroy the humble with lying words , even when the needy speaks right .
but the noble devises noble things ; and he will continue in noble things .
rise up , you women who are at ease ! hear my voice ! you careless daughters , give ear to my speech !
for days beyond a year you will be troubled , you careless women ; for the vintage shall fail . the harvest won 't come .
Tremble , you women who are at ease ! be troubled , you careless ones ! strip yourselves , make yourselves naked , and put sackcloth on your waist .
beat your breasts for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine .
for the palace will be forsaken . the populous city will be deserted . the hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever , a delight for wild donkeys , a pasture of flocks ;
until the Spirit is poured on us from on high , and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field , and the fruitful field is considered a forest .
then justice will dwell in the wilderness ; and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field .
the work of righteousness will be peace ; and the effect of righteousness , quietness and confidence forever .
my people will live in a peaceful habitation , in safe dwellings , and in quiet resting places .
though hail flattens the forest , and the city is leveled completely .
blessed are you who sow beside all waters , who send out the feet of the ox and the donkey .
Yahweh , be gracious to us . we have waited for you . be our strength every morning , our salvation also in the time of trouble .
at the noise of the Thunder , the peoples have fled . when you lift yourself up , the nations are scattered .
your spoil will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers . men will leap on it as locusts leap .
Yahweh is exalted , for he dwells on high . he has filled Zion with justice and righteousness .
there will be stability in your times , abundance of salvation , wisdom , and knowledge . the fear of Yahweh is your treasure .
behold , their valiant ones cry outside ; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly .
the highways are desolate . the traveling man ceases . the Covenant is broken . he has despised the cities . he doesn 't respect man .
the land mourns and languishes . Lebanon is confounded and Withers away . Sharon is like a desert , and Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare .
" now I will arise , " says Yahweh ; " Now I will lift myself up . now I will be exalted .
you will conceive chaff . you will bring forth stubble . your breath is a fire that will devour you .
the peoples will be like the burning of lime , like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire .
hear , you who are far off , what I have done ; and , you who are near , acknowledge my might . "
he will dwell on high . his place of defense will be the fortress of rocks . his bread will be supplied . his waters will be sure .
your eyes will see the king in his beauty . they will see a distant land .
your heart will meditate on the terror . where is he who counted ? where is he who weighed ? where is he who counted the towers ?
you will no longer see the fierce people , a people of a deep speech that you can 't comprehend , with a strange language that you can 't understand .
but there Yahweh will be with us in majesty , a place of broad rivers and streams , in which no galley with oars will go , neither will any gallant ship pass by there .
for Yahweh is our judge . Yahweh is our lawgiver . Yahweh is our king . he will save us .
your rigging is untied . they couldn 't strengthen the foot of their mast . they couldn 't spread the sail . then the prey of a great spoil was divided . the lame took the prey .
the inhabitant won 't say , " I am sick . " the people who dwell therein will be forgiven their iniquity .
come near , you nations , to hear ! listen , you peoples . let the earth and all it contains hear ; the world , and everything that comes from it .
for Yahweh is enraged against all the nations , and angry with all their armies . he has utterly destroyed them . he has given them over for slaughter .
their slain will also be cast out , and the stench of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will melt in their blood .
all of the army of the sky will be dissolved . the sky will be rolled up like a scroll , and all its armies will fade away , as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree .
for my sword has drunk its fill in the sky . behold , it will come down on Edom , and on the people of my curse , for judgment .
the wild oxen will come down with them , and the young bulls with the mighty bulls ; and their land will be drunken with blood , and their dust made greasy with fat .
for Yahweh has a day of vengeance , a year of recompense for the cause of Zion .
its streams will be turned into pitch , its dust into sulfur , And its land will become burning pitch .
it won 't be quenched night nor day . its smoke will go up forever . from generation to generation , it will lie waste . no one will pass through it forever and ever .
but the pelican and the porcupine will possess it . the owl and the raven will dwell in it . he will stretch the line of confusion over it , and the Plumb line of emptiness .
they shall call its nobles to the kingdom , but none shall be there ; and all its princes shall be nothing .
thorns will come up in its palaces , nettles and thistles in its fortresses ; and it will be a habitation of jackals , a court for ostriches .
the wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves , and the wild goat will cry to his fellow . yes , the night creature shall settle there , and shall find herself a place of rest .
the arrow snake will make her nest there , and lay , Hatch , and gather under her shade . yes , the kites will be gathered there , every one with her Mate .
search in the book of Yahweh , and read : not one of these will be missing. none will lack her Mate . for my mouth has commanded , and his Spirit has gathered them .
he has cast the lot for them , and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line . they shall possess it forever . from generation to generation they will dwell in it .
the wilderness and the dry land will be glad . the desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose .
it will blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's glory Lebanon will be given to it , the excellence of Carmel and Sharon . they will see Yahweh 's glory , the excellence of our God .
strengthen the weak hands , and make firm the feeble knees .
tell those who have a fearful heart , " Be strong . Don 't be afraid . behold , your God will come with vengeance , God 's retribution . he will come and save you .
then the eyes of the blind will be opened , and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped .
then the lame man will leap like a deer , and the tongue of the mute will sing ; for waters will break out in the wilderness , and streams in the desert .
the burning sand will become a pool , and the thirsty ground springs of water . grass with reeds and rushes will be in the habitation of jackals , where they lay .
no lion will be there , nor will any ravenous animal go up on it . they will not be found there ; but the redeemed will walk there .
the Yahweh 's ransomed ones will return , and come with singing to Zion ; and everlasting joy will be on their heads . they will obtain gladness and joy , and sorrow and sighing will flee away . "
now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah , and captured them .
the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army . he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller 's field highway .
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder came out to him .
Rabshakeh said to them , " Now tell Hezekiah , ' Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria , " What confidence is this in which you trust ?
I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words . now in whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
behold , you trust in the staff of this bruised Reed , even in Egypt , which if a man leans on it , it will go into his hand and Pierce it . so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him .
now therefore , please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it ? Yahweh said to me , " Go up against this land , and destroy it . " ' "
then Rabshakeh stood , and called out with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
thus says the king , ' Don 't let Hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you .
Don 't let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us . this city won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . " '
beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , " Yahweh will deliver us . " have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? have they delivered Samaria from my hand ?
but they remained silent , and said nothing in reply , for the king 's commandment was , " Don 't answer him . "
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , covered himself with sackcloth , and went into Yahweh 's house .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
they said to him , " Thus says Hezekiah , ' This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and of rejection ; for the children have come to the birth , and there is no strength to bring forth .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "
so Rabshakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah , for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish .
he heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , " He has come out to fight against you . " when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
" thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , ' Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , " Jerusalem won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
behold , you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands , by destroying them utterly . shall you be delivered ?
have the gods of the nations delivered them , which my fathers have destroyed , Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , and the children of Eden who were in Telassar ?
where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? ' "
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it . then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh 's house , and spread it before Yahweh .
Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh , saying ,
" Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , who is enthroned among the cherubim , you are the God , even you alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth . you have made heaven and earth .
turn your ear , Yahweh , and hear . open your eyes , Yahweh , and behold . hear all of the words of Sennacherib , who has sent to defy the living God .
truly , Yahweh , the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries and their land ,
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , Yahweh our God , save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh , even you only . "
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dug and drunk water , and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt . "
have you not heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it in ancient times ? now I have brought it to pass , that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities , turning them into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants had little power . they were dismayed and confounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green herb , like the grass on the housetops , and like a field before its crop has grown .
but I know your sitting down , your going out , your coming in , and your raging against me .
because of your raging against me , and because your arrogance has come up into my ears , therefore will I put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came .
this shall be the sign to you . you will eat this year that which grows of itself , and in the second year that which springs from the same ; and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards , and eat their fruit .
the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
for out of Jerusalem a remnant will go forth , and survivors will escape from Mount Zion . the zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this . '
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria , ' He will not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither will he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mound against it .
by the way that he came , by the same he shall return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yahweh .
'For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
the angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and eighty @-@ five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
so Sennacherib king of Assyria departed , went away , returned to Nineveh , and stayed there .
it happened , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place .
in those days was Hezekiah sick and near death . Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , came to him , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Set your house in order , for you will die , and not live . ' "
then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh ,
and said , " Remember now , Yahweh , I beg you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " Hezekiah wept bitterly .
then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah , saying ,
" go , and tell Hezekiah , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of David your father , " I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . behold , I will add fifteen years to your life .
I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria , and I will defend this city .
this shall be the sign to you from Yahweh , that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken .
behold , I will cause the shadow on the sundial , which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun , to return backward ten steps . so the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down . " ' "
the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and had recovered of his sickness .
I said , " In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol . I am deprived of the residue of my years . "
I said , " I won 't see Yah , Yah in the land of the living . I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
my dwelling is removed , and is carried away from me like a shepherd 's tent . I have rolled up , like a weaver , my life . he will cut me off from the loom . from day even to night you will make an end of me .
I waited patiently until morning . he breaks all my bones like a lion . from day even to night you will make an end of me .
I chattered like a swallow or a crane . I moaned like a dove . my eyes weaken looking upward . Lord , I am oppressed . be my security . "
what will I say ? he has both spoken to me , and himself has done it . I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul .
Lord , men live by these things ; and my spirit finds life in all of them : you restore me , and cause me to live .
behold , for peace I had great anguish , but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption ; for you have cast all my sins behind your back .
for Sheol can 't praise you . death can 't celebrate you . those who go down into the pit can 't hope for your truth .
the living , the living , he shall praise you , as I do this day . the father shall make known your truth to the children .
Yahweh will save me . therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Yahweh .
now Isaiah had said , " Let them take a cake of figs , and lay it for a poultice on the boil , and he shall recover . "
Hezekiah also had said , " What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Yahweh ? "
at that time , Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah ; for he heard that he had been sick , and had recovered .
then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah , and asked him , " What did these men say ? where did they come from to you ? " Hezekiah said , " They have come from a country far from me , even from Babylon . "
then he asked , " What have they seen in your house ? " Hezekiah answered , " They have seen all that is in my house . there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them . "
then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , " Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies :
'Behold , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Babylon . nothing will be left , ' says Yahweh .
'They will take away your sons who will issue from you , whom you shall father , and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon 's palace . ' "
then Hezekiah said to Isaiah , " Yahweh 's word which you have spoken is good . " he said moreover , " For there will be peace and truth in my days . "
" speak comfortably to Jerusalem ; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned , that she has received of Yahweh 's hand double for all her sins . "
every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low . the uneven shall be made level , and the rough places a plain .
the glory of Yahweh shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together ; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it . "
the grass Withers , the flower fades , because Yahweh 's breath blows on it . surely the people are like grass .
the grass Withers , the flower fades ; but the word of our God stands forever . "
behold , the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one , and his arm will rule for him . behold , his reward is with him , and his recompense before him .
he will feed his flock like a shepherd . he will gather the lambs in his arm , and carry them in his bosom . he will gently lead those who have their young .
who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand , and marked off the sky with his span , and calculated the dust of the earth in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scales , and the hills in a balance ?
who has directed the Spirit of Yahweh , or has taught him as his counselor ?
who did he take counsel with , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of justice , and taught him knowledge , and showed him the way of understanding ?
behold , the nations are like a drop in a bucket , and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance . behold , he lifts up the islands like a very little thing .
Lebanon is not sufficient to burn , nor its animals sufficient for a burnt offering .
all the nations are like nothing before him . they are regarded by him as less than nothing , and vanity .
to whom then will you liken God ? or what likeness will you compare to him ?
a workman has cast an image , and the goldsmith overlays it with gold , and casts silver chains for it .
he who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot . he seeks a skillful workman to set up an engraved image for him that will not be moved .
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard , yet ? haven 't you been told from the beginning ? haven 't you understood from the foundations of the earth ?
it is he who sits above the circle of the earth , and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers ; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain , and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in ;
who brings princes to nothing ; who makes the judges of the earth like meaningless .
they are planted scarcely . they are sown scarcely . their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground . he merely blows on them , and they wither , and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble .
" to whom then will you liken me ? who is my equal ? " says the Holy One .
why do you say , Jacob , and speak , Israel , " My way is hidden from Yahweh , and the justice due me is disregarded by my God ? "
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard ? the everlasting God , Yahweh , The Creator of the ends of the earth , doesn 't faint . he isn 't weary . his understanding is unsearchable .
he gives power to the weak . he increases the strength of him who has no might .
even the youths faint and get weary , and the young men utterly fall ;
but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength . they will mount up with wings like eagles . they will run , and not be weary . they will walk , and not faint .
" keep silent before me , islands , and let the peoples renew their strength . let them come near , then let them speak . let 's meet together for judgment .
he pursues them , and passes by safely , Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet .
who has worked and done it , calling the generations from the beginning ? I , Yahweh , the first , and with the last , I am he . "
the islands have seen , and fear . the ends of the earth tremble . they approach , and come .
everyone helps his neighbor . they say to their brothers , " Be strong ! "
so the carpenter encourages the goldsmith . he who smoothes with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil , saying of the soldering , " It is good " ; and he fastens it with nails , that it might not totter .
" but you , Israel , my servant , Jacob whom I have chosen , the seed of Abraham my friend ,
you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth , and called from its corners , and said to you , ' You are my servant , I have chosen you and not cast you away ; '
Don 't you be afraid , for I am with you . Don 't be dismayed , for I am your God . I will strengthen you . yes , I will help you . yes , I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness .
behold , all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded . those who strive with you will be like nothing , and shall perish .
you will seek them , and won 't find them , even those who contend with you . those who war against you will be as nothing , as a non @-@ existent thing .
for I , Yahweh your God , will hold your right hand , saying to you , ' Don 't be afraid . I will help you . '
Don 't be afraid , you worm Jacob , and you men of Israel . I will help you , " says Yahweh , " and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel .
behold , I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth . you will thresh the mountains , and beat them small , and will make the hills like chaff .
you will winnow them , and the wind will carry them away , and the whirlwind will scatter them . you will rejoice in Yahweh . you will glory in the Holy One of Israel .
the poor and needy seek water , and there is none . their tongue fails for thirst . I , Yahweh , will answer them . I , the God of Israel , will not forsake them .
I will open rivers on the bare heights , and springs in the midst of the valleys . I will make the wilderness a pool of water , and the dry land springs of water .
I will put cedar , acacia , myrtle , and oil trees in the wilderness . I will set fir trees , pine , and box trees together in the desert ;
that they may see , know , consider , and understand together , that the hand of Yahweh has done this , and the Holy One of Israel has created it .
produce your cause , " says Yahweh . " bring forth your strong reasons , " says the King of Jacob .
" let them announce , and declare to us what shall happen . declare the former things , what they are , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or show us things to come .
declare the things that are to come hereafter , that we may know that you are gods . yes , do good , or do evil , that we may be dismayed , and see it together .
behold , you are of nothing , and your work is of nothing . he who chooses you is an abomination .
" I have raised up one from the north , and he has come ; from the rising of the sun , one who calls on my name ; and he shall come on rulers as on mortar , and as the Potter treads clay .
who has declared it from the beginning , that we may know ? and before , that we may say , ' He is right ? ' surely , there is no one who declares . surely , there is no one who shows . surely , there is no one who hears your words .
I am the first to say to Zion , ' behold , look at them ; ' and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem .
when I look , there is no man ; even among them there is no counselor who , when I ask of them , can answer a word .
behold , all of them , their works are vanity and nothing . their molten images are wind and confusion .
" behold , my servant , whom I uphold ; my chosen , in whom my soul delights-- I have put my Spirit on him . he will bring justice to the nations .
he will not shout , nor raise his voice , nor cause it to be heard in the street .
he won 't break a bruised Reed . he won 't quench a dimly burning wick . he will faithfully bring justice .
he will not fail nor be discouraged , until he has set justice in the earth , and the islands will wait for his law . "
thus says God Yahweh , he who created the heavens and stretched them out , he who spread out the earth and that which comes out of it , he who gives breath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it .
" I , Yahweh , have called you in righteousness , and will hold your hand , and will keep you , and make you a Covenant for the people , as a light for the nations ;
to open the blind eyes , to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon , and those who sit in darkness out of the prison .
" I am Yahweh . that is my name . I will not give my glory to another , nor my praise to engraved images .
behold , the former things have happened , and I declare new things . I tell you about them before they come up . "
let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices , with the villages that Kedar inhabits . let the inhabitants of Sela sing . let them shout from the top of the mountains !
Yahweh will go out like a mighty man . he will stir up zeal like a man of war . he will raise a war cry . yes , he will shout aloud . he will triumph over his enemies .
" I have been silent a long time . I have been quiet and restrained myself . now I will cry out like a travailing woman . I will both gasp and pant .
I will destroy mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs . I will make the rivers islands , and will dry up the pools .
" those who trust in engraved images , who tell molten images , ' You are our gods ' will be turned back . they will be utterly disappointed .
" hear , you deaf , and look , you blind , that you may see .
who is blind , but my servant ? or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send ? who is as blind as he who is at peace , and as blind as Yahweh 's servant ?
you see many things , but don 't observe . his ears are open , but he doesn 't listen .
it pleased Yahweh , for his righteousness ' sake , to magnify the law , and make it honorable .
who is there among you who will give ear to this ? who will listen and hear for the time to come ?
who gave Jacob as plunder , and Israel to the robbers ? Didn 't Yahweh , he against whom we have sinned ? for they would not walk in his ways , and they disobeyed his law .
therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him , and the strength of battle ; and it set him on fire all around , but he didn 't know ; and it burned him , but he didn 't take it to heart . "
but now thus says Yahweh who created you , Jacob , and he who formed you , Israel : " Don 't be afraid , for I have redeemed you . I have called you by your name . you are mine .
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not overflow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and flame will not scorch you .
for I am Yahweh your God , the Holy One of Israel , your Savior . I have given Egypt as your ransom , Ethiopia and Seba in your place .
since you have been precious and honored in my sight , and I have loved you ; therefore I will give people in your place , and nations instead of your life .
Don 't be afraid ; for I am with you . I will bring your seed from the east , and gather you from the west .
I will tell the north , ' Give them up ! ' and tell the south , ' Don 't hold them back ! bring my sons from far , and my daughters from the ends of the earth--
everyone who is called by my name , and whom I have created for my glory , whom I have formed , yes , whom I have made . ' "
bring out the blind people who have eyes , and the deaf who have ears .
I myself am Yahweh ; and besides me there is no Savior .
I have declared , I have saved , and I have shown ; and there was no strange god among you . therefore you are my witnesses , " says Yahweh , " and I am God .
yes , since the day was I am he ; and there is no one who can deliver out of my hand . I will work , and who can hinder it ? "
thus says Yahweh , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : " for your sake , I have sent to Babylon , and I will bring all of them down as fugitives , even the Chaldeans , in the ships of their rejoicing .
I am Yahweh , your Holy One , the Creator of Israel , your King . "
" Don 't remember the former things , and don 't consider the things of old .
behold , I will do a new thing . it springs forth now . Don 't you know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
the animals of the field shall honor me , the jackals and the ostriches ; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen ,
the people which I formed for myself , that they might set forth my praise .
yet you have not called on me , Jacob ; but you have been weary of me , Israel .
you have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings ; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices . I have not burdened you with offerings , nor wearied you with frankincense .
you have bought me no sweet cane with money , nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices ; but you have burdened me with your sins . you have wearied me with your iniquities .
I , even I , am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake ; and I will not remember your sins .
put me in remembrance . let us plead together . set forth your case , that you may be justified .
your first father sinned , and your teachers have transgressed against me .
therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary ; and I will make Jacob a curse , and Israel an insult . "
yet listen now , Jacob my servant , and Israel , whom I have chosen .
this is what Yahweh who made you , and formed you from the womb , who will help you says : " Don 't be afraid , Jacob my servant ; and you , Jeshurun , whom I have chosen .
for I will pour water on him who is thirsty , and streams on the dry ground . I will pour my Spirit on your seed , and my blessing on your offspring :
and they will spring up among the grass , as willows by the watercourses .
one will say , ' I am Yahweh 's ; ' and another will be called by the name of Jacob ; and another will write with his hand ' to Yahweh , ' and honor the name of Israel . "
this is what Yahweh , the King of Israel , and his Redeemer , Yahweh of Armies , says : " I am the first , and I am the last ; and besides me there is no God .
who has fashioned a god , or molds an image that is profitable for nothing ?
behold , all his fellows will be disappointed ; and the workmen are mere men . let them all be gathered together . let them stand up . they will fear . they will be put to shame together .
the blacksmith takes an axe , works in the coals , fashions it with hammers , and works it with his strong arm . he is hungry , and his strength fails ; he drinks no water , and is faint .
the carpenter stretches out a line . he marks it out with a pencil . he shapes it with planes . he marks it out with compasses , and shapes it like the figure of a man , with the beauty of a man , to reside in a house .
he cuts down cedars for himself , and takes the Cypress and the oak , and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest . he plants a fir tree , and the rain nourishes it .
the rest of it he makes into a god , even his engraved image . he bows down to it and worships , and prays to it , and says , " Deliver me ; for you are my god ! "
they don 't know , neither do they consider : for he has shut their eyes , that they can 't see ; and their hearts , that they can 't understand .
he feeds on ashes . a deceived heart has turned him aside ; and he can 't deliver his soul , nor say , " Isn 't there a lie in my right hand ? "
remember these things , Jacob and Israel ; for you are my servant . I have formed you . you are my servant . Israel , you will not be forgotten by me .
I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , your transgressions , and , as a cloud , your sins . return to me , for I have redeemed you .
" I will go before you , and make the rough places smooth . I will break the doors of brass in pieces , and cut apart the bars of iron .
I will give you the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Yahweh , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
for Jacob my servant 's sake , and Israel my chosen , I have called you by your name . I have surnamed you , though you have not known me .
I am Yahweh , and there is none else . besides me , there is no God . I will strengthen you , though you have not known me ;
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none besides me . I am Yahweh , and there is no one else .
I form the light , and create darkness . I make peace , and create calamity . I am Yahweh , who does all these things .
Woe to him who says to a father , ' What have you become the father of ? ' or to a mother , ' To what have you given birth ? ' "
thus says Yahweh , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker : " you ask me about the things that are to come , concerning my sons , and you command me concerning the work of my hands !
I have made the earth , and created man on it . I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens ; and I have commanded all their army .
most certainly you are a God who hidden yourself , God of Israel , the Savior . ' "
they will be disappointed , yes , confounded , all of them . those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together .
Israel will be saved by Yahweh with an everlasting salvation . you will not be disappointed nor confounded to ages everlasting .
" assemble yourselves and come . draw near together , you who have escaped from the nations . those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved image , and pray to a god that can 't save .
" look to me , and be saved , all the ends of the earth ; for I am God , and there is no other .
I have sworn by myself , the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and will not return , that to me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall take an oath .
they will say of me , ' There is righteousness and strength only in Yahweh . ' " even to him shall men come ; and all those who were incensed against him shall be disappointed .
they stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves have gone into captivity .
" listen to me , house of Jacob , and all the remnant of the house of Israel , that have been borne from their birth , that have been carried from the womb ;
and even to old age I am he , and even to gray hairs will I carry you . I have made , and I will bear ; yes , I will carry , and will deliver .
" to whom will you liken me , and make me equal , and compare me , that we may be like ?
some pour out gold from the bag , and weigh silver in the balance . they hire a goldsmith , and he makes it a god . they fall down--yes , they worship .
they bear it on the shoulder , they carry it , and set it in its place , and it stands , from its place it shall not move : yes , one may cry to it , yet it can not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
" remember this , and show yourselves men ; bring it again to mind , you transgressors .
remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me ;
declaring the end from the beginning , and from ancient times things that are not yet done ; saying , My counsel shall stand , and I will do all my pleasure ;
calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man of my counsel from a far country ; yes , I have spoken , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed , I will also do it .
listen to me , you stout @-@ hearted , who are far from righteousness :
I bring near my righteousness , it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not wait ; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory .
" come down , and sit in the dust , virgin daughter of Babylon ; sit on the ground without a throne , daughter of the Chaldeans : for you shall no more be called tender and delicate .
take the millstones , and grind meal ; remove your veil , strip off the train , uncover the leg , pass through the rivers .
your nakedness shall be uncovered , yes , your shame shall be seen : I will take vengeance , and will spare no man . "
our Redeemer , Yahweh of Armies is his name , the Holy One of Israel .
" sit in silence , and go into darkness , daughter of the Chaldeans ; for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms .
I was angry with my people , I profaned my inheritance , and gave them into your hand : you showed them no mercy ; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke .
you said , ' I shall be a mistress forever ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
for you have trusted in your wickedness ; you have said , No one sees me ; your wisdom and your knowledge , it has perverted you , and you have said in your heart , I am , and there is none else besides me .
" stand now with your enchantments , and with the multitude of your sorceries , in which you have labored from your youth ; if so be you shall be able to profit , if so be you may prevail .
thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored : those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter ; there shall be none to save you .
" hear this , house of Jacob , you who are called by the name of Israel , and have come forth out of the waters of Judah ; who swear by the name of Yahweh , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth , nor in righteousness
( for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves on the God of Israel ; Yahweh of Armies is his name ) :
I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my mouth , and I showed them : suddenly I did them , and they happened .
because I knew that you are obstinate , and your neck is an iron sinew , and your brow brass ;
therefore I have declared it to you from of old ; before it came to pass I showed it to you ; lest you should say , ' My idol has done them , and my engraved image , and my molten image , has commanded them . '
you have heard it ; see all this ; and you , will you not declare it ? " I have shown you new things from this time , even hidden things , which you have not known .
they are created now , and not from of old ; and before this day you didn 't hear them ; lest you should say , ' behold , I knew them . '
yes , you didn 't hear ; yes , you didn 't know ; yes , from of old your ear was not opened : for I knew that you dealt very treacherously , and was called a transgressor from the womb .
for my name 's sake will I defer my anger , and for my praise will I refrain for you , that I not cut you off .
behold , I have refined you , but not as silver ; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction .
for my own sake , for my own sake , will I do it ; for how should my name be profaned ? I will not give my glory to another .
" listen to me , O Jacob , and Israel my called : I am he ; I am the first , I also am the last .
yes , my hand has laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand has spread out the heavens : when I call to them , they stand up together .
" assemble yourselves , all you , and hear ; who among them has declared these things ? he whom Yahweh loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans .
I , even I , have spoken ; yes , I have called him ; I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
" come near to me and hear this : " from the beginning I have not spoken in secret ; from the time that it was , there am I. " Now the Lord Yahweh has sent me , with his Spirit .
thus says Yahweh , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : I am Yahweh your God , who teaches you to profit , who leads you by the way that you should go .
Oh that you had listened to my commandments ! then your peace would have been like a river , and your righteousness like the waves of the sea :
your seed also had been as the sand , and the offspring of your body like its grains : his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me .
they didn 't thirst when he led them through the deserts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
listen , islands , to me ; and listen , you peoples , from far : Yahweh has called me from the womb ; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name :
and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand , he has hidden me : and he has made me a polished Shaft ; in his quiver has he kept me close :
and he said to me , " You are my servant ; Israel , in whom I will be glorified . "
but I said , " I have labored in vain , I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity ; yet surely the justice due to me is with Yahweh , and my reward with my God . "
saying to those who are bound , ' Come out ! ' ; to those who are in darkness , ' Show yourselves ! ' " they shall feed in the ways , and on all bare heights shall be their pasture .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them : for he who has mercy on them will lead them , even by springs of water he will guide them .
I will make all my mountains a way , and my highways shall be exalted .
behold , these shall come from far ; and behold , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sinim . "
sing , heavens ; and be joyful , earth ; and break forth into singing , mountains : for Yahweh has comforted his people , and will have compassion on his afflicted .
behold , I have engraved you on the palms of my hands ; your walls are continually before me .
your children make haste ; your destroyers and those who made you waste shall go forth from you .
" for , as for your waste and your desolate places , and your land that has been destroyed , surely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants , and those who swallowed you up shall be far away .
the children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears , The place is too small for me ; give place to me that I may dwell .
thus says the Lord Yahweh , " behold , I will lift up my hand to the nations , and set up my banner to the peoples ; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom , and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders .
shall the prey be taken from the mighty , or the lawful captives be delivered ?
but thus says Yahweh , " Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered ; for I will contend with him who contends with you , and I will save your children .
thus says Yahweh , " Where is the bill of your mother 's divorce , with which I have put her away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? behold , for your iniquities were you sold , and for your transgressions was your mother put away .
I clothe the heavens with blackness , and I make sackcloth their covering . "
the Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught , that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary : he wakens morning by morning , he wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught .
the Lord Yahweh has opened my ear , and I was not rebellious , neither turned away backward .
I gave my back to the strikers , and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair ; I didn 't hide my face from shame and spitting .
for the Lord Yahweh will help me ; therefore I have not been confounded : therefore have I set my face like a Flint , and I know that I shall not be disappointed .
he is near who justifies me ; who will bring charges against me ? let us stand up together : who is my adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord Yahweh will help me ; who is he who shall condemn me ? behold , all they shall wax old as a garment , the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you who fears Yahweh , who obeys the voice of his servant ? he who walks in darkness , and has no light , let him trust in the name of Yahweh , and rely on his God .
" listen to me , you who follow after righteousness , you who seek Yahweh : look to the rock you were cut from , and to the hold of the pit you were dug from .
look to Abraham your father , and to Sarah who bore you ; for when he was but one I called him , and I blessed him , and made him many .
for Yahweh has comforted Zion ; he has comforted all her waste places , and has made her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of Yahweh ; joy and gladness shall be found therein , Thanksgiving , and the voice of melody .
" attend to me , my people ; and give ear to me , my nation : for a law shall go forth from me , and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples .
my righteousness is near , my salvation is gone forth , and my arms shall judge the peoples ; the islands shall wait for me , and on my arm shall they trust .
" listen to me , you who know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; don 't fear the reproach of men , neither be dismayed at their insults .
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool ; but my righteousness shall be forever , and my salvation to all generations . "
Isn 't it you who dried up the sea , the waters of the great deep ; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over ?
the ransomed of Yahweh shall return , and come with singing to Zion ; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads . they shall obtain gladness and joy . sorrow and sighing shall flee away .
" I , even I , am he who comforts you : who are you , that you are afraid of man who shall die , and of the son of man who shall be made as grass ;
the captive exile shall speedily be freed ; and he shall not die and go down into the pit , neither shall his bread fail .
for I am Yahweh your God , who stirs up the sea , so that its waves roar : Yahweh of Armies is his name .
awake , awake , stand up , Jerusalem , that have drunk at the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath ; you have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering , and drained it .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
these two things have happened to you . who will bemoan you ? Desolation and destruction , and the famine and the sword ; how shall I comfort you ?
your sons have fainted , they lie at the head of all the streets , as an antelope in a net ; they are full of the wrath of Yahweh , the rebuke of your God .
therefore hear now this , you afflicted , and drunken , but not with wine :
thus says your Lord Yahweh , and your God who pleads the cause of his people , " behold , I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering , even the bowl of the cup of my wrath ; you shall no more drink it again :
and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you , who have said to your soul , ' bow down , that we may walk over you ; ' and you have laid your back as the ground , and as the street , to those who walk over . "
awake , awake , put on your strength , Zion ; put on your beautiful garments , Jerusalem , the holy city : for henceforth there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean .
shake yourself from the dust ! arise , sit up , Jerusalem ! release yourself from the bonds of your neck , captive daughter of Zion !
for thus says Yahweh , " You were sold for nothing ; and you shall be redeemed without money . "
for thus says the Lord Yahweh , " My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there : and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause .
therefore my people shall know my name . therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks ; behold , it is I. "
the voice of your watchmen ! they lift up the voice , together do they sing ; for they shall see eye to eye , when Yahweh returns to Zion .
break forth into joy , sing together , you waste places of Jerusalem ; for Yahweh has comforted his people , he has redeemed Jerusalem .
Yahweh has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
depart , depart , go out from there , touch no unclean thing ! go out of the midst of her ! cleanse yourselves , you who bear the vessels of Yahweh .
for you shall not go out in haste , neither shall you go by flight : for Yahweh will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard .
behold , my servant shall deal wisely , he shall be exalted and lifted up , and shall be very high .
like as many were astonished at you ( his appearance was marred more than any man , and his form more than the sons of men ) ,
so shall he sprinkle many nations ; kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they understand .
who has believed our message ? to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed ?
for he grew up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of dry ground . he has no good looks or majesty . when we see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
he was despised , and rejected by men ; a man of suffering , and acquainted with disease . he was despised as one from whom men hide their face ; and we didn 't respect him .
surely he has borne our sickness , and carried our suffering ; yet we considered him plagued , struck by God , and afflicted .
all we like sheep have gone astray . everyone has turned to his own way ; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all .
he was oppressed , yet when he was afflicted he didn 't open his mouth . as a lamb that is led to the slaughter , and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute , so he didn 't open his mouth .
they made his grave with the wicked , and with a rich man in his death ; although he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
after the suffering of his soul , he will see the light and be satisfied . my righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself ; and he will bear their iniquities .
" enlarge the place of your tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations ; don 't spare : lengthen your cords , and strengthen your stakes .
for you shall spread out on the right hand and on the left ; and your seed shall possess the nations , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
" Don 't be afraid ; for you shall not be ashamed : neither be confounded ; for you shall not be disappointed : for you shall forget the shame of your youth ; and the reproach of your widowhood you shall remember no more .
for your Maker is your husband ; Yahweh of Armies is his name : and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer ; the God of the whole earth shall he be called .
for Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit , even a wife of youth , when she is cast off , " says your God .
" for a small moment have I forsaken you ; but with great mercies will I gather you .
in overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment ; but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you , " says Yahweh your Redeemer .
" for this is like the waters of Noah to me ; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth , so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you , nor rebuke you .
for the mountains may depart , and the hills be removed ; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you , neither shall my Covenant of peace be removed , " says Yahweh who has mercy on you .
" you afflicted , tossed with storms , and not comforted , behold , I will set your stones in beautiful colors , and lay your foundations with sapphires .
I will make your pinnacles of rubies , and your gates of Sparkling jewels , and all your walls of precious stones .
all your children shall be taught of Yahweh ; and great shall be the peace of your children .
in righteousness you shall be established : you shall be far from oppression , for you shall not be afraid ; and from terror , for it shall not come near you .
behold , they may gather together , but not by me : whoever shall gather together against you shall fall because of you .
" behold , I have created the Smith who blows the fire of coals , and brings forth a weapon for his work ; and I have created the waster to destroy .
" come , everyone who thirsts , to the waters ! come , he who has no money , buy , and eat ! yes , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
why do you spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labor for that which doesn 't satisfy ? listen diligently to me , and eat you that which is good , and let your soul delight itself in fatness .
turn your ear , and come to me ; hear , and your soul shall live : and I will make an everlasting Covenant with you , even the sure mercies of David .
behold , I have given him for a witness to the peoples , a leader and commander to the peoples .
behold , you shall call a nation that you don 't know ; and a nation that didn 't know you shall run to you , because of Yahweh your God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he has glorified you . "
seek Yahweh while he may be found ; call you on him while he is near :
let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts ; and let him return to Yahweh , and he will have mercy on him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
" for my thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways my ways , " says Yahweh .
" for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
for as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky , and doesn 't return there , but waters the earth , and makes it bring forth and bud , and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater ;
so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth : it shall not return to me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing I sent it to do .
for you shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing ; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands .
instead of the Thorn shall come up the fir tree ; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree : and it shall be to Yahweh for a name , for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off . "
thus says Yahweh , " keep justice , and do righteousness ; for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
blessed is the man who does this , and the son of man who holds it fast ; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it , and keeps his hand from doing any evil . "
neither let the foreigner , who has joined himself to Yahweh , speak , saying , " Yahweh will surely separate me from his people " ; neither let the eunuch say , " behold , I am a dry tree . "
for thus says Yahweh , " To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths , and choose the things that please me , and hold fast my Covenant :
to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh , to minister to him , and to love the name of Yahweh , to be his servants , everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it , and holds fast my Covenant ;
even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar ; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples . "
the Lord Yahweh , who gathers the outcasts of Israel , says , " Yet will I gather others to him , besides his own who are gathered . "
all you animals of the field , come to devour , all you animals in the forest .
his watchmen are blind , they are all without knowledge ; they are all mute dogs , they can 't bark ; dreaming , lying down , loving to slumber .
yes , the dogs are greedy , they can never have enough ; and these are shepherds who can 't understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
" come , " say they , " I will get wine , and we will fill ourselves with strong drink ; and tomorrow shall be as this day , great beyond measure . "
the righteous perishes , and no man lays it to heart ; and merciful men are taken away , none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil .
he enters into peace ; they rest in their beds , each one who walks in his uprightness .
" but draw near here , you sons of the sorceress , the seed of the adulterer and the prostitute .
on a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed ; there also you went up to offer sacrifice .
you went to the king with oil , and increased your perfumes , and sent your ambassadors far off , and debased yourself even to Sheol .
you were wearied with the length of your way ; yet you didn 't say , ' It is in vain . ' you found a reviving of your strength ; therefore you weren 't faint .
I will declare your righteousness ; and as for your works , they shall not profit you .
he will say , " cast up , cast up , prepare the way , take up the stumbling @-@ block out of the way of my people . "
for thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity , whose name is Holy : " I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite .
for I will not contend forever , neither will I be always angry ; for the spirit would faint before me , and the souls who I have made .
for the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry , and struck him ; I hid myself and was angry ; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart .
I have seen his ways , and will heal him : I will lead him also , and restore comforts to him and to his mourners .
I create the fruit of the lips : peace , peace , to him who is far off and to him who is near , " says Yahweh ; " and I will heal them . "
but the wicked are like the troubled sea ; for it can 't rest , and its waters cast up mire and dirt .
" there is no peace , " says my God , " for the wicked . "
" cry aloud , don 't spare , lift up your voice like a trumpet , and declare to my people their disobedience , and to the house of Jacob their sins .
'Why have we fasted , ' say they , ' and you don 't see ? why have we afflicted our soul , and you take no knowledge ? ' " behold , in the day of your fast you find pleasure , and exact all your labors .
behold , you fast for strife and contention , and to strike with the fist of wickedness : you don 't fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high .
" Isn 't this the fast that I have chosen : to release the bonds of wickedness , to undo the bands of the yoke , and to let the oppressed go free , and that you break every yoke ?
Isn 't it to distribute your bread to the hungry , and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house ? when you see the naked , that you cover him ; and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh ?
then your light shall break forth as the morning , and your healing shall spring forth speedily ; and your righteousness shall go before you ; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear guard .
then you shall call , and Yahweh will answer ; you shall cry , and he will say , ' Here I am . ' " if you take away from the midst of you the yoke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking wickedly ;
and if you draw out your soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul : then your light shall rise in darkness , and your obscurity be as the noonday ;
and Yahweh will guide you continually , and satisfy your soul in dry places , and make strong your bones ; and you shall be like a watered garden , and like a spring of water , whose waters don 't fail .
behold , Yahweh 's hand is not shortened , that it can 't save ; neither his ear heavy , that it can 't hear :
but your iniquities have separated between you and your God , and your sins have hidden his face from you , so that he will not hear .
for your hands are defiled with blood , and your fingers with iniquity ; your lips have spoken lies , your tongue mutters wickedness .
none sues in righteousness , and none pleads in truth : they trust in vanity , and speak lies ; they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity .
they Hatch adders ' eggs , and weave the spider 's web : he who eats of their eggs dies ; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
their feet run to evil , and they make haste to shed innocent blood : their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity ; desolation and destruction are in their paths .
the way of peace they don 't know ; and there is no justice in their goings : they have made them crooked paths ; whoever goes therein does not know peace .
therefore is justice far from us , neither does righteousness overtake us : we look for light , but , behold , darkness ; for brightness , but we walk in obscurity .
we grope for the wall like the blind ; yes , we grope as those who have no eyes : we stumble at noonday as in the twilight ; among those who are lusty we are as dead men .
we roar all like bears , and moan bitterly like doves : we look for justice , but there is none ; for salvation , but it is far off from us .
for our transgressions are multiplied before you , and our sins testify against us ; for our transgressions are with us , and as for our iniquities , we know them :
transgressing and denying Yahweh , and turning away from following our God , speaking oppression and revolt , conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood .
justice is turned away backward , and righteousness stands afar off ; for truth is fallen in the street , and uprightness can 't enter .
yes , truth is lacking ; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey . Yahweh saw it , and it displeased him that there was no justice .
he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessor : therefore his own arm brought salvation to him ; and his righteousness , it upheld him .
he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and a helmet of salvation on his head ; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeal as a mantle .
according to their deeds , accordingly he will repay , wrath to his adversaries , recompense to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompense .
" a Redeemer will come to Zion , and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob , " says Yahweh .
" as for me , this is my Covenant with them , " says Yahweh . " my Spirit who is on you , and my words which I have put in your mouth , shall not depart out of your mouth , nor out of the mouth of your seed , nor out of the mouth of your seed 's seed , " says Yahweh , " from henceforth and forever . "
" arise , shine ; for your light has come , and the glory of Yahweh is risen on you .
for , behold , darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the peoples ; but Yahweh will arise on you , and his glory shall be seen on you .
nations shall come to your light , and kings to the brightness of your rising .
" lift up your eyes all around , and see : they all gather themselves together , they come to you ; your sons shall come from far , and your daughters shall be carried in the arms .
then you shall see and be radiant , and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you , the wealth of the nations shall come to you .
the multitude of camels shall cover you , the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah ; all they from Sheba shall come ; they shall bring gold and frankincense , and shall proclaim the praises of Yahweh .
" who are these who fly as a cloud , and as the doves to their windows ?
" foreigners shall build up your walls , and their kings shall minister to you : for in my wrath I struck you , but in my favor have I had mercy on you .
for that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish ; yes , those nations shall be utterly wasted .
" the glory of Lebanon shall come to you , the fir tree , the pine , and the box tree together , to beautify the place of my sanctuary ; and I will make the place of my feet glorious .
the sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending to you ; and all those who despised you shall bow themselves down at the soles of your feet ; and they shall call you The city of Yahweh , The Zion of the Holy One of Israel .
" whereas you have been forsaken and hated , so that no man passed through you , I will make you an eternal excellency , a joy of many generations .
you shall also drink the milk of the nations , and shall nurse from royal breasts ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , am your Savior , and your Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
for brass I will bring gold , and for iron I will bring silver , and for wood brass , and for stones iron . I will also make your officers peace , and righteousness your ruler .
violence shall no more be heard in your land , desolation nor destruction within your borders ; but you shall call your walls salvation , and your gates Praise .
the sun shall be no more your light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you : but Yahweh will be to you an everlasting light , and your God your glory .
your sun shall no more go down , neither shall your moon withdraw itself ; for Yahweh will be your everlasting light , and the days of your mourning shall be ended .
your people also shall be all righteous ; they shall inherit the land forever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glorified .
the little one shall become a thousand , and the small one a strong nation ; I , Yahweh , will hasten it in its time . "
they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks , and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers .
but you shall be named the priests of Yahweh ; men will call you the ministers of our God : you will eat the wealth of the nations , and you will boast in their glory .
instead of your shame you shall have double ; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess double ; everlasting joy shall be to them .
their seed shall be known among the nations , and their offspring among the peoples ; all who see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed . "
for as the earth brings forth its bud , and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth ; so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until her righteousness go forth as brightness , and her salvation as a lamp that burns .
the nations shall see your righteousness , and all kings your glory , and you shall be called by a new name , which the mouth of Yahweh shall name .
you shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh , and a royal diadem in the hand of your God .
for as a young man marries a virgin , so your sons shall marry you ; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride , so your God will rejoice over you .
Yahweh has sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , " surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies ; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine , for which you have labored :
but those who have garnered it shall eat it , and praise Yahweh ; and those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary . "
go through , go through the gates ! prepare the way of the people ! cast up , cast up the highway ! gather out the stones ! lift up a banner for the peoples .
behold , Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth , " Say to the daughter of Zion , ' behold , your salvation comes . behold , his reward is with him , and his recompense before him . ' "
they shall call them The holy people , The redeemed of Yahweh : and you shall be called sought out , A city not forsaken .
why are you red in your clothing , and your garments like him who treads in the wine VAT ?
" I have trodden the winepress alone ; and of the peoples there was no man with me : yes , I trod them in my anger , and trampled them in my wrath ; and their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments , and I have stained all my clothing .
for the day of vengeance was in my heart , and the year of my redeemed has come .
I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore my own arm brought salvation to me ; and my wrath , it upheld me .
I trod down the peoples in my anger , and made them drunk in my wrath , and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth . "
I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh and the praises of Yahweh , according to all that Yahweh has bestowed on us , and the great Goodness toward the house of Israel , which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies , and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses .
for he said , " surely , they are my people , children who will not deal falsely : " so he was their Savior .
in all their affliction he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he redeemed them ; and he bore them , and carried them all the days of old .
but they rebelled , and grieved his holy Spirit : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he himself fought against them .
as the livestock that go down into the valley , the Spirit of Yahweh caused them to rest ; so you led your people , to make yourself a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory : where are your zeal and your mighty acts ? the yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me .
for you are our Father , though Abraham doesn 't know us , and Israel does not acknowledge us : you , Yahweh , are our Father ; our Redeemer from everlasting is your name .
O Yahweh , why do you make us to err from your ways , and harden our heart from your fear ? return for your servants ' sake , the tribes of your inheritance .
your holy people possessed it but a little while : our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary .
we have become as they over whom you never bear rule , as those who were not called by your name .
when you did awesome things which we didn 't look for , you came down , the mountains quaked at your presence .
you meet him who rejoices and works righteousness , those who remember you in your ways . behold , you were angry , and we sinned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be saved ?
for we have all become as one who is unclean , and all our righteousness is as a polluted garment : and we all fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , like the wind , take us away .
there is none who calls on your name , who stirs up himself to take hold of you ; for you have hidden your face from us , and have consumed us by means of our iniquities .
but now , Yahweh , you are our Father ; we are the clay , and you our Potter ; and we all are the work of your hand .
Don 't be furious , Yahweh , neither remember iniquity forever : see , look , we beg you , we are all your people .
your holy cities are become a wilderness , Zion has become a wilderness , Jerusalem a desolation .
our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised you , is burned with fire ; and all our pleasant places are laid waste .
will you refrain yourself for these things , Yahweh ? will you hold your peace , and afflict us very severely ?
" I am inquired of by those who didn 't ask ; I am found by those who didn 't seek me : I said , See me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people , who walk in a way that is not good , after their own thoughts ;
a people who provoke me to my face continually , sacrificing in gardens , and burning incense on bricks ;
who sit among the graves , and lodge in the secret places ; who eat pig 's flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
who say , Stand by yourself , don 't come near to me , for I am holier than you . these are a smoke in my nose , a fire that burns all the day .
I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains ; and my chosen shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in , for my people who have sought me .
" but you who forsake Yahweh , who forget my holy mountain , who prepare a table for Fortune , and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , " behold , my servants shall eat , but you shall be hungry ; behold , my servants shall drink , but you shall be thirsty ; behold , my servants shall rejoice , but you shall be disappointed ;
behold , my servants shall sing for joy of heart , but you shall cry for sorrow of heart , and shall wail for anguish of spirit .
you shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen ; and the Lord Yahweh will kill you ; and he will call his servants by another name :
" for , behold , I create new heavens and a new earth ; and the former things shall not be remembered , nor come into mind .
but be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create ; for , behold , I create Jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people ; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying .
they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and eat their fruit .
they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people , and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
they shall not labor in vain , nor bring forth for calamity ; for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh , and their offspring with them .
it shall happen that , before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
the wolf and the lamb shall feed together , and the lion shall eat straw like the ox ; and dust shall be the serpent 's food . they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain , " says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh , " Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool : what kind of house will you build to me ? and what place shall be my rest ?
for all these things has my hand made , and so all these things came to be , " says Yahweh : " but to this man will I look , even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit , and who trembles at my word .
I also will choose their delusions , and will bring their fears on them ; because when I called , no one answered ; when I spoke , they didn 't listen ; but they did that which was evil in my eyes , and chose that in which I didn 't delight . "
a voice of tumult from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of Yahweh that renders recompense to his enemies .
" before she travailed , she brought forth ; before her pain came , she delivered a son .
shall I bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? " says Yahweh : " shall I who cause to bring forth shut the womb ? " says your God .
" rejoice with Jerusalem , and be glad for her , all you who love her : rejoice for joy with her , all you who mourn over her ;
that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts ; that you may drink deeply , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory . "
for thus says Yahweh , " behold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream : and you will nurse . you will be carried on her side , and will be dandled on her knees .
as one whom his mother comforts , so will I comfort you ; and you will be comforted in Jerusalem . "
you will see it , and your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass : and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants ; and he will have indignation against his enemies .
for , behold , Yahweh will come with fire , and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind ; to render his anger with fierceness , and his rebuke with flames of fire .
for by fire will Yahweh execute judgment , and by his sword , on all flesh ; and the slain of Yahweh shall be many .
" for I know their works and their thoughts : the time comes , that I will gather all nations and languages ; and they shall come , and shall see my glory .
of them also will I take for priests and for Levites , " says Yahweh .
" for as the new heavens and the new earth , which I will make , shall remain before me , " says Yahweh , " so your seed and your name shall remain .
it shall happen , that from one new moon to another , and from one Sabbath to another , shall all flesh come to worship before me , " says Yahweh .
" they shall go forth , and look on the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be quenched ; and they will be loathsome to all mankind . "
the words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
now the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
" before I formed you in the belly , I knew you . before you came forth out of the womb , I sanctified you . I have appointed you a prophet to the nations . "
then I said , " Ah , Lord Yahweh ! behold , I don 't know how to speak ; for I am a child . "
but Yahweh said to me , " Don 't say , ' I am a child ; ' for to whoever I shall send you , you shall go , and whatever I shall command you , you shall speak .
Don 't be afraid because of them ; for I am with you to deliver you , " says Yahweh .
then Yahweh put forth his hand , and touched my mouth ; and Yahweh said to me , " behold , I have put my words in your mouth .
behold , I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms , to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow , to build and to plant . "
moreover the word of Yahweh came to me , saying , " Jeremiah , what do you see ? " I said , " I see a branch of an almond tree . "
then Yahweh said to me , " You have seen well ; for I watch over my word to perform it . "
the word of Yahweh came to me the second time , saying , " What do you see ? " I said , " I see a boiling caldron ; and it is tipping away from the north . "
then Yahweh said to me , " Out of the north evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land .
for , behold , I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north , " says Yahweh ; " and they shall come , and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all its walls all around , and against all the cities of Judah .
I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , in that they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , and worshiped the works of their own hands .
" you therefore put your belt on your waist , arise , and speak to them all that I command you . Don 't be dismayed at them , lest I dismay you before them .
they will fight against you ; but they will not prevail against you ; for I am with you , " says Yahweh , " to deliver you . "
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
" go , and cry in the ears of Jerusalem , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh , " I remember for you the kindness of your youth , the love of your weddings ; how you went after me in the wilderness , in a land that was not sown .
Israel was holiness to Yahweh , the first fruits of his increase . all who devour him shall be held guilty . evil shall come on them , " ' says Yahweh . "
hear the word of Yahweh , O house of Jacob , and all the families of the house of Israel !
thus says Yahweh , " What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me , that they have gone far from me , and have walked after vanity , and are become vain ?
I brought you into a plentiful land , to eat its fruit and its Goodness ; but when you entered , you defiled my land , and made my heritage an abomination .
the priests didn 't say , ' Where is Yahweh ? ' and those who handle the law didn 't know me . the rulers also transgressed against me , and the prophets prophesied by Baal , and walked after things that do not profit .
" therefore I will yet contend with you , " says Yahweh , " and I will contend with your children 's children .
has a nation changed its gods , which really are no gods ? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit .
" be astonished , you heavens , at this , and be horribly afraid . be very desolate , " says Yahweh .
" for my people have committed two evils : they have forsaken me , the spring of living waters , and cut them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water .
the children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head .
" haven 't you procured this to yourself , in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God , when he led you by the way ?
now what have you to do in the way to Egypt , to drink the waters of the Shihor ? or what have you to do in the way to Assyria , to drink the waters of the River ?
" for of old time I have broken your yoke , and burst your bonds ; and you said , ' I will not serve ; ' for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself , playing the prostitute .
yet I had planted you a noble vine , wholly a right seed . how then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me ?
for though you wash yourself with lye , and use much soap , yet your iniquity is marked before me , " says the Lord Yahweh .
" withhold your foot from being unshod , and your throat from thirst . but you said , ' It is in vain . no , for I have loved strangers , and I will go after them . '
as the thief is ashamed when he is found , so is the house of Israel ashamed ; they , their kings , their princes , and their priests , and their prophets ;
" but where are your gods that you have made for yourselves ? let them arise , if they can save you in the time of your trouble : for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Judah .
" why will you contend with me ? you all have transgressed against me , " says Yahweh .
" I have struck your children in vain . they received no correction . your own sword has devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
" can a virgin forget her ornaments , or a bride her attire ? yet my people have forgotten me for days without number .
how well you prepare your way to seek love ! therefore you have taught even the wicked women your ways .
also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
" yet you said , ' I am innocent . surely his anger has turned away from me . ' " behold , I will judge you , because you say , ' I have not sinned . '
why do you go about so much to change your way ? you will be ashamed of Egypt also , as you were ashamed of Assyria .
from there also you shall go forth , with your hands on your head ; for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust , and you shall not prosper with them .
therefore the showers have been withheld , and there has been no latter rain ; yet you have a prostitute 's forehead , you refused to be ashamed .
will you not from this time cry to me , ' My Father , you are the guide of my youth ? '
" ' will he retain his anger forever ? will he keep it to the end ? ' behold , you have spoken and have done evil things , and have had your way . "
moreover , Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king , " Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done ? she has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree , and there has played the prostitute .
I said after she had done all these things , ' She will return to me ; ' but she didn 't return ; and her treacherous sister Judah saw it .
I saw , when , for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery , I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce , yet treacherous Judah , her sister , didn 't fear ; but she also went and played the prostitute .
it happened through the lightness of her prostitution , that the land was polluted , and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
yet for all this her treacherous sister , Judah , has not returned to me with her whole heart , but only in pretense , " says Yahweh .
Yahweh said to me , " backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah .
only acknowledge your iniquity , that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God , and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree , and you have not obeyed my voice , ' says Yahweh . "
" return , backsliding children , " says Yahweh ; " for I am a husband to you . I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Zion .
I will give you shepherds according to my heart , who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding .
at that time they shall call Jerusalem ' The throne of Yahweh ; ' and all the nations shall be gathered to it , to the name of Yahweh , to Jerusalem . neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart .
in those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers .
" surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband , so you have dealt treacherously with me , house of Israel , " says Yahweh .
a voice is heard on the bare heights , the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel ; because they have perverted their way , they have forgotten Yahweh their God .
return , you backsliding children , I will heal your backsliding . " behold , we have come to you ; for you are Yahweh our God .
truly in vain is help from the hills , the tumult on the mountains . truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God .
but the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth , their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
" if you will return , Israel , " says Yahweh , " if you will return to me , and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight ; then you shall not be removed ;
and you shall swear , ' As Yahweh lives , ' in truth , in justice , and in righteousness . the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory . "
for thus says Yahweh to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem , " Break up your fallow ground , and don 't sow among thorns .
declare in Judah , and publish in Jerusalem ; and say , ' blow the trumpet in the land ! ' cry aloud and say , ' assemble yourselves ! let us go into the fortified cities ! '
set up a standard toward Zion . flee for safety ! Don 't wait ; for I will bring evil from the north , and a great destruction . "
a lion is gone up from his thicket , and a destroyer of nations ; he is on his way , he is gone forth from his place , to make your land desolate , that your cities be laid waste , without inhabitant .
for this clothe yourself with sackcloth , lament and wail ; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn 't turned back from us .
" it shall happen at that day , " says Yahweh , " that the heart of the king shall perish , and the heart of the princes ; and the priests shall be astonished , and the prophets shall wonder . "
then I said , " Ah , Lord Yahweh ! surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem , saying , ' You shall have peace ; ' whereas the sword reaches to the heart . "
a full wind from these shall come for me . now I will also utter judgments against them . "
behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind : his horses are swifter than eagles . Woe to us ! for we are ruined .
Jerusalem , wash your heart from wickedness , that you may be saved . how long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you ?
for a voice declares from Dan , and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim :
" tell the nations ; behold , publish against Jerusalem , ' watchers come from a far country , and raise their voice against the cities of Judah .
as keepers of a field , they are against her all around , because she has been rebellious against me , ' " says Yahweh .
" your way and your doings have brought these things to you . this is your wickedness ; for it is bitter , for it reaches to your heart . "
my anguish , my anguish ! I am pained at my very heart ; my heart is disquieted in me ; I can 't hold my peace ; because you have heard , O my soul , the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war .
destruction on destruction is cried ; for the whole land is laid waste : suddenly are my tents destroyed , and my curtains in a moment .
how long shall I see the standard , and hear the sound of the trumpet ?
" for my people are foolish , they don 't know me . they are foolish children , and they have no understanding . they are skillful in doing evil , but to do good they have no knowledge . "
I saw the earth , and , behold , it was waste and void ; and the heavens , and they had no light .
I saw the mountains , and behold , they trembled , and all the hills moved back and forth .
I saw , and behold , there was no man , and all the birds of the sky had fled .
I saw , and behold , the fruitful field was a wilderness , and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh , before his fierce anger .
for thus says Yahweh , " The whole land shall be a desolation ; yet will I not make a full end .
for this the earth will mourn , and the heavens above be black ; because I have spoken it , I have purposed it , and I have not repented , neither will I turn back from it . "
every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers ; they go into the thickets , and climb up on the rocks : every city is forsaken , and not a man dwells therein .
though they say , ' As Yahweh lives ; ' surely they swear falsely . "
then I said , " surely these are poor . they are foolish ; for they don 't know the way of Yahweh , nor the law of their God .
I will go to the great men , and will speak to them ; for they know the way of Yahweh , and the law of their God . " but these with one accord have broken the yoke , and burst the bonds .
" how can I pardon you ? your children have forsaken me , and sworn by what are no gods . when I had fed them to the full , they committed adultery , and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes ' houses .
they were as fed horses roaming at large : everyone neighed after his neighbor 's wife .
Shouldn 't I punish them for these things ? " says Yahweh ; " and shouldn 't my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
" go up on her walls , and destroy ; but don 't make a full end . take away her branches ; for they are not Yahweh 's .
for the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me , " says Yahweh .
they have denied Yahweh , and said , " It is not he ; neither shall evil come on us ; neither shall we see sword nor famine .
the prophets shall become wind , and the word is not in them . thus shall it be done to them . "
therefore thus says Yahweh , the God of Armies , " Because you speak this word , behold , I will make my words in your mouth fire , and this people wood , and it shall devour them .
behold , I will bring a nation on you from far , house of Israel , " says Yahweh . " it is a mighty nation . it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language you don 't know , neither understand what they say .
their quiver is an open tomb , they are all mighty men .
they shall eat up your harvest , and your bread , which your sons and your daughters should eat . they shall eat up your flocks and your herds . they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees . they shall beat down your fortified cities , in which you trust , with the sword .
" but even in those days , " says Yahweh , " I will not make a full end with you .
" declare this in the house of Jacob , and publish it in Judah , saying ,
'Hear now this , foolish people , and without understanding ; who have eyes , and don 't see ; who have ears , and don 't hear :
" but this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart ; they have revolted and gone .
neither do they say in their heart , ' Let us now fear Yahweh our God , who gives rain , both the former and the latter , in its season ; who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest . '
" your iniquities have turned away these things , and your sins have withheld good from you .
for among my people are found wicked men . they watch , as fowlers lie in wait . they set a trap . they catch men .
as a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit . therefore they have become great , and grew rich .
they have grown fat . they shine ; yes , they excell in deeds of wickedness . they don 't plead the cause , the cause of the fatherless , that they may prosper ; and they don 't judge the right of the needy .
" shall I not punish for these things ? " says Yahweh . " shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
" an astonishing and horrible thing has happened in the land .
the prophets prophesy falsely , and the priests rule by their own authority ; and my people love to have it so . what will you do in the end of it ?
the comely and delicate one , the daughter of Zion , will I cut off .
shepherds with their flocks shall come to her ; they shall pitch their tents against her all around ; they shall feed everyone in his place . "
" prepare war against her ; arise , and let us go up at noon . Woe to us ! for the day declines , for the shadows of the evening are stretched out .
arise , and let us go up by night , and let us destroy her palaces . "
for Yahweh of Armies said , " Cut down trees , and cast up a mound against Jerusalem : this is the city to be visited ; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her .
as a well casts forth its waters , so she casts forth her wickedness : violence and destruction is heard in her ; before me continually is sickness and wounds .
be instructed , Jerusalem , lest my soul be alienated from you ; lest I make you a desolation , a land not inhabited . "
thus says Yahweh of Armies , " They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine . turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets . "
to whom shall I speak and testify , that they may hear ? behold , their ear is uncircumcised , and they can 't listen . behold , the word of Yahweh has become a reproach to them . they have no delight in it .
their houses shall be turned to others , their fields and their wives together ; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land , says Yahweh . "
" for from their least even to their greatest , everyone is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even to the priest , everyone deals falsely .
they have healed also the hurt of my people superficially , saying , ' Peace , peace ! ' when there is no peace .
I set watchmen over you , saying , ' listen to the sound of the trumpet ! ' but they said , ' We will not listen ! '
therefore hear , you nations , and know , Congregation , what is among them .
hear , earth ! behold , I will bring evil on this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not listened to my words ; and as for my law , they have rejected it .
to what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices pleasing to me . "
therefore thus says Yahweh , " behold , I will lay stumbling blocks before this people . the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them . the neighbor and his friend shall perish . "
thus says Yahweh , " behold , a people comes from the north country . a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
they take hold of bow and spear . they are cruel , and have no mercy . their voice roars like the sea , and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Zion . "
we have heard its report ; our hands become feeble : anguish has taken hold of us , and pains as of a woman in labor .
Don 't go forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and terror , are on every side .
daughter of my people , clothe yourself with sackcloth , and wallow in ashes ! mourn , as for an only son , most bitter lamentation ; for the destroyer shall suddenly come on us .
" I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among my people ; that you may know and try their way .
they are all grievous rebels , going about with slanders ; they are brass and iron : they all of them deal corruptly .
the bellows blow fiercely ; the lead is consumed of the fire : in vain do they go on refining ; for the wicked are not plucked away .
men will call them rejected silver , because Yahweh has rejected them . "
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
" stand in the gate of Yahweh 's house , and proclaim there this word , and say , ' Hear the word of Yahweh , all you of Judah , who enter in at these gates to worship Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , Amend your ways and your doings , and I will cause you to dwell in this place .
Don 't trust in lying words , saying , Yahweh 's temple , Yahweh 's temple , Yahweh 's temple , are these .
for if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings ; if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor ;
if you don 't oppress the foreigner , the fatherless , and the widow , and don 't shed innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other gods to your own hurt :
then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , from of old even forevermore .
behold , you trust in lying words , that can 't profit .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of robbers in your eyes ? behold , I , even I , have seen it , says Yahweh .
but go now to my place which was in Shiloh , where I caused my name to dwell at the first , and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel .
now , because you have done all these works , says Yahweh , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you didn 't hear ; and I called you , but you didn 't answer :
therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name , in which you trust , and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers , as I did to Shiloh .
I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your brothers , even the whole seed of Ephraim .
therefore don 't pray for this people , neither lift up a cry nor prayer for them , neither make intercession to me ; for I will not hear you .
Don 't you see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
the children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead the dough , to make cakes to the queen of the sky , and to pour out drink offerings to other gods , that they may provoke me to anger .
do they provoke me to anger ? says Yahweh . Don 't they provoke themselves , to the confusion of their own faces ?
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices , and eat meat .
for I didn 't speak to your fathers , nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
but this thing I commanded them , saying , listen to my voice , and I will be your God , and you shall be my people ; and walk in all the way that I command you , that it may be well with you .
but they didn 't listen nor turn their ear , but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart , and went backward , and not forward .
since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day , I have sent to you all my servants the prophets , daily rising up early and sending them :
yet they didn 't listen to me , nor inclined their ear , but made their neck stiff : they did worse than their fathers .
you shall speak all these words to them ; but they will not listen to you : you shall also call to them ; but they will not answer you .
cut off your hair , and throw it away , and take up a lamentation on the bare heights ; for Yahweh has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath .
for the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight , says Yahweh : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it .
they have built the high places of Topheth , which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I didn 't command , nor did it come into my mind .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that it shall no more be called Topheth , nor The valley of the son of Hinnom , but The valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in Topheth , until there is no place to bury .
the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the earth ; and none shall frighten them away .
then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah , and from the streets of Jerusalem , the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride ; for the land shall become a waste .
at that time , says Yahweh , they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah , and the bones of his princes , and the bones of the priests , and the bones of the prophets , and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem , out of their graves ;
death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family , that remain in all the places where I have driven them , says Yahweh of Armies .
moreover you shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh : shall men fall , and not rise up again ? shall one turn away , and not return ?
why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding ? they hold fast deceit , they refuse to return .
I listened and heard , but they didn 't speak aright : no man repents him of his wickedness , saying , What have I done ? everyone turns to his course , as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle .
yes , the stork in the sky knows her appointed times ; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming ; but my people don 't know Yahweh 's law .
how do you say , We are wise , and the law of Yahweh is with us ? but , behold , the false pen of the scribes has worked falsely .
the wise men are disappointed , they are dismayed and taken : behold , they have rejected the word of Yahweh ; and what kind of wisdom is in them ?
therefore will I give their wives to others , and their fields to those who shall possess them : for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness ; from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely .
they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore shall they fall among those who fall ; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down , says Yahweh .
we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of healing , and behold , dismay !
for , behold , I will send Serpents , adders , among you , which will not be charmed ; and they shall bite you , says Yahweh .
Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow ! my heart is faint within me .
the harvest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saved .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt : I mourn ; dismay has taken hold on me .
is there no balm in Gilead ? is there no physician there ? why then isn 't the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
Oh that my head were waters , and my eyes a spring of tears , that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they are all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
they bend their tongue , as their bow , for falsehood ; and they are grown strong in the land , but not for truth : for they proceed from evil to evil , and they don 't know me , says Yahweh .
take heed everyone of his neighbor , and don 't trust in any brother ; for every brother will utterly supplant , and every neighbor will go about with slanders .
they will deceive everyone his neighbor , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies ; they weary themselves to commit iniquity .
your habitation is in the midst of deceit ; through deceit they refuse to know me , says Yahweh .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , behold , I will melt them , and try them ; for how should I deal with the daughter of my people ?
their tongue is a deadly arrow ; it speaks deceit : one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth , but in his heart he lays wait for him .
shall I not visit them for these things ? says Yahweh ; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
I will make Jerusalem heaps , a dwelling place of jackals ; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation , without inhabitant .
who is the wise man , that may understand this ? who is he to whom the mouth of Yahweh has spoken , that he may declare it ? why is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness , so that none passes through ?
Yahweh says , Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them , and have not obeyed my voice , neither walked therein ,
but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart , and after the Baals , which their fathers taught them ;
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
I will scatter them also among the nations , whom neither they nor their fathers have known ; and I will send the sword after them , until I have consumed them .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , consider , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for the skillful women , that they may come :
and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
for a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion , How are we ruined ! we are greatly confounded , because we have forsaken the land , because they have cast down our dwellings .
yet hear the word of Yahweh , you women , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth ; and teach your daughters wailing , and everyone her neighbor lamentation .
for death has come up into our windows , it is entered into our palaces ; to cut off the children from outside , and the young men from the streets .
speak , Thus says Yahweh , The dead bodies of men shall fall as Dung on the open field , and as the handful after the harvester ; and none shall gather them .
thus says Yahweh , Don 't let the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , don 't let the rich man glory in his riches ;
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will punish all those who are circumcised in uncircumcision :
hear the word which Yahweh speaks to you , house of Israel !
thus says Yahweh , " Don 't learn the way of the nations , and don 't be dismayed at the signs of the sky ; for the nations are dismayed at them .
for the customs of the peoples are vanity ; for one cuts a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman with the axe .
they deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it not move .
they are like a palm tree , of turned work , and don 't speak : they must be carried , because they can 't go . Don 't be afraid of them ; for they can 't do evil , neither is it in them to do good . "
there is none like you , Yahweh ; you are great , and your name is great in might .
who should not fear you , King of the nations ? for it appertains to you ; because among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their royal estate , there is none like you .
but they are together brutish and foolish : the instruction of idols ! it is but a stock .
there is silver beaten into plates , which is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith ; blue and purple for their clothing ; they are all the work of skillful men .
but Yahweh is the true God ; he is the living God , and an everlasting King : at his wrath the earth trembles , and the nations are not able to withstand his indignation .
you shall say this to them : the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth , these shall perish from the earth , and from under the heavens .
he has made the earth by his power , he has established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens :
when he utters his voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens , and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he makes lightnings for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries .
every man has become brutish and without knowledge ; every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
they are vanity , a work of delusion : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
the portion of Jacob is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance : Yahweh of Armies is his name .
gather up your wares out of the land , you who live under siege .
for thus says Yahweh , behold , I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time , and will distress them , that they may feel it .
Woe is me because of my hurt ! my wound is grievous : but I said , Truly this is my grief , and I must bear it .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
for the shepherds are become brutish , and have not inquired of Yahweh : therefore they have not prospered , and all their flocks are scattered .
the voice of news , behold , it comes , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the cities of Judah a desolation , a dwelling place of jackals .
Yahweh , I know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man who walks to direct his steps .
Yahweh , correct me , but in measure : not in your anger , lest you bring me to nothing .
pour out your wrath on the nations that don 't know you , and on the families that don 't call on your name : for they have devoured Jacob , yes , they have devoured him and consumed him , and have laid waste his habitation .
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
hear the words of this Covenant , and speak to the men of Judah , and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem ;
and say to them , Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : Cursed is the man who doesn 't hear the words of this Covenant ,
Yahweh said to me , proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , Hear the words of this Covenant , and do them .
for I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , even to this day , rising early and protesting , saying , obey my voice .
Yahweh said to me , A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah , and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers , who refused to hear my words ; and they are gone after other gods to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my Covenant which I made with their fathers .
therefore thus says Yahweh , behold , I will bring evil on them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and they shall cry to me , but I will not listen to them .
then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense : but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing , even altars to burn incense to Baal .
therefore don 't pray for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them ; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble .
Yahweh called your name , A green olive tree , beautiful with goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it , and its branches are broken .
for Yahweh of Armies , who planted you , has pronounced evil against you , because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah , which they have worked for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal .
Yahweh gave me knowledge of it , and I knew it : then you showed me their doings .
but , Yahweh of Armies , who judges righteously , who tests the heart and the mind , I shall see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth , who seek your life , saying , You shall not prophesy in the name of Yahweh , that you not die by our hand ;
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , behold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine ;
and there shall be no remnant to them : for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
you have planted them , yes , they have taken root ; they grow , yes , they bring forth fruit : you are near in their mouth , and far from their heart .
but you , Yahweh , know me ; you see me , and try my heart toward you : pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare them for the day of slaughter .
for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt treacherously with you ; even they have cried aloud after you : Don 't believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
I have forsaken my house , I have cast off my heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
my heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest : she has uttered her voice against me ; therefore I have hated her .
is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey ? are the birds of prey against her all around ? go , assemble all the animals of the field , bring them to devour .
many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard , they have trodden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
they have made it a desolation ; it mourns to me , being desolate ; the whole land is made desolate , because no man lays it to heart .
Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness ; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh has peace .
they have sown wheat , and have reaped thorns ; they have put themselves to pain , and profit nothing : and you shall be ashamed of your fruits , because of the fierce anger of Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors , who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit : behold , I will pluck them up from off their land , and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them .
it shall happen , after that I have plucked them up , I will return and have compassion on them ; and I will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
but if they will not hear , then will I pluck up that nation , plucking up and destroying it , says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh to me , Go , and buy yourself a linen belt , and put it on your waist , and don 't put it in water .
so I bought a belt according to the word of Yahweh , and put it on my waist .
take the belt that you have bought , which is on your waist , and arise , go to the Euphrates , and hide it there in a cleft of the rock .
so I went , and hid it by the Euphrates , as Yahweh commanded me .
it happened after many days , that Yahweh said to me , arise , go to the Euphrates , and take the belt from there , which I commanded you to hide there .
then I went to the Euphrates , and dug , and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it ; and behold , the belt was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
then the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
thus says Yahweh , In this way I will mar the pride of Judah , and the great pride of Jerusalem .
this evil people , who refuse to hear my words , who walk in the stubbornness of their heart , and are gone after other gods to serve them , and to worship them , shall even be as this belt , which is profitable for nothing .
I will dash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , says Yahweh : I will not pity , nor spare , nor have compassion , that I should not destroy them .
hear , and give ear ; don 't be proud ; for Yahweh has spoken .
give glory to Yahweh your God , before he causes darkness , and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains , and , while you look for light , he turns it into the shadow of death , and makes it gross darkness .
but if you will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret for your pride ; and my eye shall weep bitterly , and run down with tears , because Yahweh 's flock is taken captive .
say to the king and to the queen mother , humble yourselves , sit down ; for your headdresses have come down , even the crown of your glory .
the cities of the South are shut up , and there is none to open them : Judah is carried away captive , all of it ; it is wholly carried away captive .
lift up your eyes , and see those who come from the north : where is the flock that was given you , your beautiful flock ?
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you ? shall not sorrows take hold of you , as of a woman in travail ?
if you say in your heart , Why are these things come on me ? for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered , and your heels suffer violence .
can the Ethiopian change his skin , or the Leopard his spots ? then may you also do good , who are accustomed to do evil .
therefore will I scatter them , as the stubble that passes away , by the wind of the wilderness .
this is your lot , the portion measured to you from me , says Yahweh ; because you have forgotten me , and trusted in falsehood .
therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face , and your shame shall appear .
the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought .
Judah mourns , and its gates languish , they sit in black on the ground ; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up .
their nobles send their little ones to the waters : they come to the cisterns , and find no water ; they return with their vessels empty ; they are disappointed and confounded , and cover their heads .
because of the ground which is cracked , because no rain has been in the land , the plowmen are disappointed , they cover their heads .
yes , the hind also in the field calves , and forsakes her young , because there is no grass .
the wild donkeys stand on the bare heights , they pant for air like jackals ; their eyes fail , because there is no herbage .
though our iniquities testify against us , work for your name 's sake , Yahweh ; for our backslidings are many ; we have sinned against you .
you hope of Israel , its Savior in the time of trouble , why should you be as a foreigner in the land , and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night ?
why should you be like a scared man , as a mighty man who can 't save ? yet you , Yahweh , are in the midst of us , and we are called by your name ; don 't leave us .
Yahweh said to me , Don 't pray for this people for their good .
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering , I will not accept them ; but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence .
then I said , Ah , Lord Yahweh ! behold , the prophets tell them , You shall not see the sword , neither shall you have famine ; but I will give you assured peace in this place .
the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword ; and they shall have none to bury them--them , their wives , nor their sons , nor their daughters : for I will pour their wickedness on them .
you shall say this word to them , Let my eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease ; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grievous wound .
have you utterly rejected Judah ? has your soul loathed Zion ? why have you struck us , and there is no healing for us ? we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of healing , and behold , dismay !
we acknowledge , Yahweh , our wickedness , and the iniquity of our fathers ; for we have sinned against you .
do not abhor us , for your name 's sake ; do not disgrace the throne of your glory : remember , don 't break your Covenant with us .
then Yahweh said to me , Though Moses and Samuel stood before me , yet my mind would not be toward this people : cast them out of my sight , and let them go forth .
I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh , the son of Hezekiah , king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
for who will have pity on you , Jerusalem ? or who will bemoan you ? or who will turn aside to ask of your welfare ?
you have rejected me , says Yahweh , you have gone backward : therefore have I stretched out my hand against you , and destroyed you ; I am weary with repenting .
I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have bereaved them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they didn 't return from their ways .
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday : I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly .
Yahweh said , Most certainly I will strengthen you for good ; most certainly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
can one break iron , even iron from the north , and brass ?
your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil without price , and that for all your sins , even in all your borders .
Yahweh , you know ; remember me , and visit me , and avenge me of my persecutors ; don 't take me away in your longsuffering : know that for your sake I have suffered reproach .
your words were found , and I ate them ; and your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart : for I am called by your name , Yahweh , God of Armies .
I didn 't sit in the assembly of those who make merry , nor rejoiced ; I sat alone because of your hand ; for you have filled me with indignation .
why is my pain perpetual , and my wound incurable , which refuses to be healed ? will you indeed be to me as a deceitful Brook , as waters that fail ?
I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall ; and they shall fight against you , but they shall not prevail against you ; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you , says Yahweh .
I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked , and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible .
the word of Yahweh came also to me , saying ,
you shall not take a wife , neither shall you have sons or daughters , in this place .
for thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who bore them , and concerning their fathers who became their father in this land :
both great and small shall die in this land ; they shall not be buried , neither shall men lament for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for them ;
neither shall men break bread for them in mourning , to comfort them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother .
you shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them , to eat and to drink .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will cause to cease out of this place , before your eyes and in your days , the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride .
it shall happen , when you shall show this people all these words , and they shall tell you , Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us ? or what is our iniquity ? or what is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God ?
then you shall tell them , Because your fathers have forsaken me , says Yahweh , and have walked after other gods , and have served them , and have worshiped them , and have forsaken me , and have not kept my law ;
and you have done evil more than your fathers ; for , behold , you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart , so that you don 't listen to me :
therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known , neither you nor your fathers ; and there you shall serve other gods day and night ; for I will show you no favor .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that it shall no more be said , As Yahweh lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
for my eyes are on all their ways ; they are not hidden from my face , neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes .
first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double , because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things , and have filled my inheritance with their abominations .
shall a man make to himself gods , which yet are no gods ?
therefore behold , I will cause them to know , this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is Yahweh .
the sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it is engraved on the tablet of their heart , and on the horns of your altars ;
while their children remember their altars and their Asherim by the green trees on the high hills .
my mountain in the field , I will give your substance and all your treasures for a spoil , and your high places , because of sin , throughout all your borders .
you , even of yourself , shall discontinue from your heritage that I gave you ; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you don 't know : for you have kindled a fire in my anger which shall burn forever .
thus says Yahweh : Cursed is the man who trusts in man , and makes flesh his arm , and whose heart departs from Yahweh .
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , a salt land and not inhabited .
blessed is the man who trusts in Yahweh , and whose trust Yahweh is .
the heart is deceitful above all things , and it is exceedingly corrupt : who can know it ?
I , Yahweh , search the mind , I try the heart , even to give every man according to his ways , according to the fruit of his doings .
as the partridge that sits on eggs which she has not laid , so is he who gets riches , and not by right ; in the midst of his days they shall leave him , and at his end he shall be a fool .
a glorious throne , set on high from the beginning , is the place of our sanctuary .
Yahweh , the hope of Israel , all who forsake you shall be disappointed . those who depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken Yahweh , the spring of living waters .
heal me , O Yahweh , and I shall be healed ; save me , and I shall be saved : for you are my praise .
behold , they tell me , Where is the word of Yahweh ? let it come now .
Don 't be a terror to me : you are my refuge in the day of evil .
let them be disappointed who persecute me , but let not me be disappointed ; let them be dismayed , but don 't let me be dismayed ; bring on them the day of evil , and destroy them with double destruction .
thus said Yahweh to me : go , and stand in the gate of the children of the people , through which the kings of Judah come in , and by which they go out , and in all the gates of Jerusalem ;
and tell them , Hear the word of Yahweh , you kings of Judah , and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
thus says Yahweh , Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the Sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day holy , neither do any work : but make the Sabbath day , as I commanded your fathers .
but they didn 't listen , neither turn their ear , but made their neck stiff , that they might not hear , and might not receive instruction .
it shall happen , if you diligently listen to me , says Yahweh , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day , but to make the Sabbath day holy , to do no work therein ;
they shall come from the cities of Judah , and from the places around Jerusalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the lowland , and from the hill country , and from the South , bringing burnt offerings , and sacrifices , and meal offerings , and frankincense , and bringing sacrifices of Thanksgiving , to the house of Yahweh .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
arise , and go down to the Potter 's house , and there I will cause you to hear my words .
then I went down to the Potter 's house , and behold , he was making a work on the wheels .
when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the Potter , he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the Potter to make it .
at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it ;
if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them .
at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant it ;
if they do that which is evil in my sight , that they not obey my voice , then I will repent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
but they say , It is in vain ; for we will walk after our own devices , and we will do everyone after the stubbornness of his evil heart .
therefore thus says Yahweh : ask now among the nations , who has heard such things ; the virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing .
shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field ? shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up ?
for my people have forgotten me , they have burned incense to false gods ; and they have been made to stumble in their ways , in the ancient paths , to walk in byways , in a way not built up ;
to make their land an astonishment , and a perpetual hissing ; everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished , and shake his head .
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will show them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
give heed to me , Yahweh , and listen to the voice of those who contend with me .
therefore deliver up their children to the famine , and give them over to the power of the sword ; and let their wives become childless , and widows ; and let their men be slain of death , and their young men struck of the sword in battle .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when you shall bring a troop suddenly on them ; for they have dug a pit to take me , and hid snares for my feet .
thus said Yahweh , Go , and buy a Potter 's earthen bottle , and take some of the elders of the people , and of the elders of the priests ;
and go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is by the entry of the gate Harsith , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you ;
and have built the high places of Baal , to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal ; which I didn 't command , nor spoke it , neither came it into my mind :
therefore , behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that this place shall no more be called Topheth , nor The valley of the son of Hinnom , but The valley of slaughter .
I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies , and by the hand of those who seek their life : and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the earth .
I will make this city an astonishment , and a hissing ; everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues .
I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters ; and they shall eat everyone the flesh of his friend , in the siege and in the distress , with which their enemies , and those who seek their life , shall distress them .
then you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who go with you ,
thus will I do to this place , says Yahweh , and to its inhabitants , even making this city as Topheth :
and the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses of the kings of Judah , which are defiled , shall be as the place of Topheth , even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky , and have poured out drink offerings to other gods .
then came Jeremiah from Topheth , where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of Yahweh 's house , and said to all the people :
now Pashhur , the son of Immer the priest , who was chief officer in the house of Yahweh , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things .
then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yahweh .
it happened on the next day , that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks . then Jeremiah said to him , Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur , but Magormissabib .
moreover I will give all the riches of this city , and all its gains , and all the precious things of it , yes , all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall make them a prey , and take them , and carry them to Babylon .
Yahweh , you have persuaded me , and I was persuaded ; you are stronger than I , and have prevailed : I am become a laughing @-@ stock all the day , every one mocks me .
for as often as I speak , I cry out ; I cry , Violence and destruction ! because the word of Yahweh is made a reproach to me , and a derision , all the day .
but , Yahweh of Armies , who tests the righteous , who sees the heart and the mind , let me see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
sing to Yahweh , praise Yahweh ; for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers .
Cursed is the day in which I was born : Don 't let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed .
Cursed is the man who brought news to my father , saying , A boy is born to you ; making him very glad .
let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew , and didn 't repent : and let him hear a cry in the morning , and shouting at noontime ;
because he didn 't kill me from the womb ; and so my mother would have been my grave , and her womb always great .
why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow , that my days should be consumed with shame ?
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah , the priest , saying ,
please inquire of Yahweh for us ; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon makes war against us : perhaps Yahweh will deal with us according to all his wondrous works , that he may go up from us .
then Jeremiah said to them , You shall tell Zedekiah :
I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation .
I will strike the inhabitants of this city , both man and animal : they shall die of a great pestilence .
to this people you shall say , Thus says Yahweh : behold , I set before you the way of life and the way of death .
he who remains in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he who goes out , and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you , he shall live , and his life shall be to him for a prey .
for I have set my face on this city for evil , and not for good , says Yahweh : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
touching the house of the king of Judah , hear the word of Yahweh :
behold , I am against you , O inhabitant of the valley , and of the rock of the plain , says Yahweh ; you that say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?
I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , says Yahweh ; and I will kindle a fire in her forest , and it shall devour all that is around her .
thus said Yahweh : go down to the house of the king of Judah , and speak there this word ,
say , Hear the word of Yahweh , king of Judah , who sits on the throne of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
but if you will not hear these words , I swear by myself , says Yahweh , that this house shall become a desolation .
I will prepare destroyers against you , everyone with his weapons ; and they shall cut down your choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbor , Why has Yahweh done thus to this great city ?
then they shall answer , Because they forsook the Covenant of Yahweh their God , and worshiped other gods , and served them .
Don 't weep for the dead , neither bemoan him ; but weep bitterly for him who goes away ; for he shall return no more , nor see his native country .
for thus says Yahweh touching Shallum the son of Josiah , king of Judah , who reigned instead of Josiah his father , and who went forth out of this place : he shall not return there any more .
but in the place where they have led him captive , there shall he die , and he shall see this land no more .
Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness , and his rooms by injustice ; who uses his neighbor 's service without wages , and doesn 't give him his hire ;
he judged the cause of the poor and needy ; then it was well . Wasn 't this to know me ? says Yahweh .
but your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness , and for shedding innocent blood , and for oppression , and for violence , to do it .
he shall be buried with the burial of a donkey , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
go up to Lebanon , and cry ; and lift up your voice in Bashan , and cry from Abarim ; for all your lovers are destroyed .
I spoke to you in your prosperity ; but you said , I will not hear . this has been your way from your youth , that you didn 't obey my voice .
the wind shall feed all your shepherds , and your lovers shall go into captivity : surely then you will be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness .
as I live , says Yahweh , though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand , yet would I pluck you there ;
and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life , and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid , even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of the Chaldeans .
I will cast you out , and your mother who bore you , into another country , where you were not born ; and there you will die .
but to the land whereunto their soul longs to return , there shall they not return .
is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel ? is he a vessel in which none delights ? why are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into the land which they don 't know ?
O earth , earth , earth , hear the word of Yahweh .
Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture ! says Yahweh .
I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and multiply .
I will set up shepherds over them , who shall feed them ; and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall any be lacking , says Yahweh .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will raise to David a righteous Branch , and he shall reign as king and deal wisely , and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land .
in his days Judah shall be saved , and Israel shall dwell safely ; and this is his name by which he shall be called : Yahweh our righteousness .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that they shall no more say , As Yahweh lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
concerning the prophets . my heart within me is broken , all my bones shake ; I am like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Yahweh , and because of his holy words .
for the land is full of adulterers ; for because of swearing the land mourns ; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up . their course is evil , and their might is not right ;
for both prophet and priest are profane ; yes , in my house have I found their wickedness , says Yahweh .
therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein ; for I will bring evil on them , even the year of their visitation , says Yahweh .
I have seen Folly in the prophets of Samaria ; they prophesied by Baal , and caused my people Israel to err .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the prophets : behold , I will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink the water of gall ; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land .
they say continually to those who despise me , Yahweh has said , You shall have peace ; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say , No evil shall come on you .
for who has stood in the council of Yahweh , that he should perceive and hear his word ? who has marked my word , and heard it ?
behold , the storm of Yahweh , his wrath , has gone forth . yes , a whirling storm . it shall burst on the head of the wicked .
the anger of Yahweh shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the intents of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly .
I sent not these prophets , yet they ran : I didn 't speak to them , yet they prophesied .
but if they had stood in my council , then had they caused my people to hear my words , and had turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their doings .
am I a God at hand , says Yahweh , and not a God afar off ?
can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him ? says Yahweh . Don 't I fill heaven and earth ? says Yahweh .
I have heard what the prophets have said , who prophesy lies in my name , saying , I have dreamed , I have dreamed .
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies , even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart ?
who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor , as their fathers forgot my name for Baal .
the prophet who has a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he who has my word , let him speak my word faithfully . what is the straw to the wheat ? says Yahweh .
Isn 't my word like fire ? says Yahweh ; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces ?
therefore behold , I am against the prophets , says Yahweh , who steal my words everyone from his neighbor .
behold , I am against the prophets , says Yahweh , who use their tongues , and say , He says .
when this people , or the prophet , or a priest , shall ask you , saying , What is the burden of Yahweh ? then you shall tell them , What burden ! I will cast you off , says Yahweh .
as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , who shall say , The burden of Yahweh , I will even punish that man and his house .
you shall say everyone to his neighbor , and everyone to his brother , What has Yahweh answered ? and , What has Yahweh spoken ?
you shall mention the burden of Yahweh no more : for every man 's own word shall be his burden ; for you have perverted the words of the living God , of Yahweh of Armies our God .
you shall say to the prophet , What has Yahweh answered you ? and , What has Yahweh spoken ?
but if you say , The burden of Yahweh ; therefore thus says Yahweh : because you say this word , The burden of Yahweh , and I have sent to you , saying , You shall not say , The burden of Yahweh ;
therefore , behold , I will utterly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers , away from my presence :
and I will bring an everlasting reproach on you , and a perpetual shame , which shall not be forgotten .
one basket had very good figs , like the figs that are first @-@ ripe ; and the other basket had very bad figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
then Yahweh said to me , What do you see , Jeremiah ? I said , figs ; the good figs , very good ; and the bad , very bad , that can 't be eaten , they are so bad .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : like these good figs , so will I regard the captives of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans , for good .
for I will set my eyes on them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pluck them up .
I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Yahweh : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God ; for they shall return to me with their whole heart .
I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil ; to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all places where I shall drive them .
I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among them , until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah ( the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) ,
which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah , and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying :
from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , even to this day , these twenty @-@ three years , the word of Yahweh has come to me , and I have spoken to you , rising up early and speaking ; but you have not listened .
Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not listened , nor inclined your ear to hear )
saying , Return now everyone from his evil way , and from the evil of your doings , and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers , from of old and even forevermore ;
and don 't go after other gods to serve them or worship them , and don 't provoke me to anger with the work of your hands ; and I will do you no harm .
yet you have not listened to me , says Yahweh ; that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies : because you have not heard my words ,
moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones , and the light of the lamp .
this whole land shall be a desolation , and an astonishment ; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years .
it shall happen , when seventy years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Babylon , and that nation , says Yahweh , for their iniquity , and the land of the Chaldeans ; and I will make it desolate forever .
I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations .
for many nations and great kings shall make bondservants of them , even of them ; and I will recompense them according to their deeds , and according to the work of their hands .
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , to me : take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send you , to drink it .
they shall drink , and reel back and forth , and be mad , because of the sword that I will send among them .
then took I the cup at Yahweh 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , to whom Yahweh had sent me :
Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and its kings , and its princes , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , a hissing , and a curse , as it is this day ;
Pharaoh king of Egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the Uz , and all the kings of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Gaza , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ;
and all the kings of Tyre , and all the kings of Sidon , and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea ;
Dedan , and TEMA , and Buz , and all who have the corners of their beard cut off ;
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness ;
and all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of the Medes ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the kingdoms of the world , which are on the surface of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink , then you shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh of Armies : you shall surely drink .
a noise shall come even to the end of the earth ; for Yahweh has a controversy with the nations ; he will enter into judgment with all flesh : as for the wicked , he will give them to the sword , says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great storm shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
the slain of Yahweh shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth : they shall not be lamented , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be Dung on the surface of the ground .
Wail , you shepherds , and cry ; and wallow in dust , you principal of the flock ; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come , and you shall fall like a goodly vessel .
the shepherds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and the wailing of the principal of the flock ! for Yahweh lays waste their pasture .
the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Yahweh .
he has left his covert , as the lion ; for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression , and because of his fierce anger .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word from Yahweh , saying ,
thus says Yahweh : stand in the court of Yahweh 's house , and speak to all the cities of Judah , which come to worship in Yahweh 's house , all the words that I command you to speak to them ; don 't diminish a word .
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his evil way ; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings .
you shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh : if you will not listen to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you ,
to listen to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I send to you , even rising up early and sending them , but you have not listened ;
then will I make this house like Shiloh , and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth .
the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Yahweh .
it happened , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him , saying , You shall surely die .
when the princes of Judah heard these things , they came up from the king 's house to the house of Yahweh ; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh 's house .
then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes and to all the people , saying , This man is worthy of death ; for he has prophesied against this city , as you have heard with your ears .
then spoke Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people , saying , Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard .
now therefore amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of Yahweh your God ; and Yahweh will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you .
but as for me , behold , I am in your hand : do with me as is good and right in your eyes .
then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets : this man is not worthy of death ; for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God .
then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spoke to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
there was also a man who prophesied in the name of Yahweh , Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim ; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah :
and when Jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when Uriah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt :
and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , Elnathan the son of Achbor , and certain men with him , into Egypt ;
and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt , and brought him to Jehoiakim the king , who killed him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
but the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
thus says Yahweh to me : make bonds and bars , and put them on your neck ;
and send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the children of Ammon , and to the king of Tyre , and to the king of Sidon , by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah ;
and give them a command to their masters , saying , Thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , You shall tell your masters :
I have made the earth , the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth , by my great power and by my outstretched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
all the nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the time of his own land come : and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondservant .
but as for you , don 't you listen to your prophets , nor to your diviners , nor to your dreams , nor to your soothsayers , nor to your sorcerers , who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon :
for they prophesy a lie to you , to remove you far from your land , and that I should drive you out , and you should perish .
I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words , saying , Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serve him and his people , and live .
why will you die , you and your people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
Don 't listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon ; for they prophesy a lie to you .
for I have not sent them , says Yahweh , but they prophesy falsely in my name ; that I may drive you out , and that you may perish , you , and the prophets who prophesy to you .
Don 't listen to them ; serve the king of Babylon , and live : why should this city become a desolation ?
yes , thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yahweh , and in the house of the king of Judah , and at Jerusalem :
they shall be carried to Babylon , and there shall they be , until the day that I visit them , says Yahweh ; then will I bring them up , and restore them to this place .
it happened the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , that Hananiah the son of Azzur , the prophet , who was of Gibeon , spoke to me in the house of Yahweh , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
thus speaks Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , saying , I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon .
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried to Babylon :
and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah , who went to Babylon , says Yahweh ; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon .
then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yahweh ,
nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears , and in the ears of all the people :
the prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
the prophet who prophesies of peace , when the word of the prophet shall happen , then shall the prophet be known , that Yahweh has truly sent him .
then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah 's neck , and broke it .
then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
go , and tell Hananiah , saying , Thus says Yahweh : you have broken the bars of wood ; but you have made in their place bars of iron .
then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet , Hear now , Hananiah : Yahweh has not sent you ; but you make this people to trust in a lie .
therefore thus says Yahweh , behold , I will send you away from off the surface of the earth : this year you shall die , because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh .
so Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month .
( after that Jeconiah the king , the queen mother , the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , the craftsmen , and the Smiths , had departed from Jerusalem ) ,
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) , saying ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , to all the captivity , whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon :
build houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat their fruit .
take wives , and father sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; and multiply there , and don 't be diminished .
seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive , and pray to Yahweh for it ; for in its peace you shall have peace .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : Don 't let your prophets who are in the midst of you , and your diviners , deceive you ; neither listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed .
for they prophesy falsely to you in my name : I have not sent them , says Yahweh .
for thus says Yahweh , After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon , I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
for I know the thoughts that I think toward you , says Yahweh , thoughts of peace , and not of evil , to give you hope and a future .
you shall call on me , and you shall go and pray to me , and I will listen to you .
you shall seek me , and find me , when you shall search for me with all your heart .
because you have said , Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon ;
thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne of David , and concerning all the people who dwell in this city , your brothers who haven 't gone forth with you into captivity ;
thus says Yahweh of Armies ; behold , I will send on them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like vile figs , that can 't be eaten , they are so bad .
because they have not listened to my words , says Yahweh , with which I sent to them my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ; but you would not hear , says Yahweh .
hear therefore the word of Yahweh , all you of the captivity , whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon .
concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak , saying ,
Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest , that there may be officers in the house of Yahweh , for every man who is mad , and makes himself a prophet , that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles .
now therefore , why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth , who makes himself a prophet to you ,
because he has sent to us in Babylon , saying , The captivity is long : build houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat their fruit ?
then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah , saying ,
send to all them of the captivity , saying , Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite : because Shemaiah has prophesied to you , and I didn 't send him , and he has caused you to trust in a lie ;
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
thus speaks Yahweh , the God of Israel , saying , Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book .
these are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah .
for thus says Yahweh : we have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
ask now , and see whether a man does travail with child : why do I see every man with his hands on his waist , as a woman in travail , and all faces are turned into paleness ?
Alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of Jacob 's trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it .
it shall come to pass in that day , says Yahweh of Armies , that I will break his yoke from off your neck , and will burst your bonds ; and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant ;
but they shall serve Yahweh their God , and David their king , whom I will raise up to them .
for thus says Yahweh , Your hurt is incurable , and your wound grievous .
there is none to plead your cause , that you may be bound up : you have no healing medicines .
all your lovers have forgotten you ; they don 't seek you : for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one , for the greatness of your iniquity , because your sins were increased .
why do you cry for your hurt ? your pain is incurable : for the greatness of your iniquity , because your sins were increased , I have done these things to you .
therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured ; and all your adversaries , everyone of them , shall go into captivity ; and those who despoil you shall be a spoil , and all who prey on you will I give for a prey .
for I will restore health to you , and I will heal you of your wounds , says Yahweh ; because they have called you an outcast , saying , It is Zion , whom no man seeks after .
thus says Yahweh : behold , I will turn again the captivity of Jacob 's tents , and have compassion on his dwelling places ; and the city shall be built on its own hill , and the palace shall be inhabited in its own way .
out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
their children also shall be as before , and their Congregation shall be established before me ; and I will punish all who oppress them .
their prince shall be of themselves , and their ruler shall proceed from their midst ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach to me : for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me ? says Yahweh .
you shall be my people , and I will be your God .
behold , the storm of Yahweh , his wrath , has gone forth , a sweeping storm : it shall burst on the head of the wicked .
the fierce anger of Yahweh will not return , until he has executed , and until he has performed the intentions of his heart . in the latter days you will understand it .
at that time , says Yahweh , will I be the God of all the families of Israel , and they shall be my people .
thus says Yahweh , The people who were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness ; even Israel , when I went to cause him to rest .
Yahweh appeared of old to me , saying , Yes , I have loved you with an everlasting love : therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you .
again will I build you , and you shall be built , O virgin of Israel : again you shall be adorned with your tambourines , and shall go forth in the dances of those who make merry .
again you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria ; the planters shall plant , and shall enjoy its fruit .
for there shall be a day , that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry , arise , and let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God .
for thus says Yahweh , sing with gladness for Jacob , and shout for the chief of the nations : publish , praise , and say , Yahweh , save your people , the remnant of Israel .
they shall come with weeping ; and with petitions will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters , in a straight way in which they shall not stumble ; for I am a father to Israel , and Ephraim is my firstborn .
hear the word of Yahweh , you nations , and declare it in the islands afar off ; and say , He who scattered Israel will gather him , and keep him , as shepherd does his flock .
for Yahweh has ransomed Jacob , and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , and the young men and the old together ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my Goodness , says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : a voice is heard in Ramah , lamentation , and bitter weeping , Rachel weeping for her children ; she refuses to be comforted for her children , because they are no more .
thus says Yahweh : refrain your voice from weeping , and your eyes from tears ; for your work shall be rewarded , says Yahweh ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
there is hope for your latter end , says Yahweh ; and your children shall come again to their own border .
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus , You have chastised me , and I was chastised , as an untrained calf : turn me , and I shall be turned ; for you are Yahweh my God .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I struck on my thigh : I was ashamed , yes , even confounded , because I bore the reproach of my youth .
set up road signs , make guideposts ; set your heart toward the highway , even the way by which you went : turn again , virgin of Israel , turn again to these your cities .
how long will you go here and there , you backsliding daughter ? for Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth : a woman shall encompass a man .
Judah and all its cities shall dwell therein together , the farmers , and those who go about with flocks .
for I have satiated the weary soul , and every sorrowful soul have I replenished .
on this I awakened , and saw ; and my sleep was sweet to me .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of animal .
it shall happen that , like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , says Yahweh .
in those days they shall say no more , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge .
but everyone shall die for his own iniquity : every man who eats the sour grapes , his teeth shall be set on edge .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my Covenant they broke , although I was a husband to them , says Yahweh .
if these ordinances depart from before me , says Yahweh , then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever .
thus says Yahweh : if heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , says Yahweh .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that the city shall be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner .
the measuring line shall go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb , and shall turn about to Goah .
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar .
now at that time the king of Babylon 's army was besieging Jerusalem ; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard , which was in the king of Judah 's house .
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall see his eyes ;
and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon , and he shall be there until I visit him , says Yahweh : though you fight with the Chaldeans , you shall not prosper ?
Jeremiah said , The word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
behold , Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you , saying , Buy my field that is in Anathoth ; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it .
I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle 's son , and weighed him the money , even seventeen shekels of silver .
I subscribed the deed , and sealed it , and called witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balances .
so I took the deed of the purchase , both that which was sealed , containing the terms and conditions , and that which was open ;
I commanded Baruch before them , saying ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : take these deeds , this deed of the purchase which is sealed , and this deed which is open , and put them in an earthen vessel ; that they may continue many days .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land .
now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah , I prayed to Yahweh , saying ,
Ah Lord Yahweh ! behold , you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm ; there is nothing too hard for you ,
who show loving kindness to thousands , and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them ; the great , the mighty God , Yahweh of Armies is his name ;
great in counsel , and mighty in work ; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men , to give everyone according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings :
who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , even to this day , both in Israel and among other men ; and made yourself a name , as in this day ;
and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror ;
and gave them this land , which you swore to their fathers to give them , a land flowing with milk and honey ;
you have said to me , Lord Yahweh , Buy the field for money , and call witnesses ; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans .
then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah , saying ,
behold , I am Yahweh , the God of all flesh : is there anything too hard for me ?
therefore thus says Yahweh : behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth ; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , says Yahweh .
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
they have turned to me the back , and not the face : and though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not listened to receive instruction .
but they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it .
now therefore thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , concerning this city , about which you say , It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence :
behold , I will gather them out of all the countries , where I have driven them in my anger , and in my wrath , and in great indignation ; and I will bring them again to this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and they shall be my people , and I will be their God :
and I will give them one heart and one way , that they may fear me forever , for their good , and of their children after them :
and I will make an everlasting Covenant with them , that I will not turn away from following them , to do them good ; and I will put my fear in their hearts , that they may not depart from me .
yes , I will rejoice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
for thus says Yahweh : like as I have brought all this great evil on this people , so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them .
fields shall be bought in this land , about which you say , It is desolate , without man or animal ; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
thus says Yahweh who does it , Yahweh who forms it to establish it ; Yahweh is his name :
call to me , and I will answer you , and will show you great things , and difficult , which you don 't know .
behold , I will bring it health and cure , and I will cure them ; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth .
I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , by which they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , by which they have sinned against me , and by which they have transgressed against me .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : yet again shall there be in this place , which is waste , without man and without animal , and in all its cities , a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
in the cities of the hill country , in the cities of the lowland , and in the cities of the South , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them , says Yahweh .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah .
in those days , and at that time , will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David ; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land .
in those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely ; and this is the name by which she shall be called : Yahweh our righteousness .
for thus says Yahweh : David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel ;
neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings , and to burn meal offerings , and to do sacrifice continually .
the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , saying ,
as the army of the sky can 't be numbered , neither the sand of the sea measured ; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant , and the Levites who minister to me .
the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , saying ,
Don 't consider what this people has spoken , saying , The two families which Yahweh chose , he has cast them off ? thus do they despise my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
thus says Yahweh : if my Covenant of day and night fails , if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth ;
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of it , saying :
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , Go , and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah , and tell him , Thus says Yahweh , behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
yet hear the word of Yahweh , O Zedekiah king of Judah : thus says Yahweh concerning you , You shall not die by the sword ;
then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem ,
when the king of Babylon 's army was fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish and against Azekah ; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities .
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that the king Zedekiah had made a Covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty to them ;
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess , go free ; that none should make bondservants of them , of a Jew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
therefore the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : I made a Covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage , saying ,
at the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew , who has been sold to you , and has served you six years , you shall let him go free from you : but your fathers didn 't listen to me , neither inclined their ear .
but you turned and profaned my name , and caused every man his servant , and every man his handmaid , whom you had let go free at their pleasure , to return ; and you brought them into subjection , to be to you for servants and for handmaids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life ; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky , and to the animals of the earth .
Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , who have gone away from you .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
go to the house of the Rechabites , and speak to them , and bring them into the house of Yahweh , into one of the rooms , and give them wine to drink .
then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , and his brothers , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ;
I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine , and cups ; and I said to them , Drink wine !
neither shall you build house , nor sow seed , nor plant vineyard , nor have any ; but all your days you shall dwell in tents ; that you may live many days in the land in which you live .
we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , in all that he commanded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , or our daughters ;
nor to build houses for us to dwell in ; neither have we vineyard , nor field , nor seed :
but we have lived in tents , and have obeyed , and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us .
but it happened , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians ; so we dwell at Jerusalem .
then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah , saying ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : go , and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words ? says Yahweh .
because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them , but this people has not listened to me ;
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me forever .
it happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , that this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
take a scroll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spoke to you , from the days of Josiah , even to this day .
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
Jeremiah commanded Baruch , saying , I am shut up ; I can 't go into the house of Yahweh :
therefore you go , and read in the scroll , which you have written from my mouth , the words of Yahweh in the ears of the people in Yahweh 's house on the fast day ; and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities .
it may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh , and will return everyone from his evil way ; for great is the anger and the wrath that Yahweh has pronounced against this people .
Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him , reading in the book the words of Yahweh in Yahweh 's house .
now it happened in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , in the ninth month , that all the people in Jerusalem , and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem , proclaimed a fast before Yahweh .
then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh , in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan , the scribe , in the upper court , at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh 's house , in the ears of all the people .
when Micaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of Yahweh ,
he went down into the king 's house , into the scribe 's room : and behold , all the princes were sitting there , Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the son of Achbor , and Gemariah the son of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the princes .
then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
they said to him , sit down now , and read it in our ears . so Baruch read it in their ears .
now it happened , when they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said to Baruch , We will surely tell the king of all these words .
they asked Baruch , saying , Tell us now , How did you write all these words at his mouth ?
then Baruch answered them , He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth , and I wrote them with ink in the book .
then the princes said to Baruch , Go , hide , you and Jeremiah ; and let no man know where you are .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe ; and they told all the words in the ears of the king .
so the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll ; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe . Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king .
now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him .
it happened , when Jehudi had read three or four leaves , that the king cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier , until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier .
they were not afraid , nor tore their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants who heard all these words .
moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll ; but he would not hear them .
the king commanded Jerahmeel the king 's son , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet ; but Yahweh hid them .
then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the scroll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
take again another scroll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll , which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned .
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah : he shall have none to sit on the throne of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the Frost .
Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king , instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , listened to the words of Yahweh , which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah .
Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah , the priest , to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , pray now to Yahweh our God for us .
now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people ; for they had not put him into prison .
Pharaoh 's army had come forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them , they broke up from Jerusalem .
then came the word of Yahweh to the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , You shall tell the king of Judah , who sent you to me to inquire of me : behold , Pharaoh 's army , which has come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
the Chaldeans shall come again , and fight against this city ; and they shall take it , and burn it with fire .
thus says Yahweh , Don 't deceive yourselves , saying , The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us ; for they shall not depart .
for though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yes would they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
it happened that , when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
then Jeremiah said , It is false ; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans . but he didn 't listen to him ; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah , and brought him to the princes .
the princes were angry with Jeremiah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe ; for they had made that the prison .
when Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house , and into the cells , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ;
moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah , Wherein have I sinned against you , or against your servants , or against this people , that you have put me in prison ?
where now are your prophets who prophesied to you , saying , The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
now please hear , my lord the king : please let my supplication be presented before you , that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there .
Shephatiah the son of Mattan , and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur , and Jucal the son of Shelemiah , and Pashhur the son of Malchijah , heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people , saying ,
thus says Yahweh , He who remains in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live , and his life shall be to him for a prey , and he shall live .
thus says Yahweh , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it .
Zedekiah the king said , behold , he is in your hand ; for the king is not he who can do anything against you .
then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king 's son , that was in the court of the guard : and they let down Jeremiah with cords . in the dungeon there was no water , but mire ; and Jeremiah sank in the mire .
now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , a eunuch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
Ebedmelech went forth out of the king 's house , and spoke to the king , saying ,
my lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he is likely to die in the place where he is , because of the famine ; for there is no more bread in the city .
then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , saying , Take from here thirty men with you , and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon , before he dies .
so Ebedmelech took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took there rags and worn @-@ out garments , and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah , Put now these rags and worn @-@ out garments under your armpits under the cords . Jeremiah did so .
so they drew up Jeremiah with the cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh : and the king said to Jeremiah , I will ask you something . hide nothing from me .
then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , If I declare it to you , will you not surely put me to death ? and if I give you counsel , you will not listen to me .
but if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and you shall not escape out of their hand .
Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah , I am afraid of the Jews who are fallen away to the Chaldeans , lest they deliver me into their hand , and they mock me .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver you . obey , I beg you , the voice of Yahweh , in that which I speak to you : so it shall be well with you , and your soul shall live .
but if you refuse to go forth , this is the word that Yahweh has shown me :
they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , Let no man know of these words , and you shall not die .
then you shall tell them , I presented my supplication before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan 's house , to die there .
then came all the princes to Jeremiah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
so Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken .
it happened when Jerusalem was taken , ( in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and besieged it ;
in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , a breach was made in the city ) ,
it happened that , when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's garden , through the gate between the two walls ; and he went out toward the Arabah .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath ; and he gave judgment on him .
then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah .
moreover he put out Zedekiah 's eyes , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to Babylon .
the Chaldeans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city , the deserters also who fell away to him , and the residue of the people who remained .
but Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah , saying ,
take him , and look well to him , and do him no harm ; but do to him even as he shall tell you .
so Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent , and Nebushazban , Rabsaris , and Nergal Sharezer , Rabmag , and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon ;
they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
now the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yahweh ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will surely save you , and you shall not fall by the sword , but your life shall be for a prey to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yahweh .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah , who were carried away captive to Babylon .
the captain of the guard took Jeremiah , and said to him , Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place ;
and Yahweh has brought it , and done according as he spoke : because you have sinned against Yahweh , and have not obeyed his voice , therefore this thing has come on you .
then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah , and lived with him among the people who were left in the land .
now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed to him men , and women , and children , and of the poorest of the land , of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon ;
then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite , they and their men .
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men , saying , Don 't be afraid to serve the Chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
as for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah , to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us : but you , gather wine and summer fruits and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that you have taken .
likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab , and among the children of Ammon , and in Edom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan ;
then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven , and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah , to Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits very much .
moreover Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields , came to Gedaliah to Mizpah ,
and said to him , Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life ? but Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn 't believe them .
but Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah , You shall not do this thing ; for you speak falsely of Ishmael .
now it happened in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king , and ten men with him , came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah .
then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men who were with him , and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword , and killed him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him , with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans who were found there , the men of war .
it happened the second day after he had killed Gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men who were with him .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
now it happened that , when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
so all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back , and went to Johanan the son of Kareah .
but Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men , and went to the children of Ammon .
that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk , and the thing that we should do .
then Jeremiah the prophet said to them , I have heard you ; behold , I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words ; and it shall happen that whatever thing Yahweh shall answer you , I will declare it to you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
then they said to Jeremiah , Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us , if we don 't do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God shall send you to us .
whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God , to whom we send you ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God .
it happened after ten days , that the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
and said to them , Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him :
if you will still live in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pluck you up ; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you .
Don 't be afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom you are afraid ; don 't be afraid of him , says Yahweh : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
I will grant you mercy , that he may have mercy on you , and cause you to return to your own land .
but if you say , We will not dwell in this land ; so that you don 't obey the voice of Yahweh your God ,
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
now therefore hear the word of Yahweh , O remnant of Judah : thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to live there ;
then it shall happen , that the sword , which you fear , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt ; and the famine , about which you are afraid , shall follow close behind you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
so shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there : they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them .
Yahweh has spoken concerning you , remnant of Judah , Don 't you go into Egypt : know certainly that I have testified to you this day .
for you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls ; for you sent me to Yahweh your God , saying , pray for us to Yahweh our God ; and according to all that Yahweh our God shall say , so declare to us , and we will do it :
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place where you desire to go to live there .
it happened that , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God , with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they may put us to death , and carry us away captive to Babylon .
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Judah ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh : and they came to Tahpanhes .
then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes , saying ,
take great stones in your hand , and hide them in mortar in the brick work , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
he shall also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh , that is in the land of Egypt ; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt , who lived at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Memphis , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
however I sent to you all my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them , saying , Oh , don 't do this abominable thing that I hate .
but they didn 't listen , nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness , to burn no incense to other gods .
therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth , and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and desolate , as it is this day .
have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of Judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
they are not humbled even to this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will set my face against you for evil , even to cut off all Judah .
for I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods , and all the women who stood by , a great assembly , even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt , in Pathros , answered Jeremiah , saying ,
as for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh , we will not listen to you .
but since we left off burning incense to the queen of the sky , and pouring out drink offerings to her , we have wanted all things , and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine .
then Jeremiah said to all the people , to the men , and to the women , even to all the people who had given him an answer , saying ,
so that Yahweh could no longer bear , because of the evil of your doings , and because of the abominations which you have committed ; therefore your land has become a desolation , and an astonishment , and a curse , without inhabitant , as it is this day .
moreover Jeremiah said to all the people , and to all the women , Hear the word of Yahweh , all Judah who are in the land of Egypt :
behold , I watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until they are all gone .
this shall be the sign to you , says Yahweh , that I will punish you in this place , that you may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil :
the message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah , when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , to you , Baruch :
you said , Woe is me now ! for Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain ; I am weary with my groaning , and I find no rest .
you shall tell him , Thus says Yahweh : behold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have planted I will pluck up ; and this in the whole land .
the word of Yahweh which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations .
of Egypt : concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah .
prepare the buckler and shield , and draw near to battle !
harness the horses , and get up , you horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , put on the coats of mail .
why have I seen it ? they are dismayed and are turned backward ; and their mighty ones are beaten down , and have fled Apace , and don 't look back : terror is on every side , says Yahweh .
Don 't let the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen .
who is this who rises up like the Nile , whose waters Toss themselves like the rivers ?
Egypt rises up like the Nile , and his waters Toss themselves like the rivers : and he says , I will rise up , I will cover the earth ; I will destroy cities and its inhabitants .
go up , you horses ; and rage , you chariots ; and let the mighty men go forth : Cush and Put , who handle the shield ; and the Ludim , who handle and bend the bow .
go up into Gilead , and take balm , virgin daughter of Egypt : in vain do you use many medicines ; there is no healing for you .
the nations have heard of your shame , and the earth is full of your cry ; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty , they are fallen both of them together .
the word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet , how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt .
declare in Egypt , and publish in Migdol , and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes : say , Stand forth , and prepare ; for the sword has devoured around you .
he made many to stumble , yes , they fell one on another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our birth , from the oppressing sword .
they cried there , Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise ; he has let the appointed time pass by .
as I live , says the King , whose name is Yahweh of Armies , surely like Tabor among the mountains , and like Carmel by the sea , so shall he come .
you daughter who dwells in Egypt , furnish yourself to go into captivity ; for Memphis shall become a desolation , and shall be burnt up , without inhabitant .
Egypt is a very beautiful heifer ; but destruction out of the north has come , it has come .
also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall ; for they also are turned back , they are fled away together , they didn 't stand : for the day of their calamity has come on them , the time of their visitation .
the sound of it shall go like the serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as wood cutters .
they shall cut down her forest , says Yahweh , though it can 't be searched ; because they are more than the locusts , and are innumerable .
the daughter of Egypt shall be disappointed ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , says : behold , I will punish Amon of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , with her gods , and her kings ; even Pharaoh , and those who trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants ; and afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , says Yahweh .
but don 't you be afraid , Jacob my servant , neither be dismayed , Israel : for , behold , I will save you from afar , and your seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and shall be quiet and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines , before that Pharaoh struck Gaza .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones , at the rushing of his chariots , at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers don 't look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
Baldness has come on Gaza ; Ashkelon is brought to nothing , the remnant of their valley : how long will you cut yourself ?
you sword of Yahweh , how long will it be before you be quiet ? put up yourself into your scabbard ; rest , and be still .
how can you be quiet , since Yahweh has given you a command ? against Ashkelon , and against the seashore , there has he appointed it .
of Moab . thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : Woe to Nebo ! for it is laid waste ; Kiriathaim is disappointed , it is taken ; Misgab is put to shame and broken down .
the sound of a cry from Horonaim , desolation and great destruction !
Moab is destroyed ; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard .
for by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up ; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction .
flee , save your lives , and be like the heath in the wilderness .
for , because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures , you also shall be taken : and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity , his priests and his princes together .
the destroyer shall come on every city , and no city shall escape ; the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed ; as Yahweh has spoken .
give wings to Moab , that she may fly and get her away : and her cities shall become a desolation , without any to dwell therein .
Cursed is he who does the work of Yahweh negligently ; and Cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood .
Moab has been at ease from his youth , and he has settled on his lees , and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither has he gone into captivity : therefore his taste remains in him , and his scent is not changed .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will send to him those who pour off , and they shall pour him off ; and they shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles in pieces .
Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh , as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence .
how do you say , We are mighty men , and valiant men for the war ?
Moab is laid waste , and they are gone up into his cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , says the King , whose name is Yahweh of Armies .
the calamity of Moab is near to come , and his affliction hurries fast .
all you who are around him , bemoan him , and all you who know his name ; say , How is the strong staff broken , the beautiful rod !
you daughter who dwells in Dibon , come down from your glory , and sit in thirst ; for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you , he has destroyed your strongholds .
inhabitant of Aroer , stand by the way , and watch : ask him who flees , and her who escapes ; say , What has been done ?
Moab is disappointed ; for it is broken down : wail and cry ; tell it by the Arnon , that Moab is laid waste .
judgment has come on the plain country , on Holon , and on Jahzah , and on Mephaath ,
the Horn of Moab is cut off , and his arm is broken , says Yahweh .
make him drunken ; for he magnified himself against Yahweh : and Moab shall wallow in his vomit , and he also shall be in derision .
for wasn 't Israel a derision to you ? was he found among thieves ? for as often as you speak of him , you shake your head .
you inhabitants of Moab , leave the cities , and dwell in the rock ; and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss .
we have heard of the pride of Moab . he is very proud ; his loftiness , and his pride , and his arrogance , and the haughtiness of his heart .
I know his wrath , says Yahweh , that it is nothing ; his boastings have worked nothing .
therefore will I wail for Moab ; yes , I will cry out for all Moab : for the men of Kir Heres shall they mourn .
with more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for you , vine of Sibmah : your branches passed over the sea , they reached even to the sea of Jazer : on your summer fruits and on your vintage the destroyer is fallen .
from the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh , even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice , from Zoar even to Horonaim , to Eglath Shelishiyah : for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate .
moreover I will cause to cease in Moab , says Yahweh , him who offers in the high place , and him who burns incense to his gods .
therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes , and my heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir Heres : therefore the abundance that he has gotten is perished .
for every head is bald , and every beard clipped : on all the hands are cuttings , and on the waist sackcloth .
on all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation every where ; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which none delights , says Yahweh .
how it is broken down ! how they wail ! how Moab has turned the back with shame ! so shall Moab become a derision and a terror to all who are around him .
for thus says Yahweh : behold , he shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread out his wings against Moab .
Kerioth is taken , and the strongholds are seized , and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
Moab shall be destroyed from being a people , because he has magnified himself against Yahweh .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , are on you , inhabitant of Moab , says Yahweh .
he who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring on him , even on Moab , the year of their visitation , says Yahweh .
those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon ; for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon , and a flame from the midst of Sihon , and has devoured the corner of Moab , and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones .
Woe to you , O Moab ! the people of Chemosh is undone ; for your sons are taken away captive , and your daughters into captivity .
yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days , says Yahweh . thus far is the judgment of Moab .
of the children of Ammon . thus says Yahweh : has Israel no sons ? has he no heir ? why then does Malcam possess Gad , and his people well in its cities ?
why do you glory in the valleys , your flowing valley , backsliding daughter ? who trusted in her treasures , saying , Who shall come to me ?
behold , I will bring a fear on you , says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , from all who are around you ; and you shall be driven out every man right forth , and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives .
but afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon , says Yahweh .
of Edom . thus says Yahweh of Armies : is wisdom no more in Teman ? is counsel perished from the prudent ? is their wisdom vanished ?
flee , turn back , dwell in the depths , inhabitants of Dedan ; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him , the time that I shall visit him .
if grape gatherers came to you , would they not leave some gleaning grapes ? if thieves by night , wouldn 't they destroy until they had enough ?
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neighbors ; and he is no more .
leave your fatherless children , I will preserve them alive ; and let your widows trust in me .
for thus says Yahweh : behold , they to whom it didn 't pertain to drink of the cup shall certainly drink ; and are you he who shall altogether go unpunished ? you shall not go unpunished , but you shall surely drink .
for I have sworn by myself , says Yahweh , that Bozrah shall become an astonishment , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes .
I have heard news from Yahweh , and an ambassador is sent among the nations , saying , Gather yourselves together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
for , behold , I have made you small among the nations , and despised among men .
Edom shall become an astonishment : everyone who passes by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss at all its plagues .
as in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it , says Yahweh , no man shall dwell there , neither shall any son of man live therein .
therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh , that he has taken against Edom ; and his purposes , that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : surely they shall drag them away , the little ones of the flock ; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them .
the earth trembles at the noise of their fall ; there is a cry , the noise which is heard in the Red Sea .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread out his wings against Bozrah : and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
of Damascus . Hamath is confounded , and Arpad ; for they have heard evil news , they are melted away : there is sorrow on the sea ; it can 't be quiet .
Damascus has grown feeble , she turns herself to flee , and trembling has seized on her : anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her , as of a woman in travail .
how is the city of praise not forsaken , the city of my joy ?
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day , says Yahweh of Armies .
I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus , and it shall devour the palaces of Ben Hadad .
of Kedar , and of the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck . thus says Yahweh : arise , go up to Kedar , and destroy the children of the east .
their tents and their flocks shall they take ; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their camels ; and they shall cry to them , Terror on every side !
flee , wander far off , dwell in the depths , you inhabitants of Hazor , says Yahweh ; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you , and has conceived a purpose against you .
arise , go up to a nation that is at ease , that dwells without care , says Yahweh ; that have neither gates nor bars , that dwell alone .
their camels shall be a booty , and the multitude of their livestock a spoil : and I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their beards cut off ; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them , says Yahweh .
Hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals , a desolation forever : no man shall dwell there , neither shall any son of man live therein .
the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies : behold , I will break the bow of Elam , the chief of their might .
on Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come .
and I will set my throne in Elam , and will destroy from there king and princes , says Yahweh .
but it shall happen in the latter days , that I will bring back the captivity of Elam , says Yahweh .
the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon , concerning the land of the Chaldeans , by Jeremiah the prophet .
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
in those days , and in that time , says Yahweh , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Judah together ; they shall go on their way weeping , and shall seek Yahweh their God .
they shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it , saying , Come , and join yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting Covenant that shall not be forgotten .
my people have been lost sheep : their shepherds have caused them to go astray ; they have turned them away on the mountains ; they have gone from mountain to hill ; they have forgotten their resting place .
all who found them have devoured them ; and their adversaries said , We are not guilty , because they have sinned against Yahweh , the habitation of righteousness , even Yahweh , the hope of their fathers .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans , and be as the male goats before the flocks .
Chaldea shall be a prey : all who prey on her shall be satisfied , says Yahweh .
because you are glad , because you rejoice , O you who plunder my heritage , because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain , and neigh as strong horses ;
your mother shall be utterly disappointed ; she who bore you shall be confounded : behold , she shall be the least of the nations , a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited , but she shall be wholly desolate : everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .
set yourselves in array against Babylon all around , all you who bend the bow ; shoot at her , spare no arrows : for she has sinned against Yahweh .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
Israel is a hunted sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first , the king of Assyria devoured him ; and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
I will bring Israel again to his pasture , and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan , and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead .
in those days , and in that time , says Yahweh , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Judah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant .
go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : kill and utterly destroy after them , says Yahweh , and do according to all that I have commanded you .
a sound of battle is in the land , and of great destruction .
how is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken ! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations !
I have laid a snare for you , and you are also taken , Babylon , and you weren 't aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have striven against Yahweh .
Yahweh has opened his armory , and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation ; for the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans .
come against her from the utmost border ; open her storehouses ; cast her up as heaps , and destroy her utterly ; let nothing of her be left .
kill all her bulls ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe to them ! for their day has come , the time of their visitation .
the voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God , the vengeance of his temple .
therefore her young men will fall in her streets , and all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day , says Yahweh .
behold , I am against you , you proud one , says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies ; for your day has come , the time that I will visit you .
the proud one shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up ; and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all who are around him .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : the children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together ; and all who took them captive hold them fast ; they refuse to let them go .
their Redeemer is strong ; Yahweh of Armies is his name : he will thoroughly plead their cause , that he may give rest to the earth , and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon .
a sword is on the Chaldeans , says Yahweh , and on the inhabitants of Babylon , and on her princes , and on her wise men .
a sword is on the boasters , and they shall become fools ; a sword is on her mighty men , and they shall be dismayed .
a sword is on their horses , and on their chariots , and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is on her treasures , and they shall be robbed .
a drought is on her waters , and they shall be dried up ; for it is a land of engraved images , and they are mad over idols .
therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there , and the ostriches shall dwell therein : and it shall be no more inhabited forever ; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation .
as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it , says Yahweh , so shall no man dwell there , neither shall any son of man live therein .
behold , a people comes from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
they lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roars like the sea ; and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Babylon .
the king of Babylon has heard the news of them , and his hands wax feeble : anguish has taken hold of him , pains as of a woman in labor .
therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh , that he has taken against Babylon ; and his purposes , that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans : surely they shall drag them away , even the little ones of the flock ; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them .
at the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles , and the cry is heard among the nations .
thus says Yahweh : behold , I will raise up against Babylon , and against those who dwell in Lebkamai , a destroying wind .
I will send to Babylon strangers , who shall winnow her ; and they shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around .
against him who bends let the archer bend his bow , and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail : and don 't spare her young men ; utterly destroy all her army .
they shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans , and thrust through in her streets .
for Israel is not forsaken , nor Judah , of his God , of Yahweh of Armies ; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don 't be cut off in her iniquity : for it is the time of Yahweh 's vengeance ; he will render to her a recompense .
Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh 's hand , who made all the earth drunken : the nations have drunk of her wine ; therefore the nations are mad .
Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed : wail for her ; take balm for her pain , if so be she may be healed .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go everyone into his own country ; for her judgment reaches to heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
Yahweh has brought forth our righteousness : come , and let us declare in Zion the work of Yahweh our God .
make sharp the arrows ; hold firm the shields : Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes ; because his purpose is against Babylon , to destroy it : for it is the vengeance of Yahweh , the vengeance of his temple .
you who dwell on many waters , abundant in treasures , your end has come , the measure of your covetousness .
Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself , saying , surely I will fill you with men , as with the canker worm ; and they shall lift up a shout against you .
he has made the earth by his power , he has established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens :
when he utters his voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens , and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he makes lightning for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries .
every man has become brutish without knowledge . every goldsmith is disappointed by his image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
they are vanity , a work of delusion : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
the portion of Jacob is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and is the tribe of his inheritance : Yahweh of Armies is his name .
you are my battle axe and weapons of war : and with you will I break in pieces the nations ; and with you will I destroy kingdoms ;
and with you will I break in pieces the horse and his Rider ;
and with you will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock ; and with you will I break in pieces the farmer and his yoke ; and with you will I break in pieces governors and deputies .
I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight , says Yahweh .
behold , I am against you , destroying mountain , says Yahweh , which destroys all the earth ; and I will stretch out my hand on you , and roll you down from the rocks , and will make you a burnt mountain .
they shall not take of you a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but you shall be desolate for ever , says Yahweh .
prepare against her the nations , the kings of the Medes , its governors , and all its deputies , and all the land of their dominion .
the land trembles and is in pain ; for the purposes of Yahweh against Babylon do stand , to make the land of Babylon a desolation , without inhabitant .
the mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight , they remain in their strongholds ; their might has failed ; they are become as women : her dwelling places are set on fire ; her bars are broken .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : the daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden ; yet a little while , and the time of harvest shall come for her .
therefore thus says Yahweh : behold , I will plead your cause , and take vengeance for you ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her fountain dry .
Babylon shall become heaps , a dwelling place for jackals , an astonishment , and a hissing , without inhabitant .
they shall roar together like young lions ; they shall growl as lions ' cubs .
when they are heated , I will make their feast , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , says Yahweh .
I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter , like rams with male goats .
how is Sheshach taken ! and the praise of the whole earth seized ! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations !
the sea has come up on Babylon ; she is covered with the multitude of its waves .
her cities are become a desolation , a dry land , and a desert , a land in which no man dwells , neither does any son of man pass thereby .
I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon , and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up ; and the nations shall not flow any more to him : yes , the wall of Babylon shall fall .
my people , go away from the midst of her , and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Yahweh .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be confounded ; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
then the heavens and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for joy over Babylon ; for the destroyers shall come to her from the north , says Yahweh .
as Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall , so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land .
you who have escaped the sword , go , don 't stand still ; remember Yahweh from afar , and let Jerusalem come into your mind .
we are confounded , because we have heard reproach ; confusion has covered our faces : for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Yahweh 's house .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will execute judgment on her engraved images ; and through all her land the wounded shall groan .
though Babylon should mount up to the sky , and though she should fortify the height of her strength , yet from me shall destroyers come to her , says Yahweh .
the sound of a cry from Babylon , and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans !
for Yahweh lays Babylon waste , and destroys out of her the great voice ; and their waves roar like many waters ; the noise of their voice is uttered :
for the destroyer has come on her , even on Babylon , and her mighty men are taken , their bows are broken in pieces ; for Yahweh is a God of recompenses , he will surely requite .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : the broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the peoples shall labor for vanity , and the nations for the fire ; and they shall be weary .
Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon , even all these words that are written concerning Babylon .
Jeremiah said to Seraiah , When you come to Babylon , then see that you read all these words ,
and say , Yahweh , you have spoken concerning this place , to cut it off , that none shall dwell therein , neither man nor animal , but that it shall be desolate forever .
it shall be , when you have made an end of reading this book , that you shall bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates :
and you shall say , Thus shall Babylon sink , and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her ; and they shall be weary . thus far are the words of Jeremiah .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of Yahweh it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and encamped against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
so the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah .
in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath ; and he gave judgment on him .
the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes : he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem :
and he burned the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
all the army of the Chaldeans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around .
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people , and the residue of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Babylon , and the residue of the multitude .
but Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers .
the Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
they also took away the pots , the shovels , the snuffers , the basins , the spoons , and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered .
the captain of the guard took away the cups , the fire pans , the basins , the pots , the lampstands , the spoons , and the bowls ; that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
they took the two pillars , the one sea , and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh . the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
as for the pillars , the height of the one pillar was Eighteen cubits ; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it ; and its thickness was four fingers . it was hollow .
a capital of brass was on it ; and the height of the one capital was five cubits , with network and pomegranates on the capital all around , all of brass : and the second pillar also had like these , and pomegranates .
there were ninety @-@ six pomegranates on the sides ; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around .
the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the threshold :
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
this is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand twenty @-@ three Jews ;
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty @-@ two persons ;
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty @-@ five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and he spoke kindly to him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon ,
and changed his prison garments . Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life :
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
how the city sits solitary , that was full of people ! she has become as a widow , who was great among the nations ! she who was a princess among the provinces has become tributary !
she weeps bitterly in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they are become her enemies .
Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude ; she dwells among the nations , she finds no rest : all her persecutors overtook her within the straits .
the ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn assembly ; all her gates are desolate , her priests do sigh : her virgins are afflicted , and she herself is in bitterness .
her adversaries are become the head , her enemies prosper ; for Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions : her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary .
from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
Jerusalem has grievously sinned ; therefore she has become as an unclean thing ; all who honored her despise her , because they have seen her nakedness : yes , she sighs , and turns backward .
her filthiness was in her skirts ; she didn 't remember her latter end ; therefore is she come down wonderfully ; she has no comforter : see , Yahweh , my affliction ; for the enemy has magnified himself .
the adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary , concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly .
all her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul : look , Yahweh , and see ; for I am become abject .
from on high has he sent fire into my bones , and it prevails against them ; He has spread a net for my feet , he has turned me back : he has made me desolate and faint all the day .
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand ; They are knit together , they have come up on my neck ; he has made my strength to fail : the Lord has delivered me into their hands , against whom I am not able to stand .
for these things I weep ; my eye , my eye runs down with water ; Because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me : my children are desolate , because the enemy has prevailed .
Zion spreads forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ; Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob , that those who are around him should be his adversaries : Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing .
Yahweh is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment : please hear all you peoples , and see my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city , While they sought them food to refresh their souls .
let all their wickedness come before you ; Do to them , as you have done to me for all my transgressions : for my sighs are many , and my heart is faint .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger ! he has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel , And hasn 't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger .
the Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob , and has not pitied : he has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah ; He has brought them down to the ground ; he has profaned the kingdom and its princes .
he has cut off in fierce anger all the Horn of Israel ; He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy : he has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire , which devours all around .
he has bent his bow like an enemy , he has stood with his right hand as an adversary , Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye : in the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like fire .
the Lord has become as an enemy , he has swallowed up Israel ; He has swallowed up all her palaces , he has destroyed his strongholds ; He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
the Lord has cast off his altar , he has abhorred his sanctuary ; He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces : they have made a noise in the house of Yahweh , as in the day of a solemn assembly .
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he has destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not ; Yes , her prophets find no vision from Yahweh .
the elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground , they keep silence ; They have cast up dust on their heads ; they have clothed themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
my eyes do fail with tears , my heart is troubled ; My liver is poured on the earth , because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , Because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city .
they tell their mothers , Where is grain and wine ? when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city , When their soul is poured out into their mothers ' bosom .
your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions ; They have not uncovered your iniquity , to bring back your captivity , but have seen for you false oracles and causes of banishment .
all your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you ; They hiss and gnash the teeth ; they say , We have swallowed her up ; Certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
Yahweh has done that which he purposed ; he has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old ; He has thrown down , and has not pitied : he has caused the enemy to rejoice over you ; he has exalted the Horn of your adversaries .
their heart cried to the Lord : Wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night ; Give yourself no respite ; don 't let the apple of your eye cease .
arise , cry out in the night , at the beginning of the watches ; pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children , that faint for hunger at the head of every street .
look , Yahweh , and see to whom you have done thus ! shall the women eat their fruit , the children that are dandled in the hands ? shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword : you have killed them in the day of your anger ; you have slaughtered , and not pitied .
I am the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath .
he has led me and caused me to walk in darkness , and not in light .
surely against me he turns his hand again and again all the day .
my flesh and my skin has he made old ; he has broken my bones .
he has built against me , and surrounded me with gall and travail .
he has made me to dwell in dark places , as those that have been long dead .
he has walled me about , that I can 't go forth ; he has made my chain heavy .
yes , when I cry , and call for help , he shuts out my prayer .
he has walled up my ways with cut stone ; he has made my paths crooked .
he is to me as a bear lying in wait , as a lion in secret places .
he has turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces ; he has made me desolate .
he has bent his bow , and set me as a mark for the arrow .
he has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys .
I am become a derision to all my people , and their song all the day .
he has filled me with bitterness , he has sated me with wormwood .
he has also broken my teeth with gravel stones ; he has covered me with ashes .
you have removed my soul far off from peace ; I forgot prosperity .
I said , My strength is perished , and my expectation from Yahweh .
remember my affliction and my misery , the wormwood and the gall .
my soul still remembers them , and is bowed down within me .
this I recall to my mind ; therefore have I hope .
it is because of Yahweh 's loving kindnesses that we are not consumed , because his compassion doesn 't fail .
they are new every morning ; great is your faithfulness .
Yahweh is my portion , says my soul ; therefore will I hope in him .
Yahweh is good to those who wait for him , to the soul that seeks him .
it is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh .
it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth .
let him sit alone and keep silence , because he has laid it on him .
let him put his mouth in the dust , if so be there may be hope .
let him give his cheek to him who strikes him ; let him be filled full with reproach .
for the Lord will not cast off forever .
for though he cause grief , yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses .
for he does not afflict willingly , nor grieve the children of men .
to crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth ,
to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High ,
to subvert a man in his cause , the Lord doesn 't approve .
who is he who says , and it comes to pass , when the Lord doesn 't command it ?
Doesn 't evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High ?
why does a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ?
let us search and try our ways , and turn again to Yahweh .
let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens .
we have transgressed and have rebelled ; you have not pardoned .
you have covered with anger and pursued us ; you have killed , you have not pitied .
you have covered yourself with a cloud , so that no prayer can pass through .
you have made us an off @-@ scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples .
all our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us .
fear and the pit have come on us , devastation and destruction .
my eye runs down with streams of water , for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
my eye pours down , and doesn 't cease , without any intermission ,
until Yahweh look down , and see from heaven .
my eye affects my soul , because of all the daughters of my city .
they have chased me relentlessly like a bird , those who are my enemies without cause .
they have cut off my life in the dungeon , and have cast a stone on me .
waters flowed over my head ; I said , I am cut off .
I called on your name , Yahweh , out of the lowest dungeon .
you heard my voice ; don 't hide your ear at my breathing , at my cry .
you drew near in the day that I called on you ; you said , Don 't be afraid .
Lord , you have pleaded the causes of my soul ; you have redeemed my life .
Yahweh , you have seen my wrong . judge my cause .
you have seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me .
you have heard their reproach , Yahweh , and all their devices against me ,
you see their sitting down , and their rising up ; I am their song .
you will render to them a recompense , Yahweh , according to the work of their hands .
you will give them hardness of heart , your curse to them .
you will pursue them in anger , and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh .
how the gold has become dim ! the most pure gold has changed ! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street .
the precious sons of Zion , comparable to fine gold , How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the Potter !
even the jackals draw out the breast , they nurse their young ones : the daughter of my people has become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
the tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
those who fed delicately are desolate in the streets : those who were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills .
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
her nobles were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk ; They were more ruddy in body than rubies , their polishing was as of sapphire .
their appearance is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin clings to their bones ; it is withered , it has become like a stick .
those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these pine away , stricken through , for want of the fruits of the field .
the hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Yahweh has accomplished his wrath , he has poured out his fierce anger ; He has kindled a fire in Zion , which has devoured its foundations .
the kings of the earth didn 't believe , neither all the inhabitants of the world , That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem .
it is because of the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her .
they wander as blind men in the streets , they are polluted with blood , So that men can 't touch their garments .
depart ! they cried to them , Unclean ! depart , depart , don 't touch ! when they fled away and wandered , men said among the nations , They shall not live here any more .
the anger of Yahweh has scattered them ; he will no more regard them : they didn 't respect the persons of the priests , they didn 't favor the elders .
our eyes still fail , looking in vain for our help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save .
they hunt our steps , so that we can 't go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end has come .
our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky : they chased us on the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
the breath of our nostrils , the anointed of Yahweh , was taken in their pits ; Of whom we said , Under his shadow we shall live among the nations .
rejoice and be glad , daughter of Edom , that dwell in the land of Uz : the cup shall pass through to you also ; you shall be drunken , and shall make yourself naked .
the punishment of your iniquity is accomplished , daughter of Zion ; he will no more carry you away into captivity : he will visit your iniquity , daughter of Edom ; he will uncover your sins .
remember , Yahweh , what has come on us : look , and see our reproach .
our inheritance is turned to strangers , Our houses to aliens .
we are orphans and fatherless ; Our mothers are as widows .
we have drunken our water for money ; Our wood is sold to us .
our pursuers are on our necks : we are weary , and have no rest .
we have given the hand to the Egyptians , To the Assyrians , to be satisfied with bread .
our fathers sinned , and are no more ; We have borne their iniquities .
servants rule over us : there is none to deliver us out of their hand .
we get our bread at the peril of our lives , Because of the sword of the wilderness .
our skin is black like an oven , Because of the burning heat of famine .
they ravished the women in Zion , The virgins in the cities of Judah .
princes were hanged up by their hand : the faces of elders were not honored .
the young men bare the mill ; The children stumbled under the wood .
the elders have ceased from the gate , The young men from their music .
the joy of our heart is ceased ; Our dance is turned into mourning .
the crown is fallen from our head : Woe to us ! for we have sinned .
for this our heart is faint ; For these things our eyes are dim ;
for the mountain of Zion , which is desolate : the foxes walk on it .
you , Yahweh , remain forever ; Your throne is from generation to generation .
why do you forget us forever , And forsake us so long time ?
turn us to yourself , Yahweh , and we shall be turned . renew our days as of old .
but you have utterly rejected us ; You are very angry against us .
now it happened in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
in the fifth of the month , which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin 's captivity ,
out of its midst came the likeness of four living creatures . this was their appearance : they had the likeness of a man .
everyone had four faces , and each one of them had four wings .
their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot ; and they sparkled like burnished brass .
they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and the four of them had their faces and their wings thus :
their wings were joined one to another ; they didn 't turn when they went ; each one went straight forward .
such were their faces . their wings were spread out above . two wings of each one touched another , and two covered their bodies .
each one went straight forward : where the spirit was to go , they went ; they didn 't turn when they went .
as for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , like the appearance of torches : the fire went up and down among the living creatures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning .
now as I saw the living creatures , behold , one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures , for each of the four faces of it .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl : and the four of them had one likeness ; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel .
when they went , they went in their four directions : they didn 't turn when they went .
as for their rims , they were high and dreadful ; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around .
when the living creatures went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
wherever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the wheels were lifted up beside them ; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up beside them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse , like the awesome crystal to look on , stretched forth over their heads above .
under the expanse were their wings straight , the one toward the other : each one had two which covered on this side , and every one had two which covered on that side , their bodies .
when they went , I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters , like the voice of the Almighty , a noise of tumult like the noise of an army : when they stood , they let down their wings .
there was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads : when they stood , they let down their wings .
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above .
I saw as it were glowing metal , as the appearance of fire within it all around , from the appearance of his waist and upward ; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and there was brightness around him .
he said to me , Son of man , stand on your feet , and I will speak with you .
the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me , and set me on my feet ; and I heard him who spoke to me .
he said to me , Son of man , I send you to the children of Israel , to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me . they and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day .
the children are impudent and stiff @-@ hearted : I am sending you to them ; and you shall tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh .
they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear , ( for they are a rebellious house ) , yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them .
you shall speak my words to them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear ; for they are most rebellious .
but you , son of man , hear what I tell you ; don 't be rebellious like that rebellious house : open your mouth , and eat that which I give you .
when I looked , behold , a hand was put forth to me ; and , behold , a scroll of a book was therein ;
he spread it before me : and it was written within and without ; and there were written therein lamentations , and mourning , and woe .
he said to me , Son of man , eat that which you find . eat this scroll , and go , speak to the house of Israel .
so I opened my mouth , and he caused me to eat the scroll .
he said to me , Son of man , cause your belly to eat , and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you . then I ate it ; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth .
he said to me , Son of man , go to the house of Israel , and speak my words to them .
for you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language , but to the house of Israel ;
not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . surely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
but the house of Israel will not listen to you ; for they will not listen to me : for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard @-@ hearted .
behold , I have made your face hard against their faces , and your forehead hard against their foreheads .
as an adamant harder than Flint have I made your forehead : Don 't be afraid of them , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they are a rebellious house .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart , and hear with your ears .
go to them of the captivity , to the children of your people , and speak to them , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
then the Spirit lifted me up , and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing , saying , blessed be the glory of Yahweh from his place .
I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another , and the noise of the wheels beside them , even the noise of a great rushing .
so the Spirit lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me .
then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv , that lived by the river Chebar , and to where they lived ; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days .
it happened at the end of seven days , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel : therefore hear the word from my mouth , and give them warning from me .
yet if you warn the wicked , and he doesn 't turn from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but you have delivered your soul .
nevertheless if you warn the righteous man , that the righteous not sin , and he does not sin , he shall surely live , because he took warning ; and you have delivered your soul .
the hand of Yahweh was there on me ; and he said to me , arise , go forth into the plain , and I will there talk with you .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and behold , the glory of Yahweh stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell on my face .
then the Spirit entered into me , and set me on my feet ; and he spoke with me , and said to me , Go , shut yourself inside your house .
but you , son of man , behold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bind you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a reprover ; for they are a rebellious house .
but when I speak with you , I will open your mouth , and you shall tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : he who hears , let him hear ; and he who forbears , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
you also , son of man , take a tile , and lay it before yourself , and portray on it a city , even Jerusalem :
and lay siege against it , and build forts against it , and cast up a mound against it ; set camps also against it , and plant battering rams against it all around .
moreover lie on your left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it ; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it , you shall bear their iniquity .
for I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days , even three hundred ninety days : so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
again , when you have accomplished these , you shall lie on your right side , and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah : forty days , each day for a year , have I appointed it to you .
you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem , with your arm uncovered ; and you shall prophesy against it .
behold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
your food which you shall eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day : from time to time you shall eat it .
you shall drink water by measure , the sixth part of a hin : from time to time you shall drink .
you shall eat it as barley cakes , and you shall bake it in their sight with Dung that comes out of man .
Yahweh said , Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean , among the nations where I will drive them .
then he said to me , behold , I have given you cow 's Dung for man 's Dung , and you shall prepare your bread thereon .
that they may want bread and water , and be dismayed one with another , and pine away in their iniquity .
you , son of man , take a sharp sword ; You shall take it as a Barber 's razor to you , and shall cause it to pass on your head and on your beard : then take balances to weigh , and divide the hair .
you shall take of it a few in number , and bind them in your skirts .
of these again you shall take , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : this is Jerusalem ; I have set her in the midst of the nations , and countries are around her .
she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations , and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ordinances , and as for my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you are turbulent more than the nations that are around you , and have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept my ordinances , neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations .
I will do in you that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all your abominations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter to all the winds .
therefore as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely , because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things , and with all your abominations , therefore will I also diminish you ; neither shall my eye spare , and I also will have no pity .
moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you , in the sight of all that pass by .
when I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine , that are for destruction , which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine on you , and will break your staff of bread ;
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , set your face toward the mountains of Israel , and prophesy to them ,
and say , You mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord Yahweh : thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills , to the watercourses and to the valleys : behold , I , even I , will bring a sword on you , and I will destroy your high places .
your altars shall become desolate , and your incense altars shall be broken ; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols .
I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones around your altars .
the slain shall fall in the midst of you , and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
yet will I leave a remnant , in that you shall have some that escape the sword among the nations , when you shall be scattered through the countries .
they shall know that I am Yahweh : I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them .
he who is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
I will stretch out my hand on them , and make the land desolate and waste , from the wilderness toward Diblah , throughout all their habitations : and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
you , son of man , thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel , An end : the end has come on the four corners of the land .
now is the end on you , and I will send my anger on you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
my eye shall not spare you , neither will I have pity ; but I will bring your ways on you , and your abominations shall be in the midst of you : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : an evil , an only evil ; behold , it comes .
an end has come , the end has come ; it awakes against you ; behold , it comes .
your doom has come to you , inhabitant of the land : the time has come , the day is near , a day of tumult , and not of joyful shouting , on the mountains .
now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you , and accomplish my anger against you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your abominations shall be in the midst of you ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , do strike .
behold , the day , behold , it comes : your doom is gone forth ; the rod has blossomed , pride has budded .
violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness . none of them shall remain , nor of their multitude , nor of their wealth . there shall be nothing of value among them .
the time has come , the day draws near : Don 't let the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn ; for wrath is on all its multitude .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
they have blown the trumpet , and have made all ready ; but none goes to the battle ; for my wrath is on all its multitude .
the sword is outside , and the pestilence and the famine within : he who is in the field shall die with the sword : and he who is in the city , famine and pestilence shall devour him .
but those of those who escape shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them moaning , every one in his iniquity .
all hands shall be feeble , and all knees shall be weak as water .
they shall also clothe themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be on all faces , and baldness on all their heads .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty ; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing .
I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall profane it .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall profane my secret place ; and robbers shall enter into it , and profane it .
make the chain ; for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
therefore I will bring the worst of the nations , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pride of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be profaned .
destruction comes ; and they shall seek peace , and there shall be none .
Mischief shall come on mischief , and rumor shall be on rumor ; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the elders .
it happened in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in my house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell there on me .
then I saw , and behold , a likeness as the appearance of fire ; from the appearance of his waist and downward , fire ; and from his waist and upward , as the appearance of brightness , as it were glowing metal .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the appearance that I saw in the plain .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
he said to me , Son of man , do you see what they do ? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here , that I should go far off from my sanctuary ? but you shall again see yet other great abominations .
he brought me to the door of the court ; and when I looked , behold , a hole in the wall .
then he said to me , Son of man , dig now in the wall : and when I had dug in the wall , behold , a door .
he said to me , Go in , and see the wicked abominations that they do here .
so I went in and saw ; and see , every form of creeping things , and abominable animals , and all the idols of the house of Israel , portrayed around on the wall .
there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel ; and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , every man with his censer in his hand ; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up .
he said also to me , You shall again see yet other great abominations which they do .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh 's house which was toward the north ; and see , there sat the women weeping for Tammuz .
then he said to me , Have you seen this , son of man ? you shall again see yet greater abominations than these .
he brought me into the inner court of Yahweh 's house ; and see , at the door of Yahweh 's temple , between the porch and the altar , were about twenty @-@ five men , with their backs toward Yahweh 's temple , and their faces toward the east ; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east .
therefore will I also deal in wrath ; my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity ; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
then he cried in my ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near , every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clothed in linen , who had the writer 's inkhorn by his side .
Yahweh said to him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in its midst .
to the others he said in my hearing , Go through the city after him , and strike : Don 't let your eye spare , neither have pity ;
he said to them , Defile the house , and fill the courts with the slain . go forth ! they went forth , and struck in the city .
then he said to me , The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of perversion : for they say , Yahweh has forsaken the land , and Yahweh doesn 't see .
as for me also , my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will bring their way on their head .
behold , the man clothed in linen , who had the inkhorn by his side , reported the matter , saying , I have done as you have commanded me .
then I looked , and see , in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
the glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh 's glory .
the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court , as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks .
it came to pass , when he commanded the man clothed in linen , saying , Take fire from between the whirling wheels , from between the cherubim , that he went in , and stood beside a wheel .
the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen , who took it and went out .
there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man 's hand under their wings .
I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the cherubim , one wheel beside one cherub , and another wheel beside another cherub ; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone .
as for their appearance , the four of them had one likeness , like a wheel within a wheel .
when they went , they went in their four directions : they didn 't turn as they went , but to the place where the head looked they followed it ; they didn 't turn as they went .
their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes all around , even the wheels that the four of them had .
as for the wheels , they were called in my hearing , the whirling wheels .
the cherubim mounted up : this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar .
when the cherubim went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the wheels also didn 't turn from beside them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they mounted up , these mounted up with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
the glory of Yahweh went forth from over the threshold of the house , and stood over the cherubim .
the cherubim lifted up their wings , and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth , and the wheels beside them : and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh 's house ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
this is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar ; and I knew that they were cherubim .
every one had four faces , and every one four wings ; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
as for the likeness of their faces , they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar , their appearances and themselves ; they went every one straight forward .
he said to me , Son of man , these are the men who devise iniquity , and who give wicked counsel in this city ;
who say , The time is not near to build houses : this is the caldron , and we are the meat .
therefore prophesy against them , prophesy , son of man .
the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me , and he said to me , Speak , Thus says Yahweh : thus you have said , house of Israel ; for I know the things that come into your mind .
you have multiplied your slain in this city , and you have filled its streets with the slain .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : your slain whom you have laid in its midst , they are the meat , and this is the caldron ; but you shall be brought out of its midst .
you have feared the sword ; and I will bring the sword on you , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will bring you forth out of its midst , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
you shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
this shall not be your caldron , neither shall you be the meat in its midst ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ;
and you shall know that I am Yahweh : for you have not walked in my statutes , neither have you executed my ordinances , but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
therefore say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will gather you from the peoples , and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
they shall come there , and they shall take away all the detestable things of it and all its abominations from there .
I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them a heart of flesh ;
that they may walk in my statutes , and keep my ordinances , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
but as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
then the cherubim lifted up their wings , and the wheels were beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city , and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
the Spirit lifted me up , and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that Yahweh had shown me .
the word of Yahweh also came to me , saying ,
son of man , you dwell in the midst of the rebellious house , who have eyes to see , and don 't see , who have ears to hear , and don 't hear ; for they are a rebellious house .
you shall bring forth your stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for moving ; and you shall go forth yourself at even in their sight , as when men go forth into exile .
dig through the wall in their sight , and carry your stuff out that way .
in their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder , and carry it forth in the dark ; you shall cover your face , so that you don 't see the land : for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel .
I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my stuff by day , as stuff for removing , and in the even I dug through the wall with my hand ; I brought it forth in the dark , and bore it on my shoulder in their sight .
son of man , has not the house of Israel , the rebellious house , said to you , What are you doing ?
say to them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : this burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem , and all the house of Israel among whom they are .
say , I am your sign : like as I have done , so shall it be done to them ; they shall go into exile , into captivity .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my snare ; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall disperse them among the nations , and scatter them through the countries .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , eat your bread with quaking , and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness ;
the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be a desolation ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel , saying , The days are prolonged , and every vision fails ?
tell them therefore , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel ; but tell them , The days are at hand , and the fulfillment of every vision .
for there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel .
again the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he sees is for many day to come , and he prophesies of times that are far off .
therefore tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : none of my words shall be deferred any more , but the word which I shall speak shall be performed , says the Lord Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy , and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart , Hear the word of Yahweh :
thus says the Lord Yahweh , Woe to the foolish prophets , who follow their own spirit , and have seen nothing !
Israel , your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places .
you have not gone up into the gaps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yahweh .
they have seen falsehood and lying divination , who say , Yahweh says ; but Yahweh has not sent them : and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed .
haven 't you seen a false vision , and haven 't you spoken a lying divination , in that you say , Yahweh says ; but I have not spoken ?
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have spoken falsehood , and seen lies , therefore , behold , I am against you , says the Lord Yahweh .
because , even because they have seduced my people , saying , Peace ; and there is no peace ; and when one builds up a wall , behold , they plaster it with whitewash :
tell those who plaster it with whitewash , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and you , great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall tear it .
behold , when the wall has fallen , shall it not be said to you , Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it ?
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will even tear it with a stormy wind in my wrath ; and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger , and great hailstones in wrath to consume it .
so will I break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consumed in its midst : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
you , son of man , set your face against the daughters of your people , who prophesy out of their own heart ; and prophesy against them ,
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , and be saved alive :
therefore you shall no more see false visions , nor practice divination . I will deliver my people out of your hand ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
then came certain of the elders of Israel to me , and sat before me .
son of man , these men have taken their idols into their heart , and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face : should I be inquired of at all by them ?
that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart , because they are all estranged from me through their idols .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : return , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your abominations .
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him an astonishment , for a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
if the prophet is deceived and speak a word , I , Yahweh , have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand on him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
they shall bear their iniquity : the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him who seeks him ;
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , says the Lord Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
if I cause evil animals to pass through the land , and they ravage it , and it be made desolate , so that no man may pass through because of the animals ;
or if I bring a sword on that land , and say , sword , go through the land ; so that I cut off from it man and animal ;
though these three men were in it , as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , they should deliver neither sons nor daughters , but they only should be delivered themselves .
or if I send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my wrath on it in blood , to cut off from it man and animal ;
though Noah , Daniel , and Job , were in it , as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , they should deliver neither son nor daughter ; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
they shall comfort you , when you see their way and their doings ; and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , says the Lord Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , what is the vine tree more than any tree , the vine @-@ branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
shall wood be taken of it to make any work ? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon ?
behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire has devoured both its ends , and its midst is burned : is it profitable for any work ?
behold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less , when the fire has devoured it , and it is burned , shall it yet be meet for any work !
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : as the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
I will set my face against them ; they shall go forth from the fire , but the fire shall devour them ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I set my face against them .
I will make the land desolate , because they have committed a trespass , says the Lord Yahweh .
again the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , cause Jerusalem to know her abominations ;
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem : your birth and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite ; the Amorite was your father , and your mother was a Hittite .
as for your birth , in the day you were born your navel was not cut , neither were you washed in water to cleanse you ; you weren 't salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
no eye pitied you , to do any of these things to you , to have compassion on you ; but you were cast out in the open field , for that your person was abhorred , in the day that you were born .
when I passed by you , and saw you wallowing in your blood , I said to you , Though you are in your blood , live ; yes , I said to you , Though you are in your blood , live .
I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field , and you increased and grew great , and you attained to excellent ornament ; your breasts were fashioned , and your hair was grown ; yet you were naked and bare .
then washed I you with water ; yes , I thoroughly washed away your blood from you , and I anointed you with oil .
I clothed you also with embroidered work , and shod you with sealskin , and I dressed you about with fine linen , and covered you with silk .
I decked you with ornaments , and I put bracelets on your hands , and a chain on your neck .
I put a ring on your nose , and earrings in your ears , and a beautiful crown on your head .
thus you were decked with gold and silver ; and your clothing was of fine linen , and silk , and embroidered work ; you ate fine flour , and honey , and oil ; and you were exceeding beautiful , and you prospered to royal estate .
your renown went forth among the nations for your beauty ; for it was perfect , through my majesty which I had put on you , says the Lord Yahweh .
but you trusted in your beauty , and played the prostitute because of your renown , and poured out your prostitution on everyone who passed by ; his it was .
you took of your garments , and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors , and played the prostitute on them : [ the like things ] shall not come , neither shall it be [ so ] .
you also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yourself images of men , and played the prostitute with them ;
and you took your embroidered garments , and covered them , and set my oil and my incense before them .
my bread also which I gave you , fine flour , and oil , and honey , with which I fed you , you even set it before them for a pleasant aroma ; and [ thus ] it was , says the Lord Yahweh .
moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters , whom you have borne to me , and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured . was your prostitution a small matter ,
that you have slain my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through [ the fire ] to them ?
in all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth , when you were naked and bare , and were wallowing in your blood .
it has happened after all your wickedness , ( woe , woe to you ! says the Lord Yahweh ) ,
that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place , and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street .
you have built your lofty place at the head of every way , and have made your beauty an abomination , and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by , and multiplied your prostitution .
you have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians , your neighbors , great of flesh ; and have multiplied your prostitution , to provoke me to anger .
you have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians , because you were insatiable ; yes , you have played the prostitute with them , and yet you weren 't satisfied .
you have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants , to Chaldea ; and yet you weren 't satisfied with this .
how weak is your heart , says the Lord Yahweh , since you do all these things , the work of an impudent prostitute ;
in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way , and make your lofty place in every street , and have not been as a prostitute , in that you scorn pay .
a wife who commits adultery ! who takes strangers instead of her husband !
they give gifts to all prostitutes ; but you give your gifts to all your lovers , and bribe them , that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution .
you are different from [ other ] women in your prostitution , in that no one follows you to play the prostitute ; and whereas you give hire , and no hire is given to you , therefore you are different .
therefore , prostitute , hear the word of Yahweh :
thus says the Lord Yahweh , Because your filthiness was poured out , and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers ; and because of all the idols of your abominations , and for the blood of your children , that you gave to them ;
I will judge you , as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy .
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your vaulted place , and break down your lofty places ; and they shall strip you of your clothes , and take your beautiful jewels ; and they shall leave you naked and bare .
they shall also bring up a company against you , and they shall stone you with stones , and thrust you through with their swords .
they shall burn your houses with fire , and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute , and you shall also give no hire any more .
so will I cause my wrath toward you to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from you , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
behold , everyone who uses Proverbs shall use [ this ] proverb against you , saying , As is the mother , so is her daughter .
you are the daughter of your mother , who loathes her husband and her children ; and you are the sister of your sisters , who loathed their husbands and their children : your mother was a Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
your elder sister is Samaria , who dwells at your left hand , she and her daughters ; and your younger sister , who dwells at your right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
yet have you not walked in their ways , nor done after their abominations ; but , as [ if that were ] a very little [ thing ] , you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , Sodom your sister has not done , she nor her daughters , as you have done , you and your daughters .
behold , this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom : pride , fullness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
they were haughty , and committed abomination before me : therefore I took them away as I saw [ good ] .
neither has Samaria committed half of your sins ; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they , and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done .
I will turn again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , and the captivity of your captives in their midst ;
that you may bear your own shame , and may be ashamed because of all that you have done , in that you are a comfort to them .
your sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate ; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate ; and you and your daughters shall return to your former estate .
you have borne your lewdness and your abominations , says Yahweh .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will also deal with you as you have done , who have despised the oath in breaking the Covenant .
nevertheless I will remember my Covenant with you in the days of your youth , and I will establish to you an everlasting Covenant .
then you shall remember your ways , and be ashamed , when you shall receive your sisters , your elder [ sisters ] and your younger ; and I will give them to you for daughters , but not by your Covenant .
I will establish my Covenant with you ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh ;
that you may remember , and be confounded , and never open your mouth any more , because of your shame , when I have forgiven you all that you have done , says the Lord Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , put forth a riddle , and speak a parable to the house of Israel ;
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : a great eagle with great wings and long feathers , full of feathers , which had various colors , came to Lebanon , and took the top of the cedar :
he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it , and carried it to a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of merchants .
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful soil ; he placed it beside many waters ; he set it as a willow tree .
it was planted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
yes , behold , being planted , shall it prosper ? shall it not utterly wither , when the east wind touches it ? it shall wither in the beds where it grew .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
and he took of the seed royal , and made a Covenant with him ; he also brought him under an oath , and took away the mighty of the land ;
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping his Covenant it might stand .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose Covenant he broke , even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
for he has despised the oath by breaking the Covenant ; and behold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : as I live , surely my oath that he has despised , and my Covenant that he has broken , I will even bring it on his own head .
I will spread my net on him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me .
all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword , and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it ; and it shall bring forth boughs , and bear fruit , and be a goodly cedar : and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing ; in the shade of its branches shall they dwell .
the word of Yahweh came to me again , saying ,
what do you mean , that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , you shall not have [ occasion ] any more to use this proverb in Israel .
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul who sins , he shall die .
but if a man is just , and does that which is lawful and right ,
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has defiled his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her impurity ,
and has not wronged any , but has restored to the debtor his pledge , has taken nothing by robbery , has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
has walked in my statutes , and has kept my ordinances , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , says the Lord Yahweh .
if he fathers a son who is a robber , a shedder of blood , and who does any one of these things ,
and who does not any of those [ duties ] , but even has eaten on the mountains , and defiled his neighbor 's wife ,
has wronged the poor and needy , has taken by robbery , has not restored the pledge , and has lifted up his eyes to the idols , has committed abomination ,
has given forth on interest , and has taken increase ; shall he then live ? he shall not live : he has done all these abominations ; he shall surely die ; his blood shall be on him .
now , behold , if he fathers a son , who sees all his father 's sins , which he has done , and fears , and does not such like ;
who has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , has not defiled his neighbor 's wife ,
neither has wronged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ordinances , has walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
as for his father , because he cruelly oppressed , robbed his brother , and did that which is not good among his people , behold , he shall die in his iniquity .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
none of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him : in his righteousness that he has done he shall live .
have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked ? says the Lord Yahweh ; and not rather that he should return from his way , and live ?
yet you say , The way of the Lord is not equal . hear now , house of Israel : is my way not equal ? Aren 't your ways unequal ?
when the righteous man turns away from his righteousness , and commits iniquity , and dies therein ; in his iniquity that he has done shall he die .
again , when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed , and does that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he considers , and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
yet the house of Israel says , " The way of the Lord is not fair . " house of Israel , aren 't my ways fair ? Aren 't your ways unfair ?
cast away from you all your transgressions , in which you have transgressed ; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit : for why will you die , house of Israel ?
for I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies , says the Lord Yahweh : therefore turn yourselves , and live .
moreover , take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel ,
and say , What was your mother ? a lioness : she couched among lions , in the midst of the young lions she nourished her cubs .
she brought up one of her cubs : he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit ; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt .
now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her cubs , and made him a young lion .
he went up and down among the lions ; he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
he knew their palaces , and laid waste their cities ; and the land was desolate , and its fullness , because of the noise of his roaring .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
they put him in a cage with hooks , and brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into strongholds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
your mother was like a vine , in your blood , planted by the waters : it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
it had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule , and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs , and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches .
but it was plucked up in fury , it was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up its fruit : its strong rods were broken off and withered ; the fire consumed them .
now it is planted in the wilderness , in a dry and thirsty land .
fire is gone out of the rods of its branches , it has devoured its fruit , so that there is in it no strong rod to be a scepter to rule . this is a lamentation , and shall be for a lamentation .
it happened in the seventh year , in the fifth [ month ] , the tenth [ day ] of the month , that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Yahweh , and sat before me .
son of man , speak to the elders of Israel , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : is it to inquire of me that you have come ? as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , I will not be inquired of by you .
will you judge them , son of man , will you judge them ? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers ;
and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the day when I chose Israel , and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob , and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt , when I swore to them , saying , I am Yahweh your God ;
in that day I swore to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands .
I said to them , cast away every man the abominations of his eyes , and don 't defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt ; I am Yahweh your God .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
so I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
I gave them my statutes , and showed them my ordinances , which if a man does , he shall live in them .
moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies them .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
because they rejected my ordinances , and didn 't walk in my statutes , and profaned my Sabbaths : for their heart went after their idols .
nevertheless my eye spared them , and I didn 't destroy them , neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness .
I said to their children in the wilderness , Don 't walk in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their ordinances , nor defile yourselves with their idols .
I am Yahweh your God : walk in my statutes , and keep my ordinances , and do them ;
and make my Sabbaths holy ; and they shall be a sign between me and you , that you may know that I am Yahweh your God .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
moreover I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ;
because they had not executed my ordinances , but had rejected my statutes , and had profaned my Sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good , and ordinances in which they should not live ;
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
then I said to them , What does the high place where you go mean ? so its name is called Bamah to this day .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers ? and do you play the prostitute after their abominations ?
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with wrath poured out , will I be king over you :
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with wrath poured out ;
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face .
like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I enter into judgment with you , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will cause you to pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant ;
and I will purge out from among you the rebels , and those who disobey against me ; I will bring them forth out of the land where they live , but they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
for in my holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them , serve me in the land : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offerings , and the first fruits of your offerings , with all your holy things .
as a pleasant aroma will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered ; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country which I swore to give to your fathers .
there you shall remember your ways , and all your doings , in which you have polluted yourselves ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your evil ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , set your face toward the south , and drop [ your word ] toward the south , and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South ;
all flesh shall see that I , Yahweh , have kindled it ; it shall not be quenched .
then I said , Ah Lord Yahweh ! they say of me , Isn 't he a speaker of parables ?
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , set your face toward Jerusalem , and drop [ your word ] toward the sanctuaries , and prophesy against the land of Israel ;
and tell the land of Israel , Thus says Yahweh : behold , I am against you , and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath , and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked .
seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
and all flesh shall know that I , Yahweh , have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath ; it shall not return any more .
sigh therefore , you son of man ; with the breaking of your thighs and with bitterness you will sigh before their eyes .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus says Yahweh : say , A sword , a sword , it is sharpened , and also furbished ;
it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter ; it is furbished that it may be as lightning : shall we then make mirth ? the rod of my son , it condemns every tree .
it is given to be furbished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpened , yes , it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
cry and wail , son of man ; for it is on my people , it is on all the princes of Israel : they are delivered over to the sword with my people ; strike therefore on your thigh .
for there is a trial ; and what if even the rod that condemns shall be no more ? says the Lord Yahweh .
I have set the threatening sword against all their gates , that their heart may melt , and their stumblings be multiplied : ah ! it is made as lightning , it is pointed for slaughter .
gather yourselves together , go to the right , set yourselves in array , go to the left , wherever your face is set .
I will also strike my hands together , and I will cause my wrath to rest : I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
the word of Yahweh came to me again , saying ,
also , you son of man , appoint two ways , that the sword of the king of Babylon may come ; they both shall come forth out of one land : and mark out a place , mark it out at the head of the way to the city .
you shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified .
it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight , who have sworn oaths to them ; but he brings iniquity to memory , that they may be taken .
you , deadly wounded wicked one , the prince of Israel , whose day has come , in the time of the iniquity of the end ,
thus says the Lord Yahweh : remove the turban , and take off the crown ; this [ shall be ] no more the same ; exalt that which is low , and abase that which is high .
I will overturn , overturn , overturn it : this also shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it [ him ] .
cause it to return into its sheath . in the place where you were created , in the land of your birth , will I judge you .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men , skillful to destroy .
you shall be for fuel to the fire ; your blood shall be in the midst of the land ; you shall be remembered no more : for I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
you , son of man , will you judge , will you judge the bloody city ? then cause her to know all her abominations .
you shall say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : a city that sheds blood in the midst of her , that her time may come , and that makes idols against herself to defile her !
those who are near , and those who are far from you , shall mock you , you infamous one [ and ] full of tumult .
behold , the princes of Israel , everyone according to his power , have been in you to shed blood .
in you have they set light by father and mother ; in the midst of you have they dealt by oppression with the foreigner ; in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow .
you have despised my holy things , and have profaned my Sabbaths .
Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood ; and in you they have eaten on the mountains : in the midst of you they have committed lewdness .
in you have they uncovered their fathers ' nakedness ; in you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity .
one has committed abomination with his neighbor 's wife ; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter @-@ in @-@ law ; and another in you has humbled his sister , his father 's daughter .
in you have they taken bribes to shed blood ; you have taken interest and increase , and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by oppression , and have forgotten me , says the Lord Yahweh .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
can your heart endure , or can your hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with you ? I , Yahweh , have spoken it , and will do it .
I will scatter you among the nations , and disperse you through the countries ; and I will consume your filthiness out of you .
you shall be profaned in yourself , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , the house of Israel has become dross to me : all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are the dross of silver .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have all become dross , therefore , behold , I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem .
yes , I will gather you , and blow on you with the fire of my wrath , and you shall be melted in its midst .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so you will be melted in its midst ; and you will know that I , Yahweh , have poured out my wrath on you .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , tell her , You are a land that is not cleansed , nor rained on in the day of indignation .
there is a conspiracy of her prophets in its midst , like a roaring lion ravening the prey : they have devoured souls ; they take treasure and precious things ; they have made her widows many in its midst .
her princes in its midst are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , [ and ] to destroy souls , that they may get dishonest gain .
her prophets have plastered for them with whitewash , seeing false visions , and divining lies to them , saying , Thus says the Lord Yahweh , when Yahweh has not spoken .
the people of the land have used oppression , and exercised robbery ; yes , they have troubled the poor and needy , and have oppressed the foreigner wrongfully .
therefore have I poured out my indignation on them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came again to me , saying ,
son of man , there were two women , the daughters of one mother :
and they played the prostitute in Egypt ; they played the prostitute in their youth ; there were their breasts pressed , and there was handled the bosom of their virginity .
their names were Oholah the elder , and Oholibah her sister : and they became mine , and they bore sons and daughters . as for their names , Samaria is Oholah , and Jerusalem Oholibah .
Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine ; and she doted on her lovers , on the Assyrians [ her ] neighbors ,
she bestowed her prostitution on them , the choicest men of Assyria all of them ; and on whoever she doted , with all their idols she defiled herself .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bosom of her virginity ; and they poured out their prostitution on her .
therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the Assyrians , on whom she doted .
these uncovered her nakedness ; they took her sons and her daughters ; and her they killed with the sword : and she became a byword among women ; for they executed judgments on her .
her sister Oholibah saw this , yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she , and in her prostitution which were more than the prostitution of her sister .
she doted on the Assyrians , governors and rulers , [ her ] neighbors , clothed most gorgeously , horsemen riding on horses , all of them desirable young men .
I saw that she was defiled ; they both took one way .
as soon as she saw them she doted on them , and sent messengers to them into Chaldea .
the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their prostitution , and she was polluted with them , and her soul was alienated from them .
so she uncovered her prostitution , and uncovered her nakedness : then my soul was alienated from her , like as my soul was alienated from her sister .
yet she multiplied her prostitution , remembering the days of her youth , in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt .
she doted on their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth , in the handling of your bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of your youth .
therefore , Oholibah , thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will raise up your lovers against you , from whom your soul is alienated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans , Pekod and Shoa and Koa , [ and ] all the Assyrians with them ; desirable young men , governors and rulers all of them , princes and men of renown , all of them riding on horses .
they shall also strip you of your clothes , and take away your beautiful jewels .
thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate , into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated ;
you have walked in the way of your sister ; therefore will I give her cup into your hand .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : you will drink of your sister 's cup , which is deep and large ; you will be ridiculed and held in derision ; it contains much .
you shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of your sister Samaria .
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have forgotten me , and cast me behind your back , therefore you also bear your lewdness and your prostitution .
Yahweh said moreover to me : son of man , will you judge Oholah and Oholibah ? then declare to them their abominations .
for they have committed adultery , and blood is in their hands ; and with their idols have they committed adultery ; and they have also caused their sons , whom they bore to me , to pass through [ the fire ] to them to be devoured .
furthermore you have sent for men who come from far , to whom a messenger was sent , and behold , they came ; for whom you did wash yourself , paint your eyes , and decorate yourself with ornaments ,
and sit on a stately bed , with a table prepared before it , whereupon you set my incense and my oil .
then I said of her who was old in adulteries , Now will they play the prostitute with her , and she [ with them ] .
they went in to her , as they go in to a prostitute : so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah , the lewd women .
Righteous men , they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses , and with the judgment of women who shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will bring up a company against them , and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall kill their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land , that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness .
they shall recompense your lewdness on you , and you shall bear the sins of your idols ; and you shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , write the name of the day , [ even ] of this same day : the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day .
utter a parable to the rebellious house , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh , Set on the caldron , set it on , and also pour water into it :
gather its pieces into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
take the choice of the flock , and also a pile [ of wood ] for the bones under [ the caldron ] ; make it boil well ; yes , let its bones be boiled in its midst .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : Woe to the bloody city , to the caldron whose rust is therein , and whose rust is not gone out of it ! take out of it piece after piece ; No lot is fallen on it .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it on the bare rock ; she didn 't pour it on the ground , to cover it with dust .
that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , I have set her blood on the bare rock , that it should not be covered .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : Woe to the bloody city ! I also will make the pile great .
heap on the wood , make the fire hot , boil well the flesh , and make thick the broth , and let the bones be burned .
then set it empty on its coals , that it may be hot , and its brass may burn , and that its filthiness may be molten in it , that its rust may be consumed .
she has wearied [ herself ] with toil ; yet her great rust doesn 't go forth out of her ; her rust doesn 't [ go forth ] by fire .
in your filthiness is lewdness : because I have cleansed you and you weren 't cleansed , you shall not be cleansed from your filthiness any more , until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest .
also the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , behold , I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke : yet you shall neither mourn nor weep , neither shall your tears run down .
sigh , but not aloud , make no mourning for the dead ; bind your headdress on you , and put your shoes on your feet , and don 't cover your lips , and don 't eat men 's bread .
so I spoke to the people in the morning ; and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
the people said to me , won 't you tell us what these things are to us , that you do so ?
then I said to them , The word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
you shall do as I have done : you shall not cover your lips , nor eat the bread of men .
your tires shall be on your heads , and your shoes on your feet : you shall not mourn nor weep ; but you shall pine away in your iniquities , and moan one toward another .
thus Ezekiel shall be a sign to you ; according to all that he has done , you will do . when this comes , then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh .
in that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped , and you shall speak , and be no more mute : so you will be a sign to them ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , set your face toward the children of Ammon , and prophesy against them :
therefore , behold , I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their encampments in you , and make their dwellings in you ; they shall eat your fruit , and they shall drink your milk .
I will make Rabbah a stable for camels , and the children of Ammon a resting place for flocks : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have clapped your hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced with all the despite of your soul against the land of Israel ;
thus says the Lord Yahweh : because Moab and Seir say , behold , the house of Judah is like all the nations ;
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth Jeshimoth , Baal Meon , and Kiriathaim ,
to the children of the east , [ to go ] against the children of Ammon ; and I will give them for a possession , that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations .
and I will execute judgments on Moab ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and has greatly offended , and revenged himself on them ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , I will stretch out my hand on Edom , and will cut off man and animal from it ; and I will make it desolate from Teman ; even to Dedan shall they fall by the sword .
I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel ; and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath ; and they shall know my vengeance , says the Lord Yahweh .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : because the Philistines have dealt by revenge , and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , behold , I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines , and I will cut off the Cherethites , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast .
I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall lay my vengeance on them .
it happened in the eleventh year , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , behold , I am against you , Tyre , and will cause many nations to come up against you , as the sea causes its waves to come up .
they shall destroy the walls of Tyre , and break down her towers : I will also scrape her dust from her , and make her a bare rock .
she shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh ; and she shall become a spoil to the nations .
her daughters who are in the field shall be slain with the sword : and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , king of kings , from the north , with horses , and with chariots , and with horsemen , and a company , and many people .
he shall kill your daughters in the field with the sword ; and he shall make forts against you , and cast up a mound against you , and raise up the buckler against you .
he shall set his battering engines against your walls , and with his axes he shall break down your towers .
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the sword ; and the pillars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
they shall make a spoil of your riches , and make a prey of your merchandise ; and they shall break down your walls , and destroy your pleasant houses ; and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the waters .
I will cause the noise of your songs to cease ; and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard .
I will make you a bare rock ; you shall be a place for the spreading of nets ; you shall be built no more : for I Yahweh have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
thus says the Lord Yahweh to Tyre : shall not the islands shake at the sound of your fall , when the wounded groan , when the slaughter is made in the midst of you ?
then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones , and lay aside their robes , and strip off their embroidered garments : they shall clothe themselves with trembling ; they shall sit on the ground , and shall tremble every moment , and be astonished at you .
now shall the islands tremble in the day of your fall ; yes , the islands that are in the sea shall be dismayed at your departure .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : when I shall make you a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep on you , and the great waters shall cover you ;
the word of Yahweh came again to me , saying ,
you , son of man , take up a lamentation over Tyre ;
and tell Tyre , you who dwell at the entry of the sea , who are the merchant of the peoples to many islands , thus says the Lord Yahweh : you , Tyre , have said , I am perfect in beauty .
your borders are in the heart of the seas ; your builders have perfected your beauty .
they have made all your planks of fir trees from Senir ; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you .
of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars ; they have made your benches of Ivory inlaid in boxwood , from the islands of Kittim .
of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail , that it might be to you for a banner ; blue and purple from the islands of Elishah was your awning .
the inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers : your wise men , Tyre , were in you , they were your pilots .
the old men of Gebal and the wise men of it were in you your repairers of ship seams : all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to deal in your merchandise .
Persia and Lud and Put were in your army , your men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in you ; they set forth your comeliness .
the men of Arvad with your army were on your walls all around , and valorous men were in your towers ; they hanged their shields on your walls all around ; they have perfected your beauty .
Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches ; with silver , iron , tin , and lead , they traded for your wares .
Javan , Tubal , and Meshech , they were your traffickers ; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for your merchandise .
they of the house of Togarmah traded for your wares with horses and war horses and mules .
the men of Dedan were your traffickers ; many islands were the market of your hand : they brought you in exchange horns of Ivory and ebony .
Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of your handiworks : they traded for your wares with emeralds , purple , and embroidered work , and fine linen , and coral , and rubies .
Judah , and the land of Israel , they were your traffickers : they traded for your merchandise wheat of Minnith , and confections , and honey , and oil , and balm .
Dedan was your trafficker in precious cloths for riding .
Arabia , and all the princes of Kedar , they were the merchants of your hand ; in lambs , and rams , and goats , in these were they your merchants .
the traffickers of Sheba and Raamah , they were your traffickers ; they traded for your wares with the chief of all spices , and with all precious stones , and gold .
Haran and Canneh and Eden , the traffickers of Sheba , Asshur [ and ] Chilmad , were your traffickers .
these were your traffickers in choice wares , in wrappings of blue and embroidered work , and in chests of rich clothing , bound with cords and made of cedar , among your merchandise .
the ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise : and you were replenished , and made very glorious in the heart of the seas .
your rowers have brought you into great waters : the east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas .
at the sound of the cry of your pilots the suburbs shall shake .
all who handled the oar , the mariners , [ and ] all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
and shall cause their voice to be heard over you , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust on their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
and they shall make themselves bald for you , and clothe them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for you in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning .
in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you , and lament over you , [ saying ] , Who is there like Tyre , like her who is brought to silence in the midst of the sea ?
when your wares went forth out of the seas , you filled many peoples ; you enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise .
in the time that you were broken by the seas in the depths of the waters , your merchandise and all your company fell in your midst .
all the inhabitants of the islands are astonished at you , and their kings are horribly afraid ; they are troubled in their face .
the merchants among the peoples hiss at you ; you are become a terror , and you shall nevermore have any being .
the word of Yahweh came again to me , saying ,
behold , you are wiser than Daniel ; there is no secret that is hidden from you ;
by your wisdom and by your understanding you have gotten yourself riches , and have gotten gold and silver into your treasures ;
by your great wisdom [ and ] by your traffic you have increased your riches , and your heart is lifted up because of your riches--
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have set your heart as the heart of God ,
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall defile your brightness .
they shall bring you down to the pit ; and you shall die the death of those who are slain , in the heart of the seas .
will you yet say before him who kills you , I am God ? but you are man , and not God , in the hand of him who wounds you .
you shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers : for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre , and tell him , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : you seal up the sum , full of wisdom , and perfect in beauty .
you were the anointed cherub who covers : and I set you , [ so that ] you were on the holy mountain of God ; you have walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
you were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created , until unrighteousness was found in you .
your heart was lifted up because of your beauty ; you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness : I have cast you to the ground ; I have laid you before kings , that they may see you .
all those who know you among the peoples shall be astonished at you : you have become a terror , and you shall nevermore have any being .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , set your face toward Sidon , and prophesy against it ,
for I will send pestilence into her , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her , with the sword on her on every side ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
there shall be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel , nor a hurting Thorn of any that are around them , that scorned them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : when I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered , and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations , then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob .
they shall dwell securely therein ; yes , they shall build houses , and plant vineyards , and shall dwell securely , when I have executed judgments on all those who do them despite all around them ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh their God .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twelfth day of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
" son of man , set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and prophesy against him and against all Egypt .
I will put hooks in your jaws , and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales ; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers , with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales .
I 'll cast you forth into the wilderness , you and all the fish of your rivers . you 'll fall on the open field . you won 't be brought together , nor gathered . I have given you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds of the sky .
all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh , because they have been a staff of Reed to the house of Israel .
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and tore all their shoulders ; and when they leaned on you , you broke , and paralyzed all of their thighs . "
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : " behold , I will bring a sword on you , and will cut off man and animal from you .
the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh . because he has said , ' The river is mine , and I have made it ; '
therefore , behold , I am against you , and against your rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation , from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia .
no foot of man shall pass through it , nor foot of animal shall pass through it , neither shall it be inhabited forty years .
I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate ; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years ; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries . "
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : " at the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered ;
and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the base of the kingdoms ; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations : and I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall carry off her multitude , and take her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served , because they worked for me , says the Lord Yahweh .
in that day will I cause a Horn to bud forth to the house of Israel , and I will give you the opening of the mouth in their midst ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came again to me , saying ,
son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : Wail , Alas for the day !
for the day is near , even the day of Yahweh is near ; it shall be a day of clouds , a time of the nations .
a sword shall come on Egypt , and anguish shall be in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt ; and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
Ethiopia , and Put , and Lud , and all the mixed people , and Cub , and the children of the land that is allied with them , shall fall with them by the sword .
thus says Yahweh : they also who uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword , says the Lord Yahweh .
they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate ; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and all her helpers are destroyed .
in that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid ; and there shall be anguish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , behold , it comes .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease , by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought in to destroy the land ; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
I will make the rivers dry , and will sell the land into the hand of evil men ; and I will make the land desolate , and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers : I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will also destroy the idols , and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis ; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
I will make Pathros desolate , and will set a fire in Zoan , and will execute judgments on No .
I will pour my wrath on sin , the stronghold of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multitude of No .
I will set a fire in Egypt : sin shall be in great anguish , and No shall be broken up ; and Memphis [ shall have ] adversaries in the daytime .
the young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword ; and these [ cities ] shall go into captivity .
at Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself , when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt , and the pride of her power shall cease in her : as for her , a cloud shall cover her , and her daughters shall go into captivity .
thus will I execute judgments on Egypt ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
it happened in the eleventh year , in the first [ month ] , in the seventh [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and behold , it has not been bound up , to apply [ healing ] medicines , to put a bandage to bind it , that it be strong to hold the sword .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong [ arm ] , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but I will break the arms of Pharaoh , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
son of man , tell Pharaoh king of Egypt , and to his multitude : whom are you like in your greatness ?
behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches , and with a forest @-@ like shade , and of high stature ; and its top was among the thick boughs .
the waters nourished it , the deep made it to grow : its rivers ran all around its plantation ; and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field .
therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field ; and its boughs were multiplied , and its branches became long by reason of many waters , when it shot [ them ] forth .
all the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
thus was it beautiful in its greatness , in the length of its branches ; for its root was by many waters .
I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches , so that all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , envied it .
therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh : because you are exalted in stature , and he has set his top among the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ;
I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations ; he shall surely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his wickedness .
Strangers , the terrible of the nations , have cut him off , and have left him : on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen , and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land ; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow , and have left him .
on his ruin all the birds of the sky shall dwell , and all the animals of the field shall be on his branches ;
they also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the midst of the nations .
it happened in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples ; and they shall bring you up in my net .
I will leave you on the land , I will cast you forth on the open field , and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you , and I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you .
I will lay your flesh on the mountains , and fill the valleys with your height .
I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim , even to the mountains ; and the watercourses shall be full of you .
when I shall extinguish you , I will cover the heavens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give its light .
all the bright lights of the sky will I make dark over you , and set darkness on your land , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples , when I shall bring your destruction among the nations , into the countries which you have not known .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : the sword of the king of Babylon shall come on you .
by the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall ; the terrible of the nations are they all : and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt , and all its multitude shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of animals trouble them .
then will I make their waters clear , and cause their rivers to run like oil , says the Lord Yahweh .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste , a land destitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who dwell therein , then shall they know that I am Yahweh .
this is the lamentation with which they shall lament ; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith ; over Egypt , and over all her multitude , shall they lament therewith , says the Lord Yahweh .
it happened also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , to the lower parts of the earth , with those who go down into the pit .
whom do you pass in beauty ? go down , and be laid with the uncircumcised .
they shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword : she is delivered to the sword ; draw her away and all her multitudes .
the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those who help him : they are gone down , they lie still , even the uncircumcised , slain by the sword .
Asshur is there and all her company ; her graves are all around her ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword ;
whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit , and her company is around her grave ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Meshech , Tubal , and all their multitude ; their graves are around them ; all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword ; for they caused their terror in the land of the living .
but you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised , and shall lie with those who are slain by the sword .
there is Edom , her kings and all her princes , who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with those who go down to the pit .
Pharaoh shall see them , and shall be comforted over all his multitude , even Pharaoh and all his army , slain by the sword , says the Lord Yahweh .
for I have put his terror in the land of the living ; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised , with those who are slain by the sword , even Pharaoh and all his multitude , says the Lord Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , speak to the children of your people , and tell them , When I bring the sword on a land , and the people of the land take a man from among them , and set him for their watchman ;
if , when he sees the sword come on the land , he blow the trumpet , and warn the people ;
then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet , and doesn 't take warning , if the sword come , and take him away , his blood shall be on his own head .
he heard the sound of the trumpet , and didn 't take warning ; his blood shall be on him ; whereas if he had taken warning , he would have delivered his soul .
so you , son of man , I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel ; therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
when I tell the wicked , O wicked man , you shall surely die , and you don 't speak to warn the wicked from his way ; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity , but his blood will I require at your hand .
nevertheless , if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it , and he doesn 't turn from his way ; he shall die in his iniquity , but you have delivered your soul .
when I tell the righteous , that he shall surely live ; if he trust to his righteousness , and commit iniquity , none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered ; but in his iniquity that he has committed , therein shall he die .
again , when I say to the wicked , You shall surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
if the wicked restore the pledge , give again that which he had taken by robbery , walk in the statutes of life , committing no iniquity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
none of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him : he has done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
yet the children of your people say , The way of the Lord is not equal : but as for them , their way is not equal .
when the righteous turns from his righteousness , and commits iniquity , he shall even die therein .
when the wicked turns from his wickedness , and does that which is lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
yet you say , The way of the Lord is not equal . house of Israel , I will judge every one of you after his ways .
it happened in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth [ month ] , in the fifth [ day ] of the month , that one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me , saying , The city has been struck .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , they who inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak , saying , Abraham was one , and he inherited the land : but we are many ; the land is given us for inheritance .
therefore tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : you eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes to your idols , and shed blood : and shall you possess the land ?
you stand on your sword , you work abomination , and every one of you defiles his neighbor 's wife : and shall you possess the land ?
I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment ; and the pride of her power shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , so that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am Yahweh , when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment , because of all their abominations which they have committed .
behold , you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear your words , but they don 't do them .
when this comes to pass , ( behold , it comes ) , then shall they know that a prophet has been among them .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel , prophesy , and tell them , even to the shepherds , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves ! Shouldn 't the shepherds feed the sheep ?
you eat the fat , and you clothe yourself with the wool , you kill the fatlings ; but you don 't feed the sheep .
you haven 't strengthened the diseased , neither have you healed that which was sick , neither have you bound up that which was broken , neither have you brought back that which was driven away , neither have you sought that which was lost ; but with force and with rigor you have ruled over them .
they were scattered , because there was no shepherd ; and they became food to all the animals of the field , and were scattered .
my sheep wandered through all the mountains , and on every high hill : yes , my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth ; and there was none who searched or sought .
therefore , you shepherds , hear the word of Yahweh :
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely because my sheep became a prey , and my sheep became food to all the animals of the field , because there was no shepherd , neither did my shepherds search for my sheep , but the shepherds fed themselves , and didn 't feed my sheep ;
therefore , you shepherds , hear the word of Yahweh :
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I myself , even I , will search for my sheep , and will seek them out .
I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land ; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel , by the watercourses , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them with good pasture ; and on the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie down in a good fold ; and on fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel .
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep , and I will cause them to lie down , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will seek that which was lost , and will bring back that which was driven away , and will bind up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was sick : but the fat and the strong I will destroy ; I will feed them in justice .
as for you , O my flock , thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I judge between sheep and sheep , the rams and the male goats .
does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture , but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture ? and to have drunk of the clear waters , but you must foul the residue with your feet ?
as for my sheep , they eat that which you have trodden with your feet , and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh to them : behold , I , even I , will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep .
because you thrust with side and with shoulder , and push all the diseased with your horns , until you have scattered them abroad ;
therefore will I save my flock , and they shall no more be a prey ; and I will judge between sheep and sheep .
I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
I , Yahweh , will be their God , and my servant David prince among them ; I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
I will make with them a Covenant of peace , and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land ; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
they shall no more be a prey to the nations , neither shall the animals of the earth devour them ; but they shall dwell securely , and none shall make them afraid .
I will raise up to them a plantation for renown , and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land , neither bear the shame of the nations any more .
they shall know that I , Yahweh , their God am with them , and that they , the house of Israel , are my people , says the Lord Yahweh .
you my sheep , the sheep of my pasture , are men , and I am your God , says the Lord Yahweh .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , set your face against Mount Seir , and prophesy against it ,
and tell it , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against you , Mount Seir , and I will stretch out my hand against you , and I will make you a desolation and an astonishment .
I will lay your cities waste , and you shall be desolate ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because you have had a perpetual enmity , and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time of the iniquity of the end ;
therefore , as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , I will prepare you for blood , and blood shall pursue you : since you have not hated blood , therefore blood shall pursue you .
thus will I make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation ; and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns .
I will fill its mountains with its slain : in your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses shall they fall who are slain with the sword .
I will make you a perpetual desolation , and your cities shall not be inhabited ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because you have said , These two nations and these two countries shall be mine , and we will possess it ; whereas Yahweh was there :
you shall know that I , Yahweh , have heard all your insults which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they have been given us to devour .
you have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard it .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : when the whole earth rejoices , I will make you desolate .
you , son of man , prophesy to the mountains of Israel , and say , You mountains of Israel , hear the word of Yahweh .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : because the enemy has said against you , Aha ! and , The ancient high places are ours in possession ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : I have sworn , [ saying ] , surely the nations that are around you , they shall bear their shame .
but you , mountains of Israel , you shall shoot forth your branches , and yield your fruit to my people Israel ; for they are at hand to come .
for , behold , I am for you , and I will turn into you , and you shall be tilled and sown ;
and I will multiply men on you , all the house of Israel , even all of it ; and the cities shall be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built ;
yes , I will cause men to walk on you , even my people Israel ; and they shall possess you , and you shall be their inheritance , and you shall no more henceforth bereave them of children .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : because they say to you , You are a devourer of men , and have been a bereaver of your nation ;
therefore you shall devour men no more , neither bereave your nation any more , says the Lord Yahweh ;
neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations , neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more , says the Lord Yahweh .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , they defiled it by their way and by their doings : their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity .
therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land , and because they had defiled it with their idols ;
and I scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
when they came to the nations , where they went , they profaned my holy name ; in that men said of them , These are the people of Yahweh , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had respect for my holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations , where they went .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I don 't do [ this ] for your sake , house of Israel , but for my holy name , which you have profaned among the nations , where you went .
for I will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
I will also give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you a heart of flesh .
I will put my Spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and you shall keep my ordinances , and do them .
you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers ; and you shall be my people , and I will be your God .
I will save you from all your uncleanness : and I will call for the grain , and will multiply it , and lay no famine on you .
I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that you may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations .
then you shall remember your evil ways , and your doings that were not good ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
nor for your sake do I [ this ] , says the Lord Yahweh , be it known to you : be ashamed and confounded for your ways , house of Israel .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities , I will cause the cities to be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built .
the land that was desolate shall be tilled , whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed by .
they shall say , This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden ; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited .
then the nations that are left around you shall know that I , Yahweh , have built the ruined places , and planted that which was desolate : I , Yahweh , have spoken it , and I will do it .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : for this , moreover , will I be inquired of by the house of Israel , to do it for them : I will increase them with men like a flock .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts , so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh , and set me down in the midst of the valley ; and it was full of bones .
he caused me to pass by them all around : and behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and behold , they were very dry .
he said to me , Son of man , can these bones live ? I answered , Lord Yahweh , you know .
again he said to me , Prophesy over these bones , and tell them , you dry bones , hear the word of Yahweh .
thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones : behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and you shall live .
I will lay sinews on you , and will bring up flesh on you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and you shall live ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
so I prophesied as I was commanded : and as I prophesied , there was a noise , and behold , an earthquake ; and the bones came together , bone to its bone .
I saw , and , behold , there were sinews on them , and flesh came up , and skin covered them above ; but there was no breath in them .
then he said to me , Son of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel : behold , they say , Our bones are dried up , and our hope is lost ; we are clean cut off .
therefore prophesy , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , my people ; and I will bring you into the land of Israel .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
I will put my Spirit in you , and you shall live , and I will place you in your own land : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it and performed it , says Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh came again to me , saying ,
you , son of man , take one stick , and write on it , For Judah , and for the children of Israel his companions : then take another stick , and write on it , For Joseph , the stick of Ephraim , and [ for ] all the house of Israel his companions :
and join them for you one to another into one stick , that they may become one in your hand .
when the children of your people shall speak to you , saying , Will you not show us what you mean by these ?
the sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes .
say to them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the nations , where they are gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all ;
my servant David shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one shepherd : they shall also walk in my ordinances , and observe my statutes , and do them .
they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant , in which your fathers lived ; and they shall dwell therein , they , and their children , and their children 's children , forever : and David my servant shall be their prince for ever .
moreover I will make a Covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting Covenant with them ; and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore .
my tent also shall be with them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
the nations shall know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel , when my sanctuary shall be in their midst forevermore .
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , set your face toward Gog , of the land of Magog , the prince of Rosh , Meshech , and Tubal , and prophesy against him ,
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against you , Gog , prince of Rosh , Meshech , and Tubal :
Persia , Cush , and Put with them , all of them with shield and helmet ;
Gomer , and all his hordes ; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north , and all his hordes ; even many peoples with you .
be prepared , yes , prepare yourself , you , and all your companies who are assembled to you , and be a guard to them .
you shall ascend , you shall come like a storm , you shall be like a cloud to cover the land , you , and all your hordes , and many peoples with you .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : it shall happen in that day , that things shall come into your mind , and you shall devise an evil device :
therefore , son of man , prophesy , and tell Gog , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in that day when my people Israel dwells securely , shall you not know it ?
you shall come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north , you , and many peoples with you , all of them riding on horses , a great company and a mighty army ;
it shall happen in that day , when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains , says the Lord Yahweh : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him ; and I will rain on him , and on his hordes , and on the many peoples who are with him , an overflowing shower , and great hailstones , fire , and sulfur .
I will magnify myself , and sanctify myself , and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
you , son of man , prophesy against Gog , and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against you , Gog , prince of Rosh , Meshech , and Tubal :
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
and I will strike your bow out of your left hand , and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand .
you shall fall on the mountains of Israel , you , and all your hordes , and the peoples who are with you : I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort , and to the animals of the field to be devoured .
you shall fall on the open field ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will send a fire on Magog , and on those who dwell securely in the islands ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel ; neither will I allow my holy name to be profaned any more : and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh , the Holy One in Israel .
behold , it comes , and it shall be done , says the Lord Yahweh ; this is the day about which I have spoken .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall make fires of the weapons ; and they shall plunder those who plundered them , and rob those who robbed them , says the Lord Yahweh .
seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them , that they may cleanse the land .
yes , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified , says the Lord Yahweh .
those who pass through the land shall pass through ; and when any sees a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , until the undertakers have buried it in the valley of Hamon Gog .
Hamonah shall also be the name of a city . thus shall they cleanse the land .
you shall eat fat until you be full , and drink blood until you are drunk , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
you shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will set my glory among the nations ; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid on them .
so the house of Israel shall know that I am Yahweh their God , from that day and forward .
the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity ; because they trespassed against me , and I hid my face from them : so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries , and they fell all of them by the sword .
according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I to them ; and I hid my face from them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob , and have mercy on the whole house of Israel ; and I will be Jealous for my holy name .
they shall bear their shame , and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me , when they shall dwell securely in their land , and none shall make them afraid ;
when I have brought them back from the peoples , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations .
they shall know that I am Yahweh their God , in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations , and have gathered them to their own land ; and I will leave none of them any more there ;
neither will I hide my face any more from them ; for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh .
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck , in the same day , the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me there .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me down on a very high mountain , whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south .
he brought me there ; and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring Reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he measured the threshold of the gate , one Reed broad ; and the other threshold , one Reed broad .
every lodge was one Reed long , and one Reed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lodges was five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one Reed .
he measured also the porch of the gate toward the house , one Reed .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and its posts , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was toward the house .
he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate , ten cubits ; and the length of the gate , thirteen cubits ;
and a border before the lodges , one cubit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cubit on that side ; and the lodges , six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other , a breadth of twenty @-@ five cubits ; door against door .
he made also posts , sixty cubits ; and the court [ reached ] to the posts , around the gate .
[ from ] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits .
then brought he me into the outer court ; and behold , there were rooms and a pavement , made for the court all around : thirty rooms were on the pavement .
the pavement was by the side of the gates , answerable to the length of the gates , even the lower pavement .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside , one hundred cubits , [ both ] on the east and on the north .
the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north , he measured its length and its breadth .
the lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate : its length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty @-@ five cubits .
the windows of it , and its arches , and the palm trees of it , were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and its arches were before them .
there was a gate to the inner court over against the [ other ] gate , [ both ] on the north and on the east ; and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits .
he led me toward the south ; and behold , a gate toward the south : and he measured its posts and its arches according to these measures .
there were windows in it and in its arches all around , like those windows : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty @-@ five cubits .
there were seven steps to go up to it , and its arches were before them ; and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , on its posts .
there was a gate to the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits .
then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate : and he measured the south gate according to these measures ;
and its lodges , and its posts , and its arches , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in its arches all around ; it was fifty cubits long , and twenty @-@ five cubits broad .
he brought me into the inner court toward the east : and he measured the gate according to these measures ;
and its lodges , and its posts , and its arches , according to these measures : and there were windows therein and in its arches all around ; it was fifty cubits long , and twenty @-@ five cubits broad .
the arches of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
he brought me to the north gate : and he measured [ it ] according to these measures ;
its lodges , its posts , and its arches : and there were windows therein all around ; the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty @-@ five cubits .
the posts of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
a room with its door was by the posts at the gates ; there they washed the burnt offering .
in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to kill thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering .
on the [ one ] side outside , as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north , were two tables ; and on the other side , which belonged to the porch of the gate , were two tables .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they killed [ the sacrifices ] .
the hooks , a handbreadth long , were fastened within all around : and on the tables was the flesh of the offering .
outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south ; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
he said to me , This room , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the duty of the house ;
and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the duty of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok , who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him .
he measured the court , one hundred cubits long , and a hundred cubits broad , foursquare ; and the altar was before the house .
then he brought me to the porch of the house , and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tent .
then went he inward , and measured each post of the entrance , two cubits ; and the entrance , six cubits ; and the breadth of the entrance , seven cubits .
he measured its length , twenty cubits , and the breadth , twenty cubits , before the temple : and he said to me , This is the most holy place .
then he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side room , four cubits , all around the house on every side .
I saw also that the house had a raised base all around : the foundations of the side rooms were a full Reed of six great cubits .
the thickness of the wall , which was for the side rooms , on the outside , was five cubits : and that which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits all around .
the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around , and its length ninety cubits .
so he measured the house , one hundred cubits long ; and the separate place , and the building , with its walls , one hundred cubits long ;
also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , one hundred cubits .
he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back , and its galleries on the one side and on the other side , one hundred cubits ; and the inner temple , and the porches of the court ;
the thresholds , and the closed windows , and the galleries around on their three stories , over against the threshold , with wood ceilings all around , and [ from ] the ground up to the windows , ( now the windows were covered ) ,
to [ the space ] above the door , even to the inner house , and outside , and by all the wall all around inside and outside , by measure .
it was made with cherubim and palm trees ; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub , and every cherub had two faces ;
so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side . [ thus was it ] made through all the house all around :
from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made : thus was the wall of the temple .
as for the temple , the door posts were squared ; and as for the face of the sanctuary , the appearance [ of it ] was as the appearance [ of the temple ] .
the altar was of wood , three cubits high , and its length two cubits ; and its corners , and its length , and its walls , were of wood : and he said to me , This is the table that is before Yahweh .
the temple and the sanctuary had two doors .
the doors had two leaves [ apiece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubim and palm trees , like as were made on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
before the length of one hundred cubits was the north door , and the breadth was fifty cubits .
over against the twenty [ cubits ] which belonged to the inner court , and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court , was gallery against gallery in the third story .
before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits ' breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and their doors were toward the north .
now the upper rooms were shorter ; for the galleries took away from these , more than from the lower and the middle , in the building .
for they were in three stories , and they didn 't have pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore [ the uppermost ] was straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground .
the wall that was outside by the side of the rooms , toward the outer court before the rooms , its length was fifty cubits .
for the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits : and behold , before the temple were one hundred cubits .
from under these rooms was the entry on the east side , as one goes into them from the outer court .
in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , before the separate place , and before the building , there were rooms .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it all around .
he measured on the east side with the measuring Reed five hundred reeds , with the measuring Reed all around .
he measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring Reed all around .
he measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring Reed .
he turned about to the west side , and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring Reed .
afterward he brought me to the gate , even the gate that looks toward the east .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the earth shined with his glory .
it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city ; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell on my face .
the glory of Yahweh came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
the Spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house .
I heard one speaking to me out of the house ; and a man stood by me .
in their setting of their threshold by my threshold , and their doorpost beside my doorpost , and there was [ but ] the wall between me and them ; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed : therefore I have consumed them in my anger .
now let them put away their prostitution , and the dead bodies of their kings , far from me ; and I will dwell in their midst forever .
you , son of man , show the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities ; and let them measure the pattern .
this is the law of the house : on the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy . behold , this is the law of the house .
from the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits , and the breadth one cubit ; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits , and the breadth a cubit .
the upper altar shall be four cubits ; and from the altar Hearth and upward there shall be four horns .
the altar Hearth shall be twelve [ cubits ] long by twelve broad , square in the four sides of it .
the ledge shall be fourteen [ cubits ] long by fourteen broad in the four sides of it ; and the border about it shall be half a cubit ; and its bottom shall be a cubit around ; and its steps shall look toward the east .
he said to me , Son of man , thus says the Lord Yahweh : these are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
you shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yahweh , a young bull for a sin offering .
you shall take of its blood , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the ledge , and on the border all around : thus you shall cleanse it and make Atonement for it .
you shall also take the bull of the sin offering , and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house , outside of the sanctuary .
on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering ; and they shall cleanse the altar , as they cleansed it with the bull .
when you have finished cleansing it , you shall offer a young bull without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
you shall bring them near to Yahweh , and the priests shall cast salt on them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering : they shall also prepare a young bull , and a ram out of the flock , without blemish .
seven days shall they make Atonement for the altar and purify it ; so shall they consecrate it .
when they have accomplished the days , it shall be that on the eighth day , and forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , says the Lord Yahweh .
then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary , which looks toward the east ; and it was shut .
Yahweh said to me , This gate shall be shut ; it shall not be opened , neither shall any man enter in by it ; for Yahweh , the God of Israel , has entered in by it ; therefore it shall be shut .
as for the prince , he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Yahweh ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh : and I fell on my face .
you shall tell the rebellious , even to the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : you house of Israel , let it suffice you of all your abominations ,
in that you have brought in foreigners , uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in my sanctuary , to profane it , even my house , when you offer my bread , the fat and the blood , and they have broken my Covenant , [ to add ] to all your abominations .
you have not performed the duty of my holy things ; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves .
thus says the Lord Yahweh , No foreigner , uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my sanctuary , of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel .
but the Levites who went far from me , when Israel went astray , who went astray from me after their idols , they shall bear their iniquity .
because they ministered to them before their idols , and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel ; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them , says the Lord Yahweh , and they shall bear their iniquity .
they shall not come near to me , to execute the office of priest to me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , to the things that are most holy ; but they shall bear their shame , and their abominations which they have committed .
yet will I make them performers of the duty of the house , for all its service , and for all that shall be done therein .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister to me , and they shall keep my instruction .
it shall be that , when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linen garments ; and no wool shall come on them , while they minister in the gates of the inner court , and within .
they shall have linen tires on their heads , and shall have linen breeches on their waists ; they shall not clothe themselves with [ anything that causes ] sweat .
neither shall they shave their heads , nor allow their locks to grow long ; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads .
neither shall any of the priests drink wine , when they enter into the inner court .
neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her who is put away ; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow who is the widow of a priest .
they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
in a controversy they shall stand to judge ; according to my ordinances shall they judge it : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts ; and they shall make my Sabbaths holy .
they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves ; but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister who has had no husband , they may defile themselves .
after he is cleansed , they shall reckon to him seven days .
in the day that he goes into the sanctuary , into the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer his sin offering , says the Lord Yahweh .
they shall have an inheritance : I am their inheritance ; and you shall give them no possession in Israel ; I am their possession .
they shall eat the meal offering , and the sin offering , and the trespass offering ; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs .
the first of all the first fruits of every thing , and every offering of everything , of all your offerings , shall be for the priest : you shall also give to the priests the first of your dough , to cause a blessing to rest on your house .
the priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself , or is torn , whether it be bird or animal .
moreover , when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance , you shall offer an offering to Yahweh , a holy portion of the land ; the length shall be the length of twenty @-@ five thousand [ reeds ] , and the breadth shall be ten thousand : it shall be holy in all its border all around .
of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred [ in length ] by five hundred [ in breadth ] , square all around ; and fifty cubits for its suburbs all around .
of this measure you shall measure a length of twenty @-@ five thousand , and a breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary , which is most holy .
it is a holy portion of the land ; it shall be for the priests , the ministers of the sanctuary , who come near to minister to Yahweh ; and it shall be a place for their houses , and a holy place for the sanctuary .
you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and twenty @-@ five thousand long , side by side with the offering of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
in the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel : and my princes shall no more oppress my people ; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : let it suffice you , princes of Israel : remove violence and spoil , and execute justice and righteousness ; dispossessing my people , says the Lord Yahweh .
you shall have just balances , and a just ephah , and a just bath .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of a Homer : its measure shall be after the Homer .
the shekel shall be twenty gerahs . twenty shekels plus twenty @-@ five shekels plus fifteen shekels shall be your Mina .
this is the offering that you shall offer : the sixth part of an ephah from a Homer of wheat ; and you shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a Homer of barley ;
and the set portion of oil , of the bath of oil , the tenth part of a bath out of the Cor , [ which is ] ten baths , even a Homer ; ( for ten baths are a Homer ; )
all the people of the land shall give to this offering for the prince in Israel .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bull without blemish ; and you shall cleanse the sanctuary .
the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it on the door posts of the house , and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar , and on the posts of the gate of the inner court .
so you shall do on the seventh [ day ] of the month for everyone who errs , and for him who is simple : so you shall make Atonement for the house .
in the first [ month ] , in the fourteenth day of the month , you shall have the Passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
on that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering .
the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to Yahweh , seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days ; and a male goat daily for a sin offering .
he shall prepare a meal offering , an ephah for a bull , and an ephah for a ram , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
in the seventh [ month ] , in the fifteenth day of the month , in the feast , shall he do the like the seven days ; according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meal offering , and according to the oil .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : the gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened , and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons .
the burnt offering that the prince shall offer to Yahweh shall be on the Sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish ;
and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram , and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram ; they shall be without blemish :
and he shall prepare a meal offering , an ephah for the bull , and an ephah for the ram , and for the lambs according as he is able , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate , and he shall go forth by its way .
the prince , when they go in , shall go in with of them ; and when they go out , he shall go out .
in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an ephah for a bull , and an ephah for a ram , and for the lambs as he is able to give , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
you shall prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to Yahweh daily : morning by morning you shall prepare it .
thus shall they prepare the lamb , and the meal offering , and the oil , morning by morning , for a continual burnt offering .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : if the prince give a gift to any of his sons , it is his inheritance , it shall belong to his sons ; it is their possession by inheritance .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part westward .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
in the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed , forty [ cubits ] long and thirty broad : these four in the corners were of one measure .
there was a wall around in them , around the four , and boiling places were made under the walls all around .
then he said to me , These are the boiling houses , where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people .
then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward , and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate , by the way of [ the gate ] that looks toward the east ; and behold , there ran out waters on the right side .
when the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand , he measured one thousand cubits , and he caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the ankles .
again he measured one thousand , and caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the knees . again he measured one thousand , and caused me to pass through [ the waters ] , waters that were to the waist .
afterward he measured one thousand ; [ and it was ] a river that I could not pass through ; for the waters were risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed through .
he said to me , Son of man , have you seen [ this ] ? then he brought me , and caused me to return to the bank of the river .
now when I had returned , behold , on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
it shall happen , that fishermen shall stand by it : from En Gedi even to En Eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets ; their fish shall be after their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
but the miry places of it , and its marshes , shall not be healed ; they shall be given up to salt .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : this shall be the border , by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel : Joseph [ shall have two ] portions .
you shall inherit it , one as well as another ; for I swore to give it to your fathers : and this land shall fall to you for inheritance .
this shall be the border of the land : on the north side , from the great sea , by the way of Hethlon , to the entrance of Zedad ;
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazer Hatticon , which is by the border of Hauran .
the border from the sea , shall be Hazar Enon at the border of Damascus ; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath . this is the north side .
the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh , to the Brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea . this is the south side southward .
the west side shall be the great sea , from the [ south ] border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath . this is the west side .
so you shall divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel .
it shall happen , that in what tribe the stranger lives , there you shall give him his inheritance , says the Lord Yahweh .
by the border of Dan , from the east side to the west side , Asher , one [ portion ] .

by the border of Ephraim , from the east side even to the west side , Reuben , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Reuben , from the east side to the west side , Judah , one [ portion ] .
the offering that you shall offer to Yahweh shall be twenty @-@ five thousand [ reeds ] in length , and ten thousand in breadth .
[ it shall be ] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok , who have kept my instruction , who didn 't go astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
it shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land , a thing most holy , by the border of the Levites .
answerable to the border of the priests , the Levites shall have twenty @-@ five thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth : all the length shall be twenty @-@ five thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
they shall sell none of it , nor exchange it , nor shall the first fruits of the land be alienated ; for it is holy to Yahweh .
these shall be its measures : the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
the city shall have suburbs : toward the north two hundred fifty , and toward the south two hundred fifty , and toward the east two hundred fifty , and toward the west two hundred fifty .
those who labor in the city , out of all the tribes of Israel , shall cultivate it .
all the offering shall be twenty @-@ five thousand by twenty @-@ five thousand : you shall offer the holy offering foursquare , with the possession of the city .
moreover from the possession of the Levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , it shall be for the prince .
as for the rest of the tribes : from the east side to the west side , Benjamin , one [ portion ] .

this is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their several portions , says the Lord Yahweh .
at the east side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , and three gates : even the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Issachar , one ; the gate of Zebulun , one .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , with their three gates : the gate of Gad , one ; the gate of Asher , one ; the gate of Naphtali , one .
it shall be Eighteen thousand [ reeds ] around : and the name of the city from that day shall be , Yahweh is there .
in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem , and besieged it .
the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God ; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god : and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's dainties , and of the wine which he drank , and that they should be nourished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
now among these were , of the children of Judah , Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
the prince of the eunuchs gave names to them : to Daniel he gave [ the name of ] Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , [ of ] Shadrach ; and to Mishael , [ of ] Meshach ; and to Azariah , [ of ] Abednego .
now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs .
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the youths who eat of the king 's dainties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
so he listened to them in this matter , and proved them ten days .
at the end of ten days their faces appeared fairer , and they were fatter in flesh , than all the youths who ate of the king 's dainties .
so the steward took away their dainties , and the wine that they should drink , and gave them pulse .
now as for these four youths , God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom : and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in , the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
the king talked with them ; and among them all was found none like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah : therefore stood they before the king .
in every matter of wisdom and understanding , concerning which the king inquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm .
Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus .
in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sleep went from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the enchanters , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , to tell the king his dreams . so they came in and stood before the king .
the king said to them , I have dreamed a dream , and my spirit is troubled to know the dream .
then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language , O king , live forever : tell your servants the dream , and we will show the interpretation .
the king answered the Chaldeans , The thing is gone from me : if you don 't make known to me the dream and its interpretation , you shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
but if you show the dream and its interpretation , you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor : therefore show me the dream and its interpretation .
they answered the second time and said , Let the king tell his servants the dream , and we will show the interpretation .
the king answered , I know of a certainty that you would gain time , because you see the thing is gone from me .
it is a rare thing that the king requires , and there is no other who can show it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
so the decree went forth , and the wise men were to be slain ; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain .
then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king 's guard , who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon ;
he answered Arioch the king 's captain , Why is the decree so urgent from the king ? then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel .
Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpretation .
then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , his companions :
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night . then Daniel blessed the God of heaven .
Daniel answered , blessed be the name of God forever and ever ; for wisdom and might are his .
he changes the times and the seasons ; he removes kings , and sets up kings ; he gives wisdom to the wise , and knowledge to those who have understanding ;
he reveals the deep and secret things ; he knows what is in the darkness , and the light dwells with him .
therefore Daniel went in to Arioch , whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon ; he went and said thus to him : Don 't destroy the wise men of Babylon ; bring me in before the king , and I will show to the king the interpretation .
then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste , and said thus to him , I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah , who will make known to the king the interpretation .
the king answered Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen , and its interpretation ?
Daniel answered before the king , and said , The secret which the king has demanded can neither wise men , enchanters , magicians , nor soothsayers , show to the king ;
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for you , O king , your thoughts came [ into your mind ] on your bed , what should happen hereafter ; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen .
you , O king , saw , and behold , a great image . this image , which was mighty , and whose brightness was excellent , stood before you ; and its aspect was awesome .
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its breast and its arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of brass ,
its legs of iron , its feet part of iron , and part of clay .
you saw until a stone was cut out without hands , which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay , and broke them in pieces .
this is the dream ; and we will tell its interpretation before the king .
you , O king , are king of kings , to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom , the power , and the strength , and the glory ;
and wherever the children of men dwell , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you ; and another third kingdom of brass , which shall bear rule over all the earth .
the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron , because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things ; and as iron that crushes all these , shall it break in pieces and crush .
as the toes of the feet were part of iron , and part of clay , so the kingdom shall be partly strong , and partly broken .
whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay , they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men ; but they shall not cling to one another , even as iron does not mingle with clay .
then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face , and worshiped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him .
the king answered to Daniel , and said , Of a truth your God is the God of gods , and the Lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , since you have been able to reveal this secret .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon .
Daniel requested of the king , and he appointed Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , over the affairs of the province of Babylon : but Daniel was in the gate of the king .
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold , whose height was sixty cubits , and its breadth six cubits : he set it up in the plain of Dura , in the province of Babylon .
then the herald cried aloud , To you it is commanded , peoples , nations , and languages ,
that whenever you hear the sound of the Horn , flute , zither , Lyre , harp , pipe , and all kinds of music , you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up ;
and whoever doesn 't fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
therefore at that time , when all the peoples heard the sound of the Horn , flute , zither , Lyre , harp , pipe , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near , and brought accusation against the Jews .
they answered Nebuchadnezzar the king , O king , live for ever .
then Nebuchadnezzar in [ his ] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . then they brought these men before the king .
Nebuchadnezzar answered them , Is it on purpose , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , that you don 't serve my god , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego answered the king , Nebuchadnezzar , we have no need to answer you in this matter .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
but if not , be it known to you , O king , that we will not serve your gods , nor worship the golden image which you have set up .
then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego : [ therefore ] he spoke , and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated .
he commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , [ and ] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
then these men were bound in their pants , their tunics , and their mantles , and their [ other ] garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
therefore because the king 's commandment was urgent , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego .
these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then the king promoted Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego in the province of Babylon .
Nebuchadnezzar the king , to all the peoples , nations , and languages , who dwell in all the earth : peace be multiplied to you .
it has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked toward me .
how great are his signs ! and how mighty are his wonders ! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is from generation to generation .
I , Nebuchadnezzar , was at rest in my house , and flourishing in my palace .
I saw a dream which made me afraid ; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpretation .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and I told the dream before him , [ saying ] ,
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth ; and its height was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and its height reached to the sky , and its sight to the end of all the earth .
the leaves of it were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all : the animals of the field had shadow under it , and the birds of the sky lived in its branches , and all flesh was fed from it .
I saw in the visions of my head on my bed , and behold , a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky .
nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky : and let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth :
let his heart be changed from man 's , and let an animal 's heart be given to him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that you saw , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached to the sky , and its sight to all the earth ;
whose leaves were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all ; under which the animals of the field lived , and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habitation :
it is you , O king , that are grown and become strong ; for your greatness is grown , and reaches to the sky , and your dominion to the end of the earth .
this is the interpretation , O king , and it is the decree of the Most High , which has come on my lord the king :
whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree ; your kingdom shall be sure to you , after that you shall have known that the heavens do rule .
all this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar .
at the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon .
the king spoke and said , Is not this great Babylon , which I have built for the royal dwelling place , by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : the kingdom has departed from you :
Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords , and drank wine before the thousand .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God 's house which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , drank from them .
they drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour came forth the fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his thoughts troubled him ; and the joints of his thighs were loosened , and his knees struck one against another .
then came in all the king 's wise men ; but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation .
then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled , and his face was changed in him , and his lords were perplexed .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . the king spoke and said to Daniel , Are you that Daniel , who are of the children of the captivity of Judah , whom the king my father brought out of Judah ?
I have heard of you , that the spirit of the gods is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
now the wise men , the enchanters , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known to me its interpretation ; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing .
then Daniel answered before the king , Let your gifts be to yourself , and give your rewards to another ; nevertheless I will read the writing to the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
you , king , the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and majesty :
and because of the greatness that he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages trembled and feared before him : whom he would he killed , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
but when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
you , his son , Belshazzar , have not humbled your heart , though you knew all this ,
then was the part of the hand sent from before him , and this writing was inscribed .
this is the writing that was inscribed : MENE , MENE , Tekel , UPHARSIN .
this is the interpretation of the thing : MENE ; God has numbered your kingdom , and brought it to an end ;
Tekel ; you are weighed in the balances , and are found wanting .
Peres ; your kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians .
then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with purple , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
in that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain .
Darius the Mede received the kingdom , being about sixty @-@ two years old .
it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps , who should be throughout the whole kingdom ;
and over them three presidents , of whom Daniel was one ; that these satraps might give account to them , and that the king should have no damage .
then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
then these men said , We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel , except we find it against him concerning the law of his God .
then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king , and said thus to him , King Darius , live forever .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it not be changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which doesn 't alter .
therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree .
then these men assembled together , and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God .
then answered they and said before the king , That Daniel , who is of the children of the captivity of Judah , doesn 't respect you , O king , nor the decree that you have signed , but makes his petition three times a day .
then the king , when he heard these words , was very displeased , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him .
then these men assembled together to the king , and said to the king , Know , O king , that it is a law of the Medes and Persians , that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Your God whom you serve continually , he will deliver you .
a stone was brought , and laid on the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sleep fled from him .
then the king arose very early in the morning , and went in haste to the den of lions .
then Daniel said to the king , O king , live forever .
my God has sent his angel , and has shut the lions ' mouths , and they have not hurt me ; because as before him innocence was found in me ; and also before you , O king , have I done no hurt .
then was the king exceeding glad , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had trusted in his God .
then king Darius wrote to all the peoples , nations , and languages , who dwell in all the earth : peace be multiplied to you .
I make a decree , that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel ; for he is the living God , and steadfast forever , His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed ; and his dominion shall be even to the end .
he delivers and rescues , and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth , who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions .
so this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius , and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian .
in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed : then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters .
Daniel spoke and said , I saw in my vision by night , and , behold , the four winds of the sky broke forth on the great sea .
four great animals came up from the sea , diverse one from another .
the first was like a lion , and had eagle 's wings : I saw until its wings were plucked , and it was lifted up from the earth , and made to stand on two feet as a man ; and a man 's heart was given to it .
after this I saw , and behold , another , like a Leopard , which had on its back four wings of a bird ; the animal had also four heads ; and dominion was given to it .
I saw until thrones were placed , and one who was ancient of days sat : his clothing was white as snow , and the hair of his head like pure wool ; his throne was fiery flames , [ and ] its wheels burning fire .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousands of thousands ministered to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the Horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was slain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
as for the rest of the animals , their dominion was taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time .
I saw in the night visions , and behold , there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man , and he came even to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all the peoples , nations , and languages should serve him : his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
as for me , Daniel , my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near to one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth concerning all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
these great animals , which are four , are four kings , who shall arise out of the earth .
but the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom , and possess the kingdom forever , even forever and ever .
I saw , and the same Horn made war with the saints , and prevailed against them ;
until the ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High , and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
thus he said , The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth , which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
as for the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
but the judgment shall be set , and they shall take away his dominion , to consume and to destroy it to the end .
here is the end of the matter . as for me , Daniel , my thoughts much troubled me , and my face was changed in me : but I kept the matter in my heart .
in the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me , even to me , Daniel , after that which appeared to me at the first .
I saw in the vision ; now it was so , that when I saw , I was in the citadel of Susa , which is in the province of Elam ; and I saw in the vision , and I was by the river Ulai .
then I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
as I was considering , behold , a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth , and didn 't touch the ground : and the goat had a notable Horn between his eyes .
he came to the ram that had the two horns , which I saw standing before the river , and ran on him in the fury of his power .
the male goat magnified himself exceedingly : and when he was strong , the great Horn was broken ; and instead of it there came up four notable [ horns ] toward the four winds of the sky .
out of one of them came forth a little Horn , which grew exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the glorious [ land ] .
it grew great , even to the army of the sky ; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the ground , and trampled on them .
yes , it magnified itself , even to the prince of the army ; and it took away from him the continual [ burnt offering ] , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
the army was given over [ to it ] together with the continual [ burnt offering ] through disobedience ; and it cast down truth to the ground , and it did [ its pleasure ] and prospered .
he said to me , To two thousand and three hundred evenings [ and ] mornings ; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
I heard a man 's voice between [ the banks of ] the Ulai , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
so he came near where I stood ; and when he came , I was frightened , and fell on my face : but he said to me , understand , son of man ; for the vision belongs to the time of the end .
now as he was speaking with me , I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground ; but he touched me , and set me upright .
he said , behold , I will make you know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation ; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end .
the ram which you saw , that had the two horns , they are the kings of Media and Persia .
the rough male goat is the king of Greece : and the great Horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
as for that which was broken , in the place where four stood up , four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation , but not with his power .
in the latter time of their kingdom , when the transgressors have come to the full , a king of fierce face , and understanding dark sentences , shall stand up .
his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper and do [ his pleasure ] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magnify himself in his heart , and in [ their ] security shall he destroy many : he shall also stand up against the prince of princes ; but he shall be broken without hand .
the vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true : but seal up the vision ; for it belongs to many days [ to come ] .
I , Daniel , fainted , and was sick certain days ; then I rose up , and did the king 's business : and I wondered at the vision , but none understood it .
I set my face to the Lord God , to seek by prayer and petitions , with fasting and sackcloth and ashes .
we have sinned , and have dealt perversely , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances ;
neither have we listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
Lord , to us belongs confusion of face , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers , because we have sinned against you .
to the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness ; for we have rebelled against him ;
neither have we obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
as it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil has come on us : yet have we not entreated the favor of Yahweh our God , that we should turn from our iniquities , and have discernment in your truth .
therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil , and brought it on us ; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does , and we have not obeyed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
now therefore , our God , listen to the prayer of your servant , and to his petitions , and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord 's sake .
my God , turn your ear , and hear ; open your eyes , and see our desolations , and the city which is called by your name : for we do not present our petitions before you for our righteousness , but for your great mercies ' sake .
Lord , hear ; Lord , forgive ; Lord , listen and do ; don 't defer , for your own sake , my God , because your city and your people are called by your name .
while I was speaking , and praying , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before Yahweh my God for the holy mountain of my God ;
yes , while I was speaking in prayer , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
he instructed me , and talked with me , and said , Daniel , I am now come forth to give you wisdom and understanding .
in those days I , Daniel , was mourning three whole weeks .
I ate no pleasant bread , neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth , neither did I anoint myself at all , until three whole weeks were fulfilled .
in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is Hiddekel ,
I lifted up my eyes , and looked , and behold , a man clothed in linen , whose thighs were adorned with pure gold of Uphaz :
I , Daniel , alone saw the vision ; for the men who were with me didn 't see the vision ; but a great quaking fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
behold , a hand touched me , which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty @-@ one days ; but , behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days ; for the vision is yet for [ many ] days :
and when he had spoken to me according to these words , I set my face toward the ground , and was mute .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there breath left in me .
then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthened me .
then he said , " Do you know why I have come to you ? now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia . when I go forth , behold , the prince of Greece shall come .
but I will tell you that which is inscribed in the writing of truth : and there is none who holds with me against these , but Michael your prince . "
" as for me , in the first year of Darius the Mede , I stood up to confirm and strengthen him .
a mighty king shall stand up , who shall rule with great dominion , and do according to his will .
the king of the south shall be strong , and [ one ] of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
but out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place , who shall come to the army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prevail .
also their gods , with their molten images , [ and ] with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold , shall he carry captive into Egypt ; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north .
he shall come into the realm of the king of the south , but he shall return into his own land .
his sons shall war , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces , which shall come on , and overflow , and pass through ; and they shall return and war , even to his fortress .
the king of the south shall be moved with anger , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north ; and he shall set forth a great multitude , and the multitude shall be given into his hand .
the multitude shall be lifted up , and his heart shall be exalted ; and he shall cast down tens of thousands , but he shall not prevail .
the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former ; and he shall come on at the end of the times , [ even of ] years , with a great army and with much substance .
in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the children of the violent among your people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
but he who comes against him shall do according to his own will , and none shall stand before him ; and he shall stand in the glorious land , and in his hand shall be destruction .
after this shall he turn his face to the islands , and shall take many : but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ; yes , moreover , he shall cause his reproach to turn on him .
then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land ; but he shall stumble and fall , and shall not be found .
then shall stand up in his place one who shall cause a tax collector to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory ; but within few days he shall be destroyed , neither in anger , nor in battle .
in his place shall stand up a contemptible person , to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom : but he shall come in time of security , and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him , and shall be broken ; yes , also the prince of the Covenant .
after the treaty made with him he shall work deceitfully ; for he shall come up , and shall become strong , with a small people .
yes , they who eat of his dainties shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow ; and many shall fall down slain .
as for both these kings , their hearts shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table : but it shall not prosper ; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy Covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come into the south ; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former .
for ships of Kittim shall come against him ; therefore he shall be grieved , and shall return , and have indignation against the holy Covenant , and shall do [ his pleasure ] : he shall even return , and have regard to those who forsake the holy Covenant .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall profane the sanctuary , even the fortress , and shall take away the continual [ burnt offering ] , and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate .
such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he pervert by flatteries ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and do [ exploits ] .
those who are wise among the people shall instruct many ; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame , by captivity and by spoil , [ many ] days .
now when they shall fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall join themselves to them with flatteries .
neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god ; for he shall magnify himself above all .
but in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses ; and a god whom his fathers didn 't know shall he honor with gold , and silver , and with precious stones , and pleasant things .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many [ countries ] shall be overthrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
he shall stretch forth his hand also on the countries ; and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt ; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
but news out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him ; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many .
he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
those who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse ; and those who turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever .
but you , Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run back and forth , and knowledge shall be increased . "
then I , Daniel , looked , and behold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
one said to the man clothed in linen , who was above the waters of the river , How long shall it be to the end of these wonders ?
I heard , but I didn 't understand : then I said , my lord , what shall be the issue of these things ?
he said , Go your way , Daniel ; for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end .
many shall purify themselves , and make themselves white , and be refined ; but the wicked shall do wickedly ; and none of the wicked shall understand ; but those who are wise shall understand .
from the time that the continual burnt offering shall be taken away , and the abomination that makes desolate set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days .
blessed is he who waits , and comes to the one thousand three hundred thirty @-@ five days .
but go you your way until the end ; for you shall rest , and shall stand in your lot , at the end of the days .
the word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
when Yahweh spoke at first by Hosea , Yahweh said to Hosea , " Go , take for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness ; for the land commits great adultery , forsaking Yahweh . "
so he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim ; and she conceived , and bore him a son .
Yahweh said to him , " Call his name Jezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu , and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease .
it will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel . "
she conceived again , and bore a daughter . then he said to him , " Call her name Lo @-@ Ruhamah ; for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel , that I should in any way pardon them .
but I will have mercy on the house of Judah , and will save them by Yahweh their God , and will not save them by bow , sword , battle , horses , or horsemen . "
now when she had weaned Lo @-@ Ruhamah , she conceived , and bore a son .
he said , " Call his name Lo @-@ Ammi ; for you are not my people , and I will not be yours .
yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea , which can 't be measured nor numbered ; and it will come to pass that , in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' they will be called ' sons of the living God . '
the children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together , and they will appoint themselves one head , and will go up from the land ; for great will be the day of Jezreel .
" say to your brothers , ' My people ! ' and to your sisters , ' My loved one ! '
contend with your mother ! contend , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband ; and let her put away her prostitution from her face , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
Lest I strip her naked , and make her bare as in the day that she was born , and make her like a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and kill her with thirst .
indeed , on her children I will have no mercy ; for they are children of unfaithfulness ;
therefore behold , I will hedge up your way with thorns , and I will build a wall against her , that she can 't find her way .
for she did not know that I gave her the grain , the new wine , and the oil , and multiplied to her silver and gold , which they used for Baal .
therefore I will take back my grain in its time , and my new wine in its season , and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness .
now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers , and no one will deliver her out of my hand .
I will also cause all her celebrations to cease : her feasts , her new moons , her Sabbaths , and all her solemn assemblies .
I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees , about which she has said , ' These are my wages that my lovers have given me ; and I will make them a forest , ' and the animals of the field shall eat them .
I will visit on her the days of the Baals , to which she burned incense , when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and went after her lovers , and forgot me , " says Yahweh .
" therefore behold , I will allure her , and bring her into the wilderness , and speak tenderly to her .
I will give her vineyards from there , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
for I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth , and they will no longer be mentioned by name .
I will betroth you to me forever . yes , I will betroth you to me in righteousness , in justice , in loving kindness , and in compassion .
I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness ; and you shall know Yahweh .
it will happen in that day , I will respond , " says Yahweh , " I will respond to the heavens , and they will respond to the earth ;
and the earth will respond to the grain , and the new wine , and the oil ; and they will respond to Jezreel .
I will sow her to me in the earth ; and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy ; and I will tell those who were not my people , ' You are my people ; ' and they will say , ' My God ! ' "
so I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a Homer and a half of barley .
I said to her , " You shall stay with me many days . you shall not play the prostitute , and you shall not be with any other man . I will also be so toward you . "
for the children of Israel shall live many days without king , and without prince , and without sacrifice , and without sacred stone , and without ephod or idols .
afterward the children of Israel shall return , and seek Yahweh their God , and David their king , and shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days .
hear the word of Yahweh , you children of Israel ; for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land : " indeed there is no truth , nor Goodness , nor knowledge of God in the land .
there is cursing , lying , murder , stealing , and committing adultery ; they break boundaries , and bloodshed causes bloodshed .
therefore the land will mourn , and everyone who dwells therein will waste away. all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
" yet let no man bring a charge , neither let any man accuse ; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest .
you will stumble in the day , and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night ; and I will destroy your mother .
it will be , like people , like priest ; and I will punish them for their ways , and will repay them for their deeds .
they will eat , and not have enough . they will play the prostitute , and will not increase ; because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh .
prostitution , wine , and new wine take away understanding .
my people consult with their wooden idol , and answer to a stick of wood . indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray , and they have been unfaithful to their God .
I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute , nor your brides when they commit adultery ; because the men consort with prostitutes , and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes ; so the people without understanding will come to ruin .
for Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly , like a stubborn heifer . then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a Meadow .
Ephraim is joined to idols . leave him alone !
their drink has become sour . they play the prostitute continually . her rulers dearly love their shameful way .
the wind has wrapped her up in its wings ; and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices .
the rebels are deep in slaughter ; but I discipline all of them .
I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hidden from me ; for now , Ephraim , you have played the prostitute . Israel is defiled .
their deeds won 't allow them to turn to their God ; for the spirit of prostitution is within them , and they don 't know Yahweh .
the pride of Israel testifies to his face . therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity . Judah also will stumble with them .
they will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh ; but they won 't find him . he has withdrawn himself from them .
they are unfaithful to Yahweh ; for they have borne illegitimate children . now the new moon will devour them with their fields .
" blow the cornet in Gibeah , and the trumpet in Ramah ! sound a battle cry at Beth Aven , behind you , Benjamin !
Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke . among the tribes of Israel , I have made known that which will surely be .
the princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark . I will pour out my wrath on them like water .
Ephraim is oppressed , he is crushed in judgment ; Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols .
therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth , and to the house of Judah like rottenness .
" when Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah his wound , Then Ephraim went to Assyria , and sent to king Jareb : but he is not able to heal you , neither will he cure you of your wound .
for I will be to Ephraim like a lion , and like a young lion to the house of Judah . I myself will tear in pieces and go away . I will carry off , and there will be no one to deliver .
I will go and return to my place , until they acknowledge their offense , and seek my face . in their affliction they will seek me earnestly . "
" come , and let us return to Yahweh ; for he has torn us to pieces , and he will heal us ; he has injured us , and he will bind up our wounds .
after two days he will revive us . on the third day he will raise us up , and we will live before him .
let us acknowledge Yahweh . let us press on to know Yahweh . as surely as the sun rises , Yahweh will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the earth . "
" Ephraim , what shall I do to you ? Judah , what shall I do to you ? for your love is like a morning cloud , and like the dew that disappears early .
therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets ; I killed them with the words of my mouth . your judgments are like a flash of lightning .
for I desire mercy , and not sacrifice ; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings .
but they , like Adam , have broken the Covenant . they were unfaithful to me , there .
Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity ; it is stained with blood .
as gangs of robbers wait to ambush a man , so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem , committing shameful crimes .
in the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing . there is prostitution in Ephraim . Israel is defiled .
" also , Judah , there is a harvest appointed for you , when I restore the fortunes of my people .
when I would heal Israel , then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered , also the wickedness of Samaria ; for they commit falsehood , and the thief enters in , and the gang of robbers ravages outside .
they don 't consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness . now their own deeds have engulfed them . they are before my face .
they make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
they are all adulterers . they are burning like an oven that the Baker stops stirring , from the kneading of the dough , until it is leavened .
on the day of our king , the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine . he joined his hand with mockers .
for they have prepared their heart like an oven , while they lie in wait . their Baker sleeps all the night . in the morning it burns as a flaming fire .
they are all hot as an oven , and devour their judges . all their kings have fallen . there is no one among them who calls to me .
Ephraim , he mixes himself among the nations . Ephraim is a pancake not turned over .
Strangers have devoured his strength , and he doesn 't realize it . indeed , gray hairs are here and there on him , and he doesn 't realize it .
the pride of Israel testifies to his face ; yet they haven 't returned to Yahweh their God , nor sought him , for all this .
" Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove , without understanding . they call to Egypt . they go to Assyria .
when they go , I will spread my net on them . I will bring them down like the birds of the sky . I will chastise them , as their Congregation has heard .
Woe to them ! for they have wandered from me . destruction to them ! for they have trespassed against me . though I would redeem them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
they haven 't cried to me with their heart , but they howl on their beds . they assemble themselves for grain and new wine . they turn away from me .
though I have taught and strengthened their arms , yet they plot evil against me .
" put the trumpet to your lips ! something like an eagle is over Yahweh 's house , because they have broken my Covenant , and rebelled against my law .
they cry to me , ' My God , we Israel acknowledge you ! '
Israel has cast off that which is good . the enemy will pursue him .
they have set up kings , but not by me . they have made princes , and I didn 't approve . of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols , that they may be cut off .
let Samaria throw out his calf idol ! my anger burns against them ! how long will it be until they are capable of purity ?
for this is even from Israel ! the workman made it , and it is no God ; indeed , the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces .
for they sow the wind , and they will reap the whirlwind . he has no standing grain . the stalk will yield no head . if it does yield , strangers will swallow it up .
Israel is swallowed up . now they are among the nations like a worthless thing .
for they have gone up to Assyria , like a wild donkey wandering alone . Ephraim has hired lovers for himself .
but although they sold themselves among the nations , I will now gather them ; and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones .
because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning , they became for him altars for sinning .
I wrote for him the many things of my law ; but they were regarded as a strange thing .
for Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces ; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities ; but I will send a fire on his cities , and it will devour its fortresses . "
Don 't rejoice , Israel , to jubilation like the nations ; for you were unfaithful to your God . you love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor .
the threshing floor and the winepress won 't feed them , and the new wine will fail her .
they won 't dwell in Yahweh 's land ; but Ephraim will return to Egypt , and they will eat unclean food in Assyria .
what will you do in the day of solemn assembly , and in the day of the feast of Yahweh ?
for , behold , they have gone away from destruction . Egypt will gather them up . Memphis will bury them . Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver . thorns will be in their tents .
a prophet watches over Ephraim with my God . a fowler 's snare is on all of his paths , and hostility in the house of his God .
they have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of Gibeah . he will remember their iniquity . he will punish them for their sins .
as for Ephraim , their glory will fly away like a bird . there will be no birth , none with child , and no conception .
though they bring up their children , yet I will bereave them , so that not a man shall be left . indeed , woe also to them when I depart from them !
I have seen Ephraim , like Tyre , planted in a pleasant place ; but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer .
give them--Yahweh what will you give ? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts .
" all their wickedness is in Gilgal ; for there I hated them . because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their princes are rebels .
Ephraim is struck . their root has dried up . they will bear no fruit . even though they bring forth , yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb . "
my God will cast them away , because they did not listen to him ; and they will be wanderers among the nations .
Israel is a luxuriant vine that puts forth his fruit . according to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars . as their land has prospered , they have adorned their sacred stones .
their heart is divided . now they will be found guilty . he will demolish their altars . he will destroy their sacred stones .
surely now they will say , " We have no king ; for we don 't fear Yahweh ; and the king , what can he do for us ? "
they make promises , swearing falsely in making covenants . therefore judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field .
it also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king . Ephraim will receive shame , and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel .
Samaria and her king float away , like a twig on the water .
" Israel , you have sinned from the days of Gibeah . there they remained . the battle against the children of iniquity doesn 't overtake them in Gibeah .
when it is my desire , I will chastise them ; and the nations will be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two transgressions .
Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh ; so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck . I will set a Rider on Ephraim . Judah will plow . Jacob will break his clods .
sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap according to kindness . break up your fallow ground ; for it is time to seek Yahweh , until he comes and rains righteousness on you .
you have plowed wickedness . you have reaped iniquity . you have eaten the fruit of lies , for you trusted in your way , in the multitude of your mighty men .
therefore a battle roar will arise among your people , and all your fortresses will be destroyed , as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle . the mother was dashed in pieces with her children .
so Bethel will do to you because of your great wickedness . at daybreak the king of Israel will be destroyed .
" when Israel was a child , then I loved him , and called my son out of Egypt .
they called to them , so they went from them . they sacrificed to the Baals , and burned incense to engraved images .
yet I taught Ephraim to walk . I took them by his arms ; but they didn 't know that I healed them .
I drew them with cords of a man , with ties of love ; and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks ; and I bent down to him and I fed him .
" they won 't return into the land of Egypt ; but the Assyrian will be their king , because they refused to repent .
the sword will fall on their cities , and will destroy the bars of their gates , and will put an end to their plans .
my people are determined to turn from me . though they call to the Most High , he certainly won 't exalt them .
I will not execute the fierceness of my anger . I will not return to destroy Ephraim : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the midst of you ; and I will not come in wrath .
they will walk after Yahweh , who will roar like a lion ; for he will roar , and the children will come trembling from the west .
they will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a dove out of the land of Assyria ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Yahweh .
Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood , and the house of Israel with deceit . Judah still strays from God , and is unfaithful to the Holy One .
Ephraim feeds on wind , and chases the east wind . he continually multiplies lies and desolation . they make a Covenant with Assyria , and oil is carried into Egypt .
Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah , and will punish Jacob according to his ways ; according to his deeds he will repay him .
in the womb he took his brother by the heel ; and in his manhood he contended with God .
indeed , he struggled with the angel , and prevailed ; he wept , and made supplication to him . he found him at Bethel , and there he spoke with us ,
therefore turn to your God . keep kindness and justice , and wait continually for your God .
a merchant has dishonest scales in his hand . he loves to defraud .
Ephraim said , " surely I have become rich , I have found myself wealth . in all my wealth they won 't find in me any iniquity that is sin . "
" but I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt . I will yet again make you dwell in tents , as in the days of the solemn feast .
I have also spoken to the prophets , and I have multiplied visions ; and by the ministry of the prophets I have used parables .
if Gilead is wicked , surely they are worthless . in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls . indeed , their altars are like heaps in the furrows of the field .
Jacob fled into the country of Aram , and Israel served to get a wife , and for a wife he tended flocks and herds .
by a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up out of Egypt , and by a prophet he was preserved .
Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger . therefore his blood will be left on him , and his Lord will repay his contempt .
when Ephraim spoke , there was trembling . he exalted himself in Israel , but when he became guilty in Baal , he died .
therefore they will be like the morning mist , and like the dew that passes away early , like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor , and like the smoke out of the chimney .
" yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt ; and you shall acknowledge no god but me , and besides me there is no Savior .
I knew you in the wilderness , in the land of great drought .
according to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was exalted . therefore they have forgotten me .
therefore I am like a lion to them . like a Leopard , I will lurk by the path .
I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs , and will tear the covering of their heart . there I will devour them like a lioness . the wild animal will tear them .
you are destroyed , Israel , because you are against me , against your help .
where is your king now , that he may save you in all your cities ? and your judges , of whom you said , ' Give me a king and princes ? '
I have given you a king in my anger , and have taken him away in my wrath .
the guilt of Ephraim is stored up . his sin is stored up .
the sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him . he is an unwise son ; for when it is time , he doesn 't come to the opening of the womb .
I will ransom them from the power of Sheol . I will redeem them from death ! death , where are your plagues ? Sheol , where is your destruction ? " compassion will be hidden from my eyes .
Samaria will bear her guilt ; for she has rebelled against her God . they will fall by the sword . their infants will be dashed in pieces , and their pregnant women will be ripped open . "
Israel , return to Yahweh your God ; for you have fallen because of your sin .
take words with you , and return to Yahweh . tell him , " Forgive all our sins , and accept that which is good : so we offer our lips like bulls .
Assyria can 't save us . we won 't ride on horses ; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands , ' Our gods ! ' for in you the fatherless finds mercy . "
" I will heal their waywardness . I will love them freely ; for my anger is turned away from him .
I will be like the dew to Israel . he will blossom like the Lily , and send down his roots like Lebanon .
his branches will spread , and his beauty will be like the olive tree , and his fragrance like Lebanon .
men will dwell in his shade . they will revive like the grain , and blossom like the vine . their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon .
Ephraim , what have I to do any more with idols ? I answer , and will take care of him . I am like a green fir tree ; from me your fruit is found . "
who is wise , that he may understand these things ? who is prudent , that he may know them ? for the ways of Yahweh are right , and the righteous walk in them ; But the rebellious stumble in them .
the Word of Yahweh that came to Joel , the son of Pethuel .
hear this , you elders , And listen , all you inhabitants of the land . has this ever happened in your days , or in the days of your fathers ?
tell your children about it , and have your children tell their children , and their children , another generation .
what the swarming locust has left , the great locust has eaten . what the great locust has left , the grasshopper has eaten . what the grasshopper has left , the caterpillar has eaten .
wake up , you drunkards , and weep ! Wail , all you drinkers of wine , because of the sweet wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
for a nation has come up on my land , strong , and without number . his teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he has the fangs of a lioness .
he has laid my vine waste , and stripped my fig tree . he has stripped its bark , and thrown it away . its branches are made white .
mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth !
the meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from Yahweh 's house . the priests , Yahweh 's ministers , mourn .
the field is laid waste . the land mourns , for the grain is destroyed , The new wine has dried up , and the oil languishes .
the vine has dried up , and the fig tree withered ; the pomegranate tree , the palm tree also , and the apple tree , even all of the trees of the field are withered ; for joy has withered away from the sons of men .
Sanctify a fast . call a solemn assembly . gather the elders , and all the inhabitants of the land , to the house of Yahweh , your God , and cry to Yahweh .
Alas for the day ! for the day of Yahweh is at hand , and it will come as destruction from the Almighty .
Isn 't the food cut off before our eyes ; joy and gladness from the house of our God ?
the seeds rot under their clods . the granaries are laid desolate . the barns are broken down , for the grain has withered .
how the animals groan ! the herds of livestock are perplexed , because they have no pasture . yes , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
Yahweh , I cry to you , For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame has burned all the trees of the field .
yes , the animals of the field pant to you , for the water brooks have dried up , And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
blow the trumpet in Zion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain ! let all the inhabitants of the land tremble , for the day of Yahweh comes , for it is close at hand :
a fire devours before them , and behind them , a flame burns . the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them , a desolate wilderness . yes , and no one has escaped them .
their appearance is as the appearance of horses , and as horsemen , so do they run .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
at their presence the peoples are in anguish . all faces have grown pale .
they run like mighty men . they climb the wall like warriors . they each march in his line , and they don 't swerve off course .
neither does one jostle another ; they march everyone in his path , and they burst through the defenses , and don 't break ranks .
they rush on the city . they run on the wall . they climb up into the houses . they enter in at the windows like thieves .
the earth quakes before them . the heavens tremble . the sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
Yahweh thunders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obeys his command ; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome , and who can endure it ?
" yet even now , " says Yahweh , " turn to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning . "
tear your heart , and not your garments , and turn to Yahweh , your God ; for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness , and relents from sending calamity .
who knows ? he may turn and relent , and leave a blessing behind him , even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh , your God .
blow the trumpet in Zion ! Sanctify a fast . call a solemn assembly .
gather the people . Sanctify the assembly . assemble the elders . gather the children , and those who nurse from breasts . let the bridegroom go forth from his room , and the bride out of her room .
then Yahweh was Jealous for his land , And had pity on his people .
Yahweh answered his people , " behold , I will send you grain , new wine , and oil , and you will be satisfied with them ; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations .
land , don 't be afraid . be glad and rejoice , for Yahweh has done great things .
Don 't be afraid , you animals of the field ; for the pastures of the wilderness spring up , for the tree bears its fruit . the fig tree and the vine yield their strength .
the threshing floors will be full of wheat , and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil .
I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten , the great locust , the grasshopper , and the caterpillar , my great army , which I sent among you .
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Yahweh , your God , who has dealt wondrously with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
you will know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am Yahweh , your God , and there is no one else ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
" it will happen afterward , that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters will prophesy . your old men will dream dreams . your young men will see visions .
and also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days , I will pour out my Spirit .
I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth : blood , fire , and pillars of smoke .
the sun will be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes .
" for , behold , in those days , and in that time , when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem ,
I will gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat ; and I will execute judgment on them there for my people , and for my heritage , Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations . they have divided my land ,
and have cast lots for my people , and have given a boy for a prostitute , and sold a girl for wine , that they may drink .
" yes , and what are you to me , Tyre , and Sidon , and all the regions of Philistia ? will you repay me ? and if you repay me , I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head .
because you have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried my finest treasures into your temples ,
and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks , that you may remove them far from their border .
behold , I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them , and will return your repayment on your own head ;
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah , and they will sell them to the men of Sheba , to a faraway nation , for Yahweh has spoken it . "
proclaim this among the nations : " prepare for war ! stir up the mighty men . let all the warriors draw near . let them come up .
beat your plowshares into swords , and your pruning hooks into spears . let the weak say , ' I am strong . '
hurry and come , all you surrounding nations , and gather yourselves together . " cause your mighty ones to come down there , Yahweh .
" let the nations arouse themselves , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat ; for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations .
put in the sickle ; for the harvest is ripe . come , tread , for the winepress is full , the vats overflow , for their wickedness is great . "
multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision ! for the day of Yahweh is near , in the valley of decision .
the sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
Yahweh will roar from Zion , and Thunder from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth will shake ; but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people , and a stronghold to the children of Israel .
" so you will know that I am Yahweh , your God , dwelling in Zion , my holy mountain . then Jerusalem will be holy , and no strangers will pass through her any more .
it will happen in that day , that the mountains will drop down sweet wine , the hills will flow with milk , all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters , and a fountain will come forth from the house of Yahweh , and will water the valley of Shittim .
Egypt will be a desolation , and Edom will be a desolate wilderness , for the violence done to the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
but Judah will be inhabited forever , and Jerusalem from generation to generation .
I will cleanse their blood , that I have not cleansed : for Yahweh dwells in Zion . "
he said : " Yahweh will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn , and the top of Carmel will wither . "
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Damascus , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron ;
but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael , and it will devour the palaces of Ben Hadad .
I will break the bar of Damascus , and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven , and him who holds the scepter from the house of Eden ; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir , " says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Gaza , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they carried away captive the whole community , to deliver them up to Edom ;
but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , and it will devour its palaces .
I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod , and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon ; and I will turn my hand against Ekron ; and the remnant of the Philistines will perish , " says the Lord Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Tyre , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they delivered up the whole community to Edom , and didn 't remember the brotherly Covenant ;
but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre , and it will devour its palaces . "
but I will send a fire on Teman , and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah . "
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of the children of Ammon , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead , that they may enlarge their border .
but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it will devour its palaces , with shouting in the day of battle , with a storm in the day of the whirlwind ;
and their king will go into captivity , he and his princes together , " says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Moab , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime ;
but I will send a fire on Moab , and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth ; and Moab will die with tumult , with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet ;
and I will cut off the judge from their midst , and will kill all its princes with him , " says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Judah , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have rejected Yahweh 's law , and have not kept his statutes , and their lies have led them astray , after which their fathers walked ;
but I will send a fire on Judah , and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem . "
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Israel , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have sold the righteous for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ;
they trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and deny justice to the oppressed ; and a man and his father use the same maiden , to profane my holy name ;
and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge ; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined .
yet I destroyed the Amorite before them , whose height was like the height of the cedars , and he was strong as the oaks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath .
also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and led you forty years in the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
I raised up some of your sons for prophets , and some of your young men for Nazirites . Isn 't this true , you children of Israel ? " says Yahweh .
" but you gave the Nazirites wine to drink , and commanded the prophets , saying , ' Don 't prophesy ! '
behold , I will crush you in your place , as a cart crushes that is full of grain .
flight will perish from the swift ; and the strong won 't strengthen his force ; neither shall the mighty deliver himself ;
neither shall he stand who handles the bow ; and he who is swift of foot won 't escape ; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself ;
and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked on that day , " says Yahweh .
hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you , children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt , saying :
" you only have I chosen of all the families of the earth . therefore I will punish you for all of your sins . "
do two walk together , unless they have agreed ?
will a lion roar in the thicket , when he has no prey ? does a young lion cry out of his den , if he has caught nothing ?
can a bird fall in a trap on the earth , where no snare is set for him ? does a snare spring up from the ground , when there is nothing to catch ?
does the trumpet alarm sound in a city , without the people being afraid ? does evil happen to a city , and Yahweh hasn 't done it ?
surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing , unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets .
the lion has roared . who will not fear ? the Lord Yahweh has spoken . who can but prophesy ?
proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , " assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria , and see what unrest is in her , and what oppression is among them . "
" indeed they don 't know to do right , " says Yahweh , " Who hoard plunder and loot in their palaces . "
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : " an adversary will overrun the land ; and he will pull down your strongholds , and your fortresses will be plundered . "
" listen , and testify against the house of Jacob , " says the Lord Yahweh , the God of Armies .
" for in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him , I will also visit the altars of Bethel ; and the horns of the altar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
I will strike the winter house with the summer house ; and the houses of Ivory will perish , and the great houses will have an end , " says Yahweh .
the Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness that behold , " The days shall come on you that they will take you away with hooks , and the last of you with fish hooks .
you will go out at the breaks in the wall , everyone straight before her ; and you will cast yourselves into Harmon , " says Yahweh .
" go to Bethel , and sin ; to Gilgal , and sin more . bring your sacrifices every morning , your tithes every three days ,
offer a sacrifice of Thanksgiving of that which is leavened , and proclaim free will offerings and brag about them : for this pleases you , you children of Israel , " says the Lord Yahweh .
" I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities , and lack of bread in every town ; yet you haven 't returned to me , " says Yahweh .
so two or three cities staggered to one city to drink water , and were not satisfied : yet you haven 't returned to me , " says Yahweh .
" I struck you with blight and mildew many times in your gardens and your vineyards ; and your fig trees and your olive trees have the swarming locust devoured : yet you haven 't returned to me , " says Yahweh .
" I have overthrown some of you , as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah , and you were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire ; yet you haven 't returned to me , " says Yahweh .
" therefore thus will I do to you , Israel ; because I will do this to you , prepare to meet your God , Israel .
listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you , O house of Israel .
" the virgin of Israel has fallen ; She shall rise no more . she is cast down on her land ; there is no one to raise her up . "
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : " the city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left , and that which went forth one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel . "
for thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel : " seek me , and you will live ;
seek Yahweh , and you will live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and it devour , and there be no one to quench it in Bethel .
you who turn justice to wormwood , and cast down righteousness to the earth :
seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion , and turns the shadow of death into the morning , and makes the day dark with night ; who calls for the waters of the sea , and pours them out on the surface of the earth , Yahweh is his name ,
who brings sudden destruction on the strong , so that destruction comes on the fortress .
they hate him who reproves in the gate , and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly .
Forasmuch therefore as you trample on the poor , and take taxes from him of wheat : you have built houses of cut stone , but you will not dwell in them . you have planted pleasant vineyards , but you shall not drink their wine .
for I know how many your offenses , and how great are your sins-- you who afflict the just , who take a bribe , and who turn aside the needy in the courts .
therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time , for it is an evil time .
seek good , and not evil , that you may live ; and so Yahweh , the God of Armies , will be with you , as you say .
hate evil , love good , and establish justice in the courts . it may be that Yahweh , the God of Armies , will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph . "
therefore thus says Yahweh , the God of Armies , the Lord : " wailing will be in all the broad ways ; and they will say in all the streets , ' Alas ! Alas ! ' and they will call the farmer to mourning , and those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing .
in all vineyards there will be wailing ; for I will pass through the midst of you , " says Yahweh .
" Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh ! why do you long for the day of Yahweh ? it is darkness , and not light .
as if a man fled from a lion , and a bear met him ; Or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall , and a snake bit him .
won 't the day of Yahweh be darkness , and not light ? even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
I hate , I despise your feasts , and I can 't stand your solemn assemblies .
yes , though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings , I will not accept them ; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals .
take away from me the noise of your songs ! I will not listen to the music of your harps .
but let justice roll on like rivers , and righteousness like a mighty stream .
" did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years , house of Israel ?
therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus , " says Yahweh , whose name is the God of Armies .
Woe to those who are at ease in Zion , and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samaria , the notable men of the chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel come !
go to Calneh , and see ; and from there go to Hamath the great ; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. are they better than these kingdoms ? or is their border greater than your border ?
those who put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
who lie on beds of Ivory , and stretch themselves on their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
who strum on the strings of a harp ; who invent for themselves instruments of music , like David ;
who drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the best oils ; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph .
therefore they will now go captive with the first who go captive ; and the feasting and lounging will end .
it will happen , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
" for , behold , Yahweh commands , and the great house will be smashed to pieces , and the little house into bits .
do horses run on the rocky crags ? does one plow there with oxen ? but you have turned justice into poison , and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness ;
you who rejoice in a thing of nothing , who say , ' haven 't we taken for ourselves horns by our own strength ? '
thus the Lord Yahweh showed me : and behold , he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and behold , it was the latter growth after the king 's harvest .
Yahweh relented concerning this . " it shall not be , " says Yahweh .
thus the Lord Yahweh showed me and behold , the Lord Yahweh called for judgment by fire ; and it dried up the great deep , and would have devoured the land .
then I said , " Lord Yahweh , stop , I beg you ! how could Jacob stand ? for he is small . "
Yahweh relented concerning this . " this also shall not be , " says the Lord Yahweh .
thus he showed me and behold , the Lord stood beside a wall made by a Plumb line , with a Plumb line in his hand .
the high places of Isaac will be desolate , the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste ; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword . "
then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying , " Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel . the land is not able to bear all his words .
for Amos says , ' Jeroboam will die by the sword , and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land . ' "
Amaziah also said to Amos , " You seer , go , flee away into the land of Judah , and there eat bread , and prophesy there :
but don 't prophesy again any more at Bethel ; for it is the king 's sanctuary , and it is a royal house ! "
then Amos answered Amaziah , " I was no prophet , neither was I a prophet 's son ; but I was a herdsman , and a farmer of sycamore figs ;
and Yahweh took me from following the flock , and Yahweh said to me , ' Go , prophesy to my people Israel . '
now therefore listen to the word of Yahweh : ' you say , Don 't prophesy against Israel , and don 't preach against the house of Isaac . '
thus the Lord Yahweh showed me : behold , a basket of summer fruit .
the songs of the temple will be wailings in that day , " says the Lord Yahweh . " the dead bodies will be many . in every place they will throw them out with silence .
hear this , you who desire to swallow up the needy , and cause the poor of the land to fail ,
that we may buy the poor for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes , and sell the sweepings with the wheat ? ' "
Yahweh has sworn by the pride of Jacob , " surely I will never forget any of their works .
won 't the land tremble for this , and everyone mourn who dwells in it ? yes , it will rise up wholly like the River ; and it will be stirred up and sink again , like the River of Egypt .
it will happen in that day , " says the Lord Yahweh , " that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will darken the earth in the clear day .
behold , the days come , " says the Lord Yahweh , " that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of Yahweh .
they will wander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east ; they will run back and forth to seek the word of Yahweh , and will not find it .
in that day the beautiful virgins and the young men will faint for thirst .
though they dig into Sheol , there my hand will take them ; and though they climb up to heaven , there I will bring them down .
though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel , I will search and take them out there ; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea , there I will command the serpent , and it will bite them .
though they go into captivity before their enemies , there I will command the sword , and it will kill them . I will set my eyes on them for evil , and not for good .
for the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , is he who touches the land and it melts , and all who dwell in it will mourn ; and it will rise up wholly like the River , and will sink again , like the River of Egypt .
it is he who builds his rooms in the heavens , and has founded his vault on the earth ; he who calls for the waters of the sea , and pours them out on the surface of the earth ; Yahweh is his name .
are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me , children of Israel ? " says Yahweh . " haven 't I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt , and the Philistines from Caphtor , and the Syrians from Kir ?
behold , the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom , and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth ; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob , " says Yahweh .
" for , behold , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations , as grain is sifted in a sieve , yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth .
all the sinners of my people will die by the sword , who say , ' Evil won 't overtake nor meet us . '
in that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen , and close up its breaches , and I will raise up its ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old ;
that they may possess the remnant of Edom , and all the nations who are called by my name , " says Yahweh who does this .
" behold , the days come , " says Yahweh , " that the plowman shall overtake the reaper , and the one treading grapes him who sows seed ; and sweet wine will drip from the mountains , and flow from the hills .
I will bring my people Israel back from captivity , and they will rebuild the ruined cities , and inhabit them ; and they will plant vineyards , and drink wine from them . they shall also make gardens , and eat their fruit .
I will plant them on their land , and they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them , " says Yahweh your God .
behold , I have made you small among the nations . you are greatly despised .
the pride of your heart has deceived you , you who dwell in the clefts of the rock , whose habitation is high , who says in his heart , ' Who will bring me down to the ground ? '
though you mount on high as the eagle , and though your nest is set among the stars , I will bring you down from there , " says Yahweh .
how Esau will be ransacked ! how his hidden treasures are sought out !
" won 't I in that day , " says Yahweh , " destroy the wise men out of Edom , and understanding out of the mountain of Esau ?
your mighty men , Teman , will be dismayed , to the end that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter .
for the violence done to your brother Jacob , shame will cover you , and you will be cut off forever .
but don 't look down on your brother in the day of his disaster , and don 't rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction . Don 't speak proudly in the day of distress .
Don 't enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity . Don 't look down on their affliction in the day of their calamity , neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity .
Don 't stand in the crossroads to cut off those of his who escape . Don 't deliver up those of his who remain in the day of distress .
for the day of Yahweh is near all the nations ! as you have done , it will be done to you . your deeds will return upon your own head .
for as you have drunk on my holy mountain , so will all the nations drink continually . yes , they will drink , swallow down , and will be as though they had not been .
but in Mount Zion , there will be those who escape , and it will be holy . the house of Jacob will possess their possessions .
the house of Jacob will be a fire , the house of Joseph a flame , and the house of Esau for stubble . they will burn among them , and devour them . there will not be any remaining to the house of Esau . " indeed , Yahweh has spoken .
Saviors will go up on Mount Zion to judge the mountains of Esau , and the kingdom will be Yahweh 's .
but Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea , and there was a mighty storm on the sea , so that the ship was likely to break up .
they all said to each other , " Come , let us cast lots , that we may know who is responsible for this evil that is on us . " so they cast lots , and the lot fell on Jonah .
he said to them , " I am a Hebrew , and I fear Yahweh , the God of heaven , who has made the sea and the dry land . "
then they said to him , " What shall we do to you , that the sea may be calm to us ? " for the sea grew more and more stormy .
he said to them , " Take me up , and throw me into the sea . then the sea will be calm for you ; for I know that because of me this great storm is on you . "
nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land ; but they could not , for the sea grew more and more stormy against them .
so they took up Jonah , and threw him into the sea ; and the sea ceased its raging .
then the men feared Yahweh exceedingly ; and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh , and made vows .
Yahweh prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah , and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights .
then Jonah prayed to Yahweh , his God , out of the fish 's belly .
he said , " I called because of my affliction to Yahweh . he answered me . out of the belly of Sheol I cried . you heard my voice .
for you threw me into the depths , in the heart of the seas . the flood was all around me . all your waves and your billows passed over me .
I said , ' I have been banished from your sight ; yet I will look again toward your holy temple . '
the waters surrounded me , even to the soul . the deep was around me . the weeds were wrapped around my head .
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains . the earth barred me in forever : yet have you brought up my life from the pit , Yahweh my God .
" when my soul fainted within me , I remembered Yahweh . my prayer came in to you , into your holy temple .
those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy .
but I will sacrifice to you with the voice of Thanksgiving . I will pay that which I have vowed . salvation belongs to Yahweh . "
Yahweh spoke to the fish , and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land .
the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the second time , saying ,
" arise , go to Nineveh , that great city , and preach to it the message that I give you . "
so Jonah arose , and went to Nineveh , according to the word of Yahweh . now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city , three days ' journey across .
Jonah began to enter into the city a day 's journey , and he cried out , and said , " In forty days , Nineveh will be overthrown ! "
the people of Nineveh believed God ; and they proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from their greatest even to their least .
the news reached the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and took off his royal robe , covered himself with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
but let them be covered with sackcloth , both man and animal , and let them cry mightily to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his evil way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
who knows whether God will not turn and relent , and turn away from his fierce anger , so that we might not perish ? "
God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way . God relented of the disaster which he said he would do to them , and he didn 't do it .
but it displeased Jonah exceedingly , and he was angry .
therefore now , Yahweh , take , I beg you , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live . "
Yahweh said , " Is it right for you to be angry ? "
then Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a booth , and sat under it in the shade , until he might see what would become of the city .
Yahweh God prepared a vine , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shade over his head , to deliver him from his discomfort . so Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the vine .
but God prepared a worm at dawn the next day , and it chewed on the vine , so that it withered .
God said to Jonah , " Is it right for you to be angry about the vine ? " he said , " I am right to be angry , even to death . "
Yahweh said , " You have been concerned for the vine , for which you have not labored , neither made it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night .
the word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
hear , you peoples , all of you . listen , O earth , and all that is therein : and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you , the Lord from his holy temple .
for , behold , Yahweh comes forth out of his place , and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth .
the mountains melt under him , and the valleys split apart , like wax before the fire , like waters that are poured down a steep place .
" all this is for the disobedience of Jacob , and for the sins of the house of Israel . what is the disobedience of Jacob ? Isn 't it Samaria ? and what are the high places of Judah ? Aren 't they Jerusalem ?
therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field , like places for planting vineyards ; and I will pour down its stones into the valley , and I will uncover its foundations .
all her idols will be beaten to pieces , and all her temple gifts will be burned with fire , and all her images I will destroy ; for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them , and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return . "
for this I will lament and wail ; I will go stripped and naked ; I will howl like the jackals , and moan like the daughters of owls .
for her wounds are incurable ; for it has come even to Judah . it reaches to the gate of my people , even to Jerusalem .
Don 't tell it in Gath . Don 't weep at all . at Beth Ophrah I have rolled myself in the dust .
pass on , inhabitant of Shaphir , in nakedness and shame . the inhabitant of Zaanan won 't come out . the wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection .
for the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good , because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem .
harness the chariot to the swift steed , inhabitant of Lachish . she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion ; For the transgressions of Israel were found in you .
therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath . the houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel .
I will yet bring to you , inhabitant of Mareshah . he who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam .
shave your heads , and cut off your hair for the children of your delight . enlarge your baldness like the vulture ; for they have gone into captivity from you !
Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds ! when the morning is light , they practice it , because it is in the power of their hand .
they covet fields , and seize them ; and houses , and take them away : and they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
therefore thus says Yahweh : " behold , I am planning against these people a disaster , from which you will not remove your necks , neither will you walk haughtily ; for it is an evil time .
therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in the assembly of Yahweh .
" Don 't prophesy ! " they prophesy . " Don 't prophesy about these things . disgrace won 't overtake us . "
but lately my people have risen up as an enemy . you strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care , returning from battle .
you drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses ; from their young children you take away my blessing forever .
arise , and depart ! for this is not your resting place , because of uncleanness that destroys , even with a grievous destruction .
if a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies : " I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink " ; he would be the prophet of this people .
he who breaks open the way goes up before them . they break through the gate , and go out . and their king passes on before them , with Yahweh at their head .
I said , " Please listen , you heads of Jacob , and rulers of the house of Israel : Isn 't it for you to know justice ?
you who hate the good , and love the evil ; who tear off their skin , and their flesh from off their bones ;
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them , and break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then they will cry to Yahweh , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their deeds evil . "
thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who lead my people astray ; for those who feed their teeth , they proclaim , " Peace ! " and whoever doesn 't provide for their mouths , they prepare war against him :
" therefore night is over you , with no vision , and it is dark to you , that you may not divine ; and the sun will go down on the prophets , and the day will be black over them .
the seers shall be disappointed , and the diviners confounded . yes , they shall all cover their lips ; for there is no answer from God . "
but as for me , I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh , and of judgment , and of might , to declare to Jacob his disobedience , and to Israel his sin .
please listen to this , you heads of the house of Jacob , and rulers of the house of Israel , who abhor justice , and pervert all equity .
they build up Zion with blood , and Jerusalem with iniquity .
therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field , and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble , and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest .
but in the latter days , it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh 's temple will be established on the top of the mountains , and it will be exalted above the hills ; and peoples will stream to it .
and he will judge between many peoples , and will decide concerning strong nations afar off . they will beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks . nation will not lift up sword against nation , neither will they learn war any more .
but they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and no one will make them afraid : for the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken .
indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods ; but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever .
" in that day , " says Yahweh , " I will assemble that which is lame , and I will gather that which is driven away , and that which I have afflicted ;
and I will make that which was lame a remnant , and that which was cast far off a strong nation : and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on , even forever . "
you , tower of the flock , the hill of the daughter of Zion , to you it will come , yes , the former dominion will come , the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem .
now why do you cry out aloud ? is there no king in you ? has your counselor perished , that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail ?
now many nations have assembled against you , that say , " Let her be defiled , and let our eye gloat over Zion . "
but they don 't know the thoughts of Yahweh , neither do they understand his counsel ; for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor .
now you shall gather yourself in troops , daughter of troops . he has laid siege against us . they will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek .
therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth . then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel .
he shall stand , and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh , in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God : and they will live , for then he will be great to the ends of the earth .
he will be our peace when Assyria invades our land , and when he marches through our fortresses , then we will raise against him seven shepherds , and eight leaders of men .
they will rule the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in its gates . he will deliver us from the Assyrian , when he invades our land , and when he marches within our border .
the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples , like dew from Yahweh , like showers on the grass , that don 't wait for man , nor wait for the sons of men .
let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries , and let all of your enemies be cut off .
" it will happen in that day , " says Yahweh , " That I will cut off your horses out of the midst of you , and will destroy your chariots .
I will cut off the cities of your land , and will tear down all your strongholds .
I will destroy witchcraft from your hand ; and you shall have no soothsayers .
I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out of your midst ; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands .
I will uproot your Asherim out of your midst ; and I will destroy your cities .
I will execute vengeance in anger , and wrath on the nations that didn 't listen . "
listen now to what Yahweh says : " arise , plead your case before the mountains , and let the hills hear what you have to say .
hear , you mountains , Yahweh 's controversy , and you enduring foundations of the earth ; for Yahweh has a controversy with his people , and he will contend with Israel .
my people , what have I done to you ? how have I burdened you ? answer me !
for I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage . I sent before you Moses , Aaron , and Miriam .
how shall I come before Yahweh , and bow myself before the exalted God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with calves a year old ?
will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams ? with tens of thousands of rivers of oil ? shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience ? the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and a short ephah that is accursed ?
shall I be pure with dishonest scales , and with a bag of deceitful weights ?
her rich men are full of violence , her inhabitants speak lies , and their tongue is deceitful in their speech .
therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound . I have made you desolate because of your sins .
you shall eat , but not be satisfied . your humiliation will be in your midst . you will store up , but not save ; and that which you save I will give up to the sword .
you will sow , but won 't reap . you will tread the olives , but won 't anoint yourself with oil ; and crush grapes , but won 't drink the wine .
the godly man has perished out of the earth , and there is no one upright among men . they all lie in wait for blood ; every man hunts his brother with a net .
the best of them is like a brier . the most upright is worse than a Thorn hedge . the day of your watchmen , even your visitation , has come ; now is the time of their confusion .
Don 't trust in a neighbor . Don 't put confidence in a friend . with the woman lying in your embrace , be careful of the words of your mouth !
for the son dishonors the father , the daughter rises up against her mother , the daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law ; a man 's enemies are the men of his own house .
but as for me , I will look to Yahweh . I will wait for the God of my salvation . my God will hear me .
Don 't rejoice against me , my enemy . when I fall , I will arise . when I sit in darkness , Yahweh will be a light to me .
I will bear the indignation of Yahweh , because I have sinned against him , until he pleads my case , and executes judgment for me . he will bring me forth to the light . I will see his righteousness .
a day to build your walls-- In that day , he will extend your boundary .
in that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt , and from Egypt even to the River , and from sea to sea , and mountain to mountain .
yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein , for the fruit of their doings .
" as in the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt , I will show them marvelous things . "
the nations will see and be ashamed of all their might . they will lay their hand on their mouth . their ears will be deaf .
they will lick the dust like a serpent . like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens . they will come with fear to Yahweh our God , and will be afraid because of you .
he will again have compassion on us . he will tread our iniquities under foot ; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
you will give truth to Jacob , and mercy to Abraham , as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old .
an oracle about Nineveh . the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite .
Yahweh is a Jealous God and avenges . Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath . Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries , and he maintains wrath against his enemies .
Yahweh is slow to anger , and great in power , and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished . Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
he rebukes the sea , and makes it dry , and dries up all the rivers . Bashan languishes , and Carmel ; and the flower of Lebanon languishes .
the mountains quake before him , and the hills melt away . the earth trembles at his presence , yes , the world , and all who dwell in it .
who can stand before his indignation ? who can endure the fierceness of his anger ? his wrath is poured out like fire , and the rocks are broken apart by him .
Yahweh is good , a stronghold in the day of trouble ; and he knows those who take refuge in him .
but with an overflowing flood , he will make a full end of her place , and will pursue his enemies into darkness .
what do you plot against Yahweh ? he will make a full end . affliction won 't rise up the second time .
for entangled like thorns , and drunken as with their drink , they are consumed utterly like dry stubble .
there is one gone forth out of you , who devises evil against Yahweh , who counsels wickedness .
thus says Yahweh : " though they be in full strength , and likewise many , even so they will be cut down , and he shall pass away . though I have afflicted you , I will afflict you no more .
now will I break his yoke from off you , and will burst your bonds apart . "
he who dashes in pieces has come up against you . keep the fortress ! watch the way ! strengthen your waist ! fortify your power mightily !
for Yahweh restores the excellency of Jacob , as the excellency of Israel ; for the destroyers have destroyed them , and ruined their vine branches .
the shield of his mighty men is made red . the valiant men are in scarlet . the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation , and the pine spears are brandished .
the chariots rage in the streets . they rush back and forth in the broad ways . their appearance is like torches . they run like the lightnings .
he summons his picked troops . they stumble on their way . they dash to its wall , and the protective shield is put in place .
the gates of the rivers are opened , and the palace is dissolved .
it is decreed : she is uncovered , she is carried away ; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves , beating on their breasts .
but Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water , yet they flee away . " stop ! stop ! " they cry , but no one looks back .
take the spoil of silver . take the spoil of gold , for there is no end of the store , the glory of all goodly furniture .
she is empty , void , and waste . the heart melts , the knees knock together , their bodies and faces have grown pale .
where is the den of the lions , and the feeding place of the young lions , where the lion and the lioness walked , the lion 's cubs , and no one made them afraid ?
the lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his caves with the kill , and his dens with prey .
Woe to the bloody city ! it is all full of lies and robbery . the prey doesn 't depart .
the noise of the whip , the noise of the rattling of wheels , prancing horses , and bounding chariots ,
the Horseman mounting , and the flashing sword , the glittering spear , and a multitude of slain , and a great heap of corpses , and there is no end of the bodies . they stumble on their bodies ,
because of the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring prostitute , the mistress of witchcraft , who sells nations through her prostitution , and families through her witchcraft .
" behold , I am against you , " says Yahweh of Armies , " and I will lift your skirts over your face . I will show the nations your nakedness , and the kingdoms your shame .
I will throw abominable Filth on you , and make you vile , and will set you a spectacle .
it will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you , and say , ' Nineveh is laid waste ! who will mourn for her ? ' where will I seek comforters for you ? "
are you better than No @-@ Amon , who was situated among the rivers , who had the waters around her ; whose rampart was the sea , and her wall was of the sea ?
Cush and Egypt were her Boundless strength . put and Libya were her helpers .
yet was she carried away . she went into captivity . her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets , and they cast lots for her honorable men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
you also will be drunken . you will be hidden . you also will seek a stronghold because of the enemy .
all your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first @-@ ripe figs : if they are shaken , they fall into the mouth of the eater .
behold , your troops in your midst are women . the gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies . the fire has devoured your bars .
draw water for the siege . strengthen your fortresses . go into the clay , and tread the mortar . make the brick kiln strong .
there the fire will devour you . the sword will cut you off . it will devour you like the grasshopper . multiply like grasshoppers . multiply like the locust .
you have increased your merchants more than the stars of the skies . the grasshopper strips , and flees away .
your guards are like the locusts , and your officials like the swarms of locusts , which settle on the walls on a cold day , but when the sun appears , they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
your shepherds slumber , king of Assyria . your nobles lie down . your people are scattered on the mountains , and there is no one to gather them .
there is no healing your wound , for your injury is fatal . all who hear the report of you clap their hands over you ; for who hasn 't felt your endless cruelty ?
the oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw .
Yahweh , how long will I cry , and you will not hear ? I cry out to you " Violence ! " and will you not save ?
why do you show me iniquity , and look at perversity ? for destruction and violence are before me . there is strife , and contention rises up .
therefore the law is paralyzed , and justice never goes forth ; for the wicked surround the righteous ; therefore justice goes forth perverted .
" look among the nations , watch , and wonder marvelously ; for I am working a work in your days , which you will not believe though it is told you .
for , behold , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , that march through the breadth of the earth , to possess dwelling places that are not theirs .
they are feared and dreaded . their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves .
their horses also are swifter than leopards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves . their horsemen press proudly on . yes , their horsemen come from afar . they fly as an eagle that hurries to devour .
all of them come for violence . their hordes face the desert . he gathers prisoners like sand .
yes , he scoffs at kings , and princes are a derision to him . he laughs at every stronghold , for he builds up an earthen ramp , and takes it .
then he sweeps by like the wind , and goes on . he is indeed guilty , whose strength is his god . "
and make men like the fish of the sea , like the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
he takes up all of them with the hook . he catches them in his net , and gathers them in his dragnet . therefore he rejoices and is glad .
therefore he sacrifices to his net , and burns incense to his dragnet , because by them his life is luxurious , and his food is good .
will he therefore continually empty his net , and kill the nations without mercy ?
I will stand at my watch , and set myself on the ramparts , and will look out to see what he will say to me , and what I will answer concerning my complaint .
Yahweh answered me , " Write the vision , and make it plain on tablets , that he who runs may read it .
for the vision is yet for the appointed time , and it hurries toward the end , and won 't prove false . though it takes time , wait for it ; because it will surely come . it won 't delay .
behold , his soul is puffed up . it is not upright in him , but the righteous will live by his faith .
yes , moreover , wine is treacherous . a haughty man who doesn 't stay at home , who enlarges his desire as Sheol , and he is like death , and can 't be satisfied , but gathers to himself all nations , and heaps to himself all peoples .
won 't your debtors rise up suddenly , and wake up those who make you tremble , and you will be their victim ?
because you have plundered many nations , all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you , because of men 's blood , and for the violence done to the land , to the city and to all who dwell in it .
Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the hand of evil !
you have devised shame to your house , by cutting off many peoples , and have sinned against your soul .
for the stone will cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it .
Woe to him who builds a town with blood , and establishes a city by iniquity !
behold , isn 't it of Yahweh of Armies that the peoples labor for the fire , and the nations weary themselves for vanity ?
for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh , as the waters cover the sea .
" Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink , pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk , so that you may gaze at their naked bodies !
but Yahweh is in his holy temple . let all the earth be silent before him ! "
a prayer of Habakkuk , the prophet , set to victorious music .
God came from Teman , the Holy One from Mount Paran . Selah . his glory covered the heavens , and his praise filled the earth .
his splendor is like the sunrise . rays shine from his hand , where his power is hidden .
plague went before him , and pestilence followed his feet .
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction . the dwellings of the land of Midian trembled .
was Yahweh displeased with the rivers ? was your anger against the rivers , or your wrath against the sea , that you rode on your horses , on your chariots of salvation ?
you uncovered your bow . you called for your sworn arrows . Selah . you split the earth with rivers .
the mountains saw you , and were afraid . the storm of waters passed by . the deep roared and lifted up its hands on high .
the sun and moon stood still in the sky , at the light of your arrows as they went , at the shining of your glittering spear .
you marched through the land in wrath . you threshed the nations in anger .
you went forth for the salvation of your people , for the salvation of your anointed . you crushed the head of the land of wickedness . you stripped them head to foot . Selah .
you pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears . they came as a whirlwind to scatter me , gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret .
you trampled the sea with your horses , churning mighty waters .
yet I will rejoice in Yahweh . I will be joyful in the God of my salvation !
Yahweh , the Lord , is my strength . he makes my feet like deer 's feet , and enables me to go in high places . for the music director , on my stringed instruments .
the word of Yahweh which came to Zephaniah , the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hezekiah , in the days of Josiah , the son of Amon , king of Judah .
I will utterly sweep away everything off of the surface of the earth , says Yahweh .
I will sweep away man and animal . I will sweep away the birds of the sky , the fish of the sea , and the heaps of rubble with the wicked . I will cut off man from the surface of the earth , says Yahweh .
be silent at the presence of the Lord Yahweh , for the day of Yahweh is at hand . for Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice . he has consecrated his guests .
it will happen in the day of Yahweh 's sacrifice , that I will punish the princes , the king 's sons , and all those who are clothed with foreign clothing .
in that day , I will punish all those who leap over the threshold , who fill their master 's house with violence and deceit .
in that day , says Yahweh , there will be the noise of a cry from the fish gate , a wailing from the second quarter , and a great crashing from the hills .
Wail , you inhabitants of Maktesh , for all the people of Canaan are undone ! all those who were loaded with silver are cut off .
their wealth will become a spoil , and their houses a desolation . yes , they will build houses , but won 't inhabit them . they will plant vineyards , but won 't drink their wine .
the great day of Yahweh is near . it is near , and hurries greatly , the voice of the day of Yahweh . the mighty man cries there bitterly .
that day is a day of wrath , a day of distress and anguish , a day of trouble and ruin , a day of darkness and gloom , a day of clouds and blackness ,
a day of the trumpet and alarm , against the fortified cities , and against the high battlements .
seek Yahweh , all you humble of the land , who have kept his ordinances . seek righteousness . seek humility . it may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh 's anger .
for Gaza will be forsaken , and Ashkelon a desolation . they will drive out Ashdod at noonday , and Ekron will be rooted up .
the sea coast will be pastures , with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks .
this they will have for their pride , because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Yahweh of Armies .
Yahweh will be awesome to them , for he will famish all the gods of the land . men will worship him , everyone from his place , even all the shores of the nations .
you Cushites also , you will be killed by my sword .
he will stretch out his hand against the north , destroy Assyria , and will make Nineveh a desolation , as dry as the wilderness .
Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted , the oppressing city !
she didn 't obey the voice . she didn 't receive correction . she didn 't trust in Yahweh . she didn 't draw near to her God .
her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions . her judges are evening wolves . they leave nothing until the next day .
her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people . her priests have profaned the sanctuary . they have done violence to the law .
for then I will purify the lips of the peoples , that they may all call on the name of Yahweh , to serve him shoulder to shoulder .
from beyond the rivers of Cush , my worshipers , even the daughter of my dispersed people , will bring my offering .
in that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings , in which you have transgressed against me ; for then I will take away out of the midst of you your proudly exulting ones , and you will no more be haughty in my holy mountain .
but I will leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people , and they will take refuge in the name of Yahweh .
the remnant of Israel will not do iniquity , nor speak lies , neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth , for they will feed and lie down , and no one will make them afraid . "
sing , daughter of Zion ! shout , Israel ! be glad and rejoice with all your heart , daughter of Jerusalem .
Yahweh has taken away your judgments . he has thrown out your enemy . the King of Israel , Yahweh , is in the midst of you . you will not be afraid of evil any more .
in that day , it will be said to Jerusalem , " Don 't be afraid , Zion . Don 't let your hands be weak . "
Yahweh , your God , is in the midst of you , a mighty one who will save . he will rejoice over you with joy . he will calm you in his love . he will rejoice over you with singing .
in the second year of Darius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai , the prophet , to Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua , the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , saying ,
" this is what Yahweh of Armies says : these people say , ' The time hasn 't yet come , the time for Yahweh 's house to be built . ' "
then the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai , the prophet , saying ,
" is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses , while this house lies waste ?
now therefore this is what Yahweh of Armies says : consider your ways .
therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew , and the earth Withholds its fruit .
I called for a drought on the land , on the mountains , on the grain , on the new wine , on the oil , on that which the ground brings forth , on men , on livestock , and on all the labor of the hands . "
then Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , and Joshua , the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , with all the remnant of the people , obeyed the voice of Yahweh , their God , and the words of Haggai , the prophet , as Yahweh , their God , had sent him ; and the people feared Yahweh .
then Haggai , Yahweh 's messenger , spoke Yahweh 's message to the people , saying , " I am with you , " says Yahweh .
in the seventh month , in the twenty @-@ first day of the month , the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet , saying ,
" speak now to Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua , the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and to the remnant of the people , saying ,
'Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory ? how do you see it now ? Isn 't it in your eyes as nothing ?
this is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt , and my Spirit lived among you . ' Don 't be afraid . '
for this is what Yahweh of Armies says : ' yet once , it is a little while , and I will shake the heavens , the earth , the sea , and the dry land ;
and I will shake all nations . the precious things of all nations will come , and I will fill this house with glory , says Yahweh of Armies .
the silver is mine , and the gold is mine , ' says Yahweh of Armies .
'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former , ' says Yahweh of Armies ; ' and in this place will I give peace , ' says Yahweh of Armies . "
in the twenty @-@ fourth day of the ninth month , in the second year of Darius , the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet , saying ,
" thus says Yahweh of Armies : ask now the priests concerning the law , saying ,
then Haggai answered , " ' So is this people , and so is this nation before me , ' says Yahweh ; ' and so is every work of their hands . that which they offer there is unclean .
I struck you with blight , mildew , and hail in all the work of your hands ; yet you didn 't turn to me , ' says Yahweh .
'Consider , please , from this day and backward , from the twenty @-@ fourth day of the ninth month , since the day that the foundation of Yahweh 's temple was laid , consider it .
is the seed yet in the barn ? yes , the vine , the fig tree , the pomegranate , and the olive tree haven 't brought forth . from this day will I bless you . ' "
the Word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the twenty @-@ fourth day of the month , saying ,
" speak to Zerubbabel , governor of Judah , saying , ' I will shake the heavens and the earth .
I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms . I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations . I will overthrow the chariots , and those who ride in them . the horses and their riders will come down , everyone by the sword of his brother .
in the eighth month , in the second year of Darius , the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , the prophet , saying ,
" Yahweh was very displeased with your fathers .
therefore tell them : thus says Yahweh of Armies : ' return to me , ' says Yahweh of Armies , ' and I will return to you , ' says Yahweh of Armies .
your fathers , where are they ? and the prophets , do they live forever ?
on the twenty @-@ fourth day of the eleventh month , which is the month Shebat , in the second year of Darius , the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , the prophet , saying ,
" I had a vision in the night , and behold , a man riding on a red horse , and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in a ravine ; and behind him there were red , brown , and white horses .
then I asked , ' My lord , what are these ? ' " the angel who talked with me said to me , " I will show you what these are . "
the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered , " They are the ones Yahweh has sent to go back and forth through the earth . "
they reported to the angel of Yahweh who stood among the myrtle trees , and said , " We have walked back and forth through the earth , and behold , all the earth is at rest and in peace . "
then the angel of Yahweh replied , " O Yahweh of Armies , how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah , against which you have had indignation these seventy years ? "
Yahweh answered the angel who talked with me with kind and comforting words .
so the angel who talked with me said to me , " proclaim , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies : " I am Jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy .
I am very angry with the nations that are at ease ; for I was but a little displeased , but they added to the calamity . "
" proclaim further , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies : " my cities will again overflow with prosperity , and Yahweh will again comfort Zion , and will again choose Jerusalem . " ' "
I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , four horns .
I asked the angel who talked with me , " What are these ? " he answered me , " These are the horns which have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem . "
I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , a man with a measuring line in his hand .
then I asked , " Where are you going ? " he said to me , " To measure Jerusalem , to see what is its breadth and what is its length . "
behold , the angel who talked with me went forth , and another angel went out to meet him ,
and said to him , " Run , speak to this young man , saying , ' Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls , because of the multitude of men and livestock in it .
for I , ' says Yahweh , ' will be to her a wall of fire around it , and I will be the glory in the midst of her .
come ! come ! flee from the land of the north , ' says Yahweh ; ' for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky , ' says Yahweh .
'Come , Zion ! escape , you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon . '
for thus says Yahweh of Armies : ' for honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you ; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye .
for , behold , I will shake my hand over them , and they will be a spoil to those who served them ; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me .
sing and rejoice , daughter of Zion ; for , behold , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of you , ' says Yahweh .
many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day , and shall be my people ; and I will dwell in the midst of you , and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you .
Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land , and will again choose Jerusalem .
be silent , all flesh , before Yahweh ; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation ! "
he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh , and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary .
now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments , and was standing before the angel .
he answered and spoke to those who stood before him , saying , " Take the filthy garments off of him . " to him he said , " behold , I have caused your iniquity to pass from you , and I will clothe you with rich clothing . "
I said , " Let them set a clean turban on his head . " so they set a clean turban on his head , and clothed him ; and the angel of Yahweh was standing by .
the angel of Yahweh protested to Joshua , saying ,
hear now , Joshua the high priest , you and your fellows who sit before you ; for they are men who are a sign : for , behold , I will bring forth my servant , the Branch .
in that day , ' says Yahweh of Armies , ' you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree . ' "
the angel who talked with me came again , and wakened me , as a man who is wakened out of his sleep .
and two olive trees by it , one on the right side of the bowl , and the other on the left side of it . "
I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me , saying , " What are these , my lord ? "
then the angel who talked with me answered me , " Don 't you know what these are ? " I said , " No , my lord . "
then he answered and spoke to me , saying , " This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel , saying , ' Not by might , nor by power , but by my Spirit , ' says Yahweh of Armies .
" the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house . his hands shall also finish it ; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you .
then I asked him , " What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it ? "
I asked him the second time , " What are these two olive branches , which are beside the two golden spouts , that pour the golden oil out of themselves ? "
he answered me , " Don 't you know what these are ? " I said , " No , my lord . "
then he said , " These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth . "
then again I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , a flying scroll .
he said to me , " What do you see ? " I answered , " I see a flying scroll ; its length is twenty cubits , and its breadth ten cubits . "
then the angel who talked with me came forward , and said to me , " Lift up now your eyes , and see what is this that is appearing . "
I said , " What is it ? " he said , " This is the ephah basket that is appearing . " he said moreover , " This is their appearance in all the land
( and behold , a talent of lead was lifted up ) ; and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah basket . "
he said , " This is Wickedness " ; and he threw her down into the midst of the ephah basket ; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth .
then lifted I up my eyes , and saw , and behold , there were two women , and the wind was in their wings . now they had wings like the wings of a stork , and they lifted up the ephah basket between earth and the sky .
then I said to the angel who talked with me , " Where are these carrying the ephah basket ? "
he said to me , " To build her a house in the land of Shinar . when it is prepared , she will be set there in her own place . "
again I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , four chariots came out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of brass .
in the first chariot were red horses ; in the second chariot black horses ;
in the third chariot white horses ; and in the fourth chariot dappled horses , all of them powerful .
the angel answered me , " These are the four winds of the sky , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
the one with the black horses goes out toward the north country ; and the white went out after them ; and the dappled went forth toward the south country . "
the strong went out , and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth : and he said , " Go around and through the earth ! " so they walked back and forth through the earth .
then he called to me , and spoke to me , saying , " behold , those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country . "
the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
" take of them of the captivity , even of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah ; and come the same day , and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah , where they have come from Babylon .
yes , take silver and gold , and make crowns , and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest ;
and speak to him , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " behold , the man whose name is the Branch : and he shall grow up out of his place ; and he shall build Yahweh 's temple ;
even he shall build Yahweh 's temple ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule on his throne ; and he shall be a priest on his throne ; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
the crowns shall be to Helem , and to Tobijah , and to Jedaiah , and to Hen the son of Zephaniah , for a memorial in Yahweh 's temple .
it happened in the fourth year of king Darius that the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month , the month of Chislev .
" speak to all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , ' When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month for these seventy years , did you at all fast to me , really to me ?
when you eat , and when you drink , don 't you eat for yourselves , and drink for yourselves ?
" thus has Yahweh of Armies spoken , saying , ' execute true judgment , and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother .
Don 't oppress the widow , nor the fatherless , the foreigner , nor the poor ; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart . '
but they refused to listen , and turned their backs , and stopped their ears , that they might not hear .
it has come to pass that , as he called , and they refused to listen , so they will call , and I will not listen , " said Yahweh of Armies ;
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " I am Jealous for Zion with great jealousy , and I am Jealous for her with great wrath . "
thus says Yahweh : " I have returned to Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem . Jerusalem shall be called ' The City of Truth ; ' and the mountain of Yahweh of Armies , ' The Holy Mountain . ' "
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " if it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days , should it also be marvelous in my eyes ? " says Yahweh of Armies .
for before those days there was no wages for man , nor any wages for an animal ; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in , because of the adversary . for I set all men everyone against his neighbor .
but now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" for the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit , and the ground will give its increase , and the heavens will give their dew ; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things .
it shall come to pass that , as you were a curse among the nations , house of Judah and house of Israel , so will I save you , and you shall be a blessing . Don 't be afraid . let your hands be strong . "
for thus says Yahweh of Armies : " as I thought to do evil to you , when your fathers provoked me to wrath , " says Yahweh of Armies , " and I didn 't repent ;
so again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah . Don 't be afraid .
these are the things that you shall do : speak every man the truth with his neighbor . execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates ,
and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor , and love no false oath : for all these are things that I hate , " says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " the fasts of the fourth fifth , seventh , and tenth months shall be for the house of Judah joy and gladness , and cheerful feasts . therefore love truth and peace . "
thus says Yahweh of Armies : " many peoples , and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come ;
and the inhabitants of one shall go to another , saying , ' Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Yahweh , and to seek Yahweh of Armies . I will go also . '
yes , many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Yahweh of Armies in Jerusalem , and to entreat the favor of Yahweh . "
an oracle . the word of Yahweh is against the land of Hadrach , and will rest upon Damascus ; for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh ;
and Hamath , also , which borders on it ; Tyre and Sidon , because they are very wise .
tyre built herself a stronghold , and heaped up silver like the dust , and fine gold like the mire of the streets .
behold , the Lord will dispossess her , and he will strike her power in the sea ; and she will be devoured with fire .
Ashkelon will see it , and fear ; Gaza also , and will writhe in agony ; as will Ekron , for her expectation will be disappointed ; and the king will perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon will not be inhabited .
foreigners will dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines .
I will encamp around my house against the army , that none pass through or return ; and no oppressor will pass through them any more : for now I have seen with my eyes .
as for you also , because of the blood of your Covenant , I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water .
turn to the stronghold , you prisoners of hope ! even today I declare that I will restore double to you .
for indeed I bend Judah as a bow for me . I have filled the bow with Ephraim ; and I will stir up your sons , Zion , against your sons , Greece , and will make you like the sword of a mighty man .
Yahweh will be seen over them ; and his arrow will go flash like lightning ; and the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet , and will go with whirlwinds of the south .
Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people ; for they are like the jewels of a crown , lifted on high over his land .
for how great is his Goodness , and how great is his beauty ! grain will make the young men flourish , and new wine the virgins .
ask of Yahweh rain in the spring time , Yahweh who makes storm clouds , and he gives rain showers to everyone for the plants in the field .
my anger is kindled against the shepherds , and I will punish the male goats ; For Yahweh of Armies has visited his flock , the house of Judah , and will make them as his majestic horse in the battle .
from him will come forth the cornerstone , from him the nail , from him the battle bow , from him every ruler together .
they shall be as mighty men , treading down muddy streets in the battle ; and they shall fight , because Yahweh is with them ; and the riders on horses will be confounded .
" I will strengthen the house of Judah , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them back ; for I have mercy on them ; and they will be as though I had not cast them off : for I am Yahweh their God , and I will hear them .
Ephraim will be like a mighty man , and their heart will rejoice as through wine ; yes , their children will see it , and rejoice . their heart will be glad in Yahweh .
I will signal for them , and gather them ; for I have redeemed them ; and they will increase as they have increased .
I will sow them among the peoples ; and they will remember me in far countries ; and they will live with their children , and will return .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon ; and there won 't be room enough for them .
he will pass through the sea of affliction , and will strike the waves in the sea , and all the depths of the Nile will dry up ; and the pride of Assyria will be brought down , and the scepter of Egypt will depart .
I will strengthen them in Yahweh ; and they will walk up and down in his name , " says Yahweh .
open your doors , Lebanon , that the fire may devour your cedars .
Wail , fir tree , for the cedar has fallen , because the stately ones are destroyed . Wail , you oaks of Bashan , for the strong forest has come down .
a voice of the wailing of the shepherds ! for their glory is destroyed : a voice of the roaring of young lions ! for the pride of the Jordan is ruined .
thus says Yahweh my God : " feed the flock of slaughter .
for I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land , " says Yahweh ; " but , behold , I will deliver the men everyone into his neighbor 's hand , and into the hand of his king . they will strike the land , and out of their hand I will not deliver them . "
so I fed the flock of slaughter , especially the oppressed of the flock . I took for myself two staffs . the one I called " favor , " and the other I called " Union , " and I fed the flock .
I cut off the three shepherds in one month ; for my soul was weary of them , and their soul also loathed me .
then I said , " I will not feed you . that which dies , let it die ; and that which is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let those who are left eat each other 's flesh . "
I took my staff favor , and cut it apart , that I might break my Covenant that I had made with all the peoples .
it was broken in that day ; and thus the poor of the flock that listened to me knew that it was the word of Yahweh .
I said to them , " If you think it best , give me my wages ; and if not , keep them . " so they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver .
Yahweh said to me , " throw it to the Potter , the handsome price that I was valued at by them ! " I took the thirty pieces of silver , and threw them to the Potter , in the house of Yahweh .
then I cut apart my other staff , even Union , that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel .
Yahweh said to me , " Take for yourself yet again the equipment of a foolish shepherd .
Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock ! the sword will be on his arm , and on his right eye . his arm will be completely withered , and his right eye will be totally blinded ! "
an oracle . the word of Yahweh concerning Israel . Yahweh , who stretches out the heavens , and lays the foundation of the earth , and forms the spirit of man within him says :
" behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples , and on Judah also will it be in the siege against Jerusalem .
it will happen in that day , that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples . all who burden themselves with it will be severely wounded , and all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it .
in that day , " says Yahweh , " I will strike every horse with terror , and his Rider with madness ; and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah , and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness .
the chieftains of Judah will say in their heart , ' The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of Armies their God . '
Yahweh also will save the tents of Judah first , that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem not be magnified above Judah .
in that day Yahweh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem . he who is feeble among them at that day will be like David , and the house of David will be like God , like the angel of Yahweh before them .
it will happen in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
in that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem , like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon .
" in that day there will be a spring opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , for sin and for uncleanness .
it will come to pass in that day , says Yahweh of Armies , that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land , and they will be remembered no more . I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land .
it will happen in that day , that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision , when he prophesies ; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive :
but he will say , ' I am no prophet , I am a tiller of the ground ; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth . '
it shall happen that in all the land , " says Yahweh , " two parts in it will be cut off and die ; but the third will be left in it .
behold , a day of Yahweh comes , when your spoil will be divided in your midst .
then Yahweh will go out and fight against those nations , as when he fought in the day of battle .
it will happen in that day , that there will not be light , cold , or Frost .
it will be a unique day which is known to Yahweh ; not day , and not night ; but it will come to pass , that at evening time there will be light .
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
Yahweh will be King over all the earth . in that day Yahweh will be one , and his name one .
men will dwell therein , and there will be no more curse ; but Jerusalem will dwell safely .
this will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem : their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet , and their eyes will consume away in their sockets , and their tongue will consume away in their mouth .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor .
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together : gold , and silver , and clothing , in great abundance .
so will be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the Camel , and of the donkey , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that plague .
it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , and to keep the feast of tents .
it will be , that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn 't go up to Jerusalem to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , on them there will be no rain .
this will be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all the nations that don 't go up to keep the feast of tents .
in that day there will be on the bells of the horses , " Holy TO YAHWEH " ; and the pots in Yahweh 's house will be like the bowls before the altar .
an oracle : the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi .
but Esau I hated , and made his mountains a desolation , and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness . "
your eyes will see , and you will say , " Yahweh is great--even beyond the border of Israel ! "
you offer polluted bread on my altar . you say , ' How have we polluted you ? ' in that you say , ' Yahweh 's table contemptible . '
" now , please entreat the favor of God , that he may be gracious to us . with this , will he accept any of you ? " says Yahweh of Armies .
" but you profane it , in that you say , ' Yahweh 's table is polluted , and its fruit , even its food , is contemptible . '
" now , you priests , this commandment is for you .
behold , I will rebuke your seed , and will spread Dung on your faces , even the Dung of your feasts ; and you will be taken away with it .
you will know that I have sent this commandment to you , that my Covenant may be with Levi , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" my Covenant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me ; and he was reverent toward me , and stood in awe of my name .
for the priest 's lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth ; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies .
but you have turned aside out of the way . you have caused many to stumble in the law . you have corrupted the Covenant of Levi , " says Yahweh of Armies .
Don 't we all have one father ? Hasn 't one God created us ? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother , profaning the Covenant of our fathers ?
Judah has dealt treacherously , and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves , and has married the daughter of a foreign god .
Yahweh will cut off , to the man who does this , him who wakes and him who answers , out of the tents of Jacob , and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies .
yet you say , ' Why ? ' because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth , against whom you have dealt treacherously , though she is your companion , and the wife of your Covenant .
" behold , I send my messenger , and he will prepare the way before me ; and the Lord , whom you seek , will suddenly come to his temple ; and the messenger of the Covenant , whom you desire , behold , he comes ! " says Yahweh of Armies .
" but who can endure the day of his coming ? and who will stand when he appears ? for he is like a refiner 's fire , and like launderer 's soap ;
and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver , and he will purify the sons of Levi , and refine them as gold and silver ; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness .
then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Yahweh , as in the days of old , and as in ancient years .
" for I , Yahweh , don 't change ; therefore you , sons of Jacob , are not consumed .
will a man rob God ? yet you rob me ! but you say , ' How have we robbed you ? ' in tithes and offerings .
you are Cursed with the curse ; for you rob me , even this whole nation .
I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes , and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground ; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" all nations shall call you blessed , for you will be a delightful land , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" your words have been stout against me , " says Yahweh . " yet you say , ' What have we spoken against you ? '
now we call the proud happy ; yes , those who work wickedness are built up ; yes , they tempt God , and escape . '
then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another ; and Yahweh listened , and heard , and a book of memory was written before him , for those who feared Yahweh , and who honored his name .
then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him who serves God and him who doesn 't serve him .
but to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings . you will go out , and leap like calves of the stall .
you shall tread down the wicked ; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" remember the law of Moses my servant , which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel , even statutes and ordinances .
behold , I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes .
he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the hearts of the children to their fathers , lest I come and strike the earth with a curse . "
Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar . Perez became the father of Hezron . Hezron became the father of Ram .
ram became the father of Amminadab . Amminadab became the father of Nahshon . Nahshon became the father of salmon .
salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab . Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth . Obed became the father of Jesse .
Jesse became the father of King David . David became the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah .
Solomon became the father of Rehoboam . Rehoboam became the father of Abijah . Abijah became the father of ASA .
ASA became the father of Jehoshaphat . Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram . Joram became the father of Uzziah .
Uzziah became the father of Jotham . Jotham became the father of Ahaz . Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah .
Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh . Manasseh became the father of Amon . Amon became the father of Josiah .
Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers , at the time of the exile to Babylon .
after the exile to Babylon , Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel . Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel .
Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud . Abiud became the father of Eliakim . Eliakim became the father of Azor .
Azor became the father of Sadoc . Sadoc became the father of Achim . Achim became the father of Eliud .
Eliud became the father of Eleazar . Eleazar became the father of Matthan . Matthan became the father of Jacob .
Jacob became the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary , from whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ , fourteen generations .
now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this ; for after his mother , Mary , was engaged to Joseph , before they came together , she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit .
Joseph , her husband , being a righteous man , and not willing to make her a public example , intended to put her away secretly .
she shall bring forth a son . you shall call his name Jesus , for it is he who shall save his people from their sins . "
now all this has happened , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying ,
" behold , the virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son . they shall call his name Immanuel " ; which is , being interpreted , " God with us . "
Joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took his wife to himself ;
and didn 't know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son . he named him Jesus .
when King Herod heard it , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he asked them where the Christ would be born .
they said to him , " In Bethlehem of Judea , for this is written through the prophet ,
'You Bethlehem , land of Judah , are in no way least among the princes of Judah : for out of you shall come forth a governor , who shall shepherd my people , Israel . ' "
then Herod secretly called the wise men , and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared .
he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , " Go and search diligently for the young child . when you have found him , bring me word , so that I also may come and worship him . "
they , having heard the king , went their way ; and behold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .
when they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy .
they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary , his mother , and they fell down and worshiped him . opening their treasures , they offered to him gifts : gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
being warned in a dream that they shouldn 't return to Herod , they went back to their own country another way .
he arose and took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt ,
and was there until the death of Herod ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , " Out of Egypt I called my son . "
then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled , saying ,
" a voice was heard in Ramah , lamentation , weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children ; she wouldn 't be comforted , because they are no more . "
he arose and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
but when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father , Herod , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Galilee ,
and came and lived in a city called Nazareth ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets : " he will be called a Nazarene . "
in those days , John the Baptizer came , preaching in the wilderness of Judea , saying ,
for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet , saying , " The voice of one crying in the wilderness , make ready the way of the Lord . make his paths straight . "
now John himself wore clothing made of Camel 's hair , with a leather belt around his waist . his food was locusts and wild honey .
then people from Jerusalem , all of Judea , and all the region around the Jordan went out to him .
but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism , he said to them , " You offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance !
Don 't think to yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father , ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones .
" even now the axe lies at the root of the trees . therefore every tree that doesn 't bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
I indeed baptize you in water for repentance , but he who comes after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to carry . he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit .
his winnowing fork is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor . he will gather his wheat into the barn , but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire . "
then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John , to be baptized by him .
but John would have hindered him , saying , " I need to be baptized by you , and you come to me ? "
Jesus , when he was baptized , went up directly from the water : and behold , the heavens were opened to him . he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming on him .
behold , a voice out of the heavens said , " This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . "
then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil .
when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was hungry afterward .
the tempter came and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , command that these stones become bread . "
but he answered , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God . ' "
Jesus said to him , " Again , it is written , ' You shall not test the Lord , your God . ' "
again , the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world , and their glory .
he said to him , " I will give you all of these things , if you will fall down and worship me . "
then Jesus said to him , " Get behind me , Satan ! for it is written , ' You shall worship the Lord your God , and you shall serve him only . ' "
then the devil left him , and behold , angels came and served him .
now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up , he withdrew into Galilee .
leaving Nazareth , he came and lived in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
the people who sat in darkness saw a great light , to those who sat in the region and shadow of death , to them light has dawned . "
from that time , Jesus began to preach , and to say , " repent ! for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand . "
walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers : Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew , his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fishermen .
he said to them , " Come after me , and I will make you fishers for men . "
they immediately left their nets and followed him .
going on from there , he saw two other brothers , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets . he called them .
they immediately left the boat and their father , and followed him .
Jesus went about in all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , preaching the Good News of the Kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
the report about him went out into all Syria . they brought to him all who were sick , afflicted with various diseases and torments , possessed with demons , epileptics , and paralytics ; and he healed them .
great multitudes from Galilee , Decapolis , Jerusalem , Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him .
seeing the multitudes , he went up onto the mountain . when he had sat down , his disciples came to him .
he opened his mouth and taught them , saying ,
" blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven .
blessed are those who mourn , for they shall be comforted .
blessed are the gentle , for they shall inherit the earth .
blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness , for they shall be filled .
blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy .
blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God .
blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called children of God .
blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness ' sake , for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven .
" blessed are you when people reproach you , persecute you , and say all kinds of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
rejoice , and be exceedingly glad , for great is your reward in heaven . for that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
" you are the salt of the earth , but if the salt has lost its flavor , with what will it be salted ? it is then good for nothing , but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men .
you are the light of the world . a city located on a hill can 't be hidden .
neither do you light a lamp , and put it under a measuring basket , but on a stand ; and it shines to all who are in the house .
even so , let your light shine before men ; that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in heaven .
" Don 't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets . I didn 't come to destroy , but to fulfill .
for most certainly , I tell you , until heaven and earth pass away , not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law , until all things are accomplished .
for I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
" you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones , ' You shall not murder ; ' and ' Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment . '
agree with your adversary quickly , while you are with him in the way ; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge , and the judge deliver you to the officer , and you be cast into prison .
most certainly I tell you , you shall by no means get out of there , until you have paid the last penny .
but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart .
if your right eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish , than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna .
if your right hand causes you to stumble , cut it off , and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish , than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna .
" it was also said , ' Whoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorce , '
but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife , except for the cause of sexual immorality , makes her an adulteress ; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery .
" again you have heard that it was said to them of old time , ' You shall not make false vows , but shall perform to the Lord your vows , '
neither shall you swear by your head , for you can 't make one hair white or black .
but let your ' Yes ' be ' Yes ' and your ' No ' be ' No . ' whatever is more than these is of the evil one .
" you have heard that it was said , ' An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . '
but I tell you , don 't resist him who is evil ; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek , turn to him the other also .
if anyone sues you to take away your coat , let him have your cloak also .
whoever compels you to go one mile , go with him two .
give to him who asks you , and don 't turn away him who desires to borrow from you .
" you have heard that it was said , ' You shall love your neighbor , and hate your enemy . '
but I tell you , love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you ,
that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven . for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good , and sends rain on the just and the unjust .
for if you love those who love you , what reward do you have ? Don 't even the tax collectors do the same ?
if you only greet your friends , what more do you do than others ? Don 't even the tax collectors do the same ?
therefore you shall be perfect , just as your Father in heaven is perfect .
" be careful that you don 't do your charitable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven .
but when you do merciful deeds , don 't let your left hand know what your right hand does ,
so that your merciful deeds may be in secret , then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly .
but you , when you pray , enter into your inner room , and having shut your door , pray to your Father who is in secret , and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly .
in praying , don 't use vain repetitions , as the Gentiles do ; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking .
therefore don 't be like them , for your Father knows what things you need , before you ask him .
pray like this : ' our Father in heaven , may your name be kept holy .
let your Kingdom come . let your will be done , as in heaven , so on earth .
give us today our daily bread .
forgive us our debts , as we also forgive our debtors .
bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . for yours is the Kingdom , the power , and the glory forever . Amen . '
" for if you forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
but if you don 't forgive men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
" moreover when you fast , don 't be like the hypocrites , with sad faces . for they disfigure their faces , that they may be seen by men to be fasting . most certainly I tell you , they have received their reward .
but you , when you fast , anoint your head , and wash your face ;
so that you are not seen by men to be fasting , but by your Father who is in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
" Don 't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal ;
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust consume , and where thieves don 't break through and steal ;
for where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
" the lamp of the body is the eye . if therefore your eye is sound , your whole body will be full of light .
but if your eye is evil , your whole body will be full of darkness . if therefore the light that is in you is darkness , how great is the darkness !
see the birds of the sky , that they don 't sow , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns . your heavenly Father feeds them . Aren 't you of much more value than they ?
" which of you , by being anxious , can add one moment to his lifespan ?
why are you anxious about clothing ? consider the lilies of the field , how they grow . they don 't toil , neither do they spin ,
yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these .
but if God so clothes the grass of the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , won 't he much more clothe you , you of little faith ?
" therefore don 't be anxious , saying , ' What will we eat ? ' , ' What will we drink ? ' or , ' With what will we be clothed ? '
for the Gentiles seek after all these things ; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things .
but seek first God 's Kingdom , and his righteousness ; and all these things will be given to you as well .
therefore don 't be anxious for tomorrow , for tomorrow will be anxious for itself . each day 's own evil is sufficient .
" Don 't judge , so that you won 't be judged .
for with whatever judgment you judge , you will be judged ; and with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you .
why do you see the speck that is in your brother 's eye , but don 't consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
or how will you tell your brother , ' Let me remove the speck from your eye ; ' and behold , the beam is in your own eye ?
you hypocrite ! first remove the beam out of your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother 's eye .
" Don 't give that which is holy to the dogs , neither throw your pearls before the pigs , lest perhaps they trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .
" ask , and it will be given you . seek , and you will find . knock , and it will be opened for you .
for everyone who asks receives . he who seeks finds . to him who knocks it will be opened .
or who is there among you , who , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
or if he asks for a fish , who will give him a serpent ?
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you , you shall also do to them ; for this is the law and the prophets .
" enter in by the narrow gate ; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction , and many are those who enter in by it .
how narrow is the gate , and restricted is the way that leads to life ! few are those who find it .
" beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep 's clothing , but inwardly are ravening wolves .
by their fruits you will know them . do you gather grapes from thorns , or figs from thistles ?
even so , every good tree produces good fruit ; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit .
a good tree can 't produce evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit .
every tree that doesn 't grow good fruit is cut down , and thrown into the fire .
therefore by their fruits you will know them .
not everyone who says to me , ' Lord , Lord , ' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven ; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
then I will tell them , ' I never knew you . depart from me , you who work iniquity . '
" everyone therefore who hears these words of mine , and does them , I will liken him to a wise man , who built his house on a rock .
the rain came down , the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat on that house ; and it didn 't fall , for it was founded on the rock .
everyone who hears these words of mine , and doesn 't do them will be like a foolish man , who built his house on the sand .
the rain came down , the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat on that house ; and it fell--and great was its fall . "
it happened , when Jesus had finished saying these things , that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching ,
for he taught them with authority , and not like the scribes .
when he came down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
behold , a leper came to him and worshiped him , saying , " Lord , if you want to , you can make me clean . "
Jesus stretched out his hand , and touched him , saying , " I want to . be made clean . " immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
Jesus said to him , " I will come and heal him . "
the centurion answered , " Lord , I 'm not worthy for you to come under my roof . just say the word , and my servant will be healed .
when Jesus heard it , he marveled , and said to those who followed , " Most certainly I tell you , I haven 't found so great a faith , not even in Israel .
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west , and will sit down with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven ,
but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness . there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . "
Jesus said to the centurion , " Go your way . let it be done for you as you have believed . " his servant was healed in that hour .
when Jesus came into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother lying sick with a fever .
he touched her hand , and the fever left her . she got up and served him .
when evening came , they brought to him many possessed with demons . he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were sick ;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying : " he took our infirmities , and bore our diseases . "
now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him , he gave the order to depart to the other side .
a scribe came , and said to him , " Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go . "
Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head . "
another of his disciples said to him , " Lord , allow me first to go and bury my father . "
but Jesus said to him , " Follow me , and leave the dead to bury their own dead . "
when he got into a boat , his disciples followed him .
behold , a violent storm came up on the sea , so much that the boat was covered with the waves , but he was asleep .
they came to him , and woke him up , saying , " Save us , Lord ! we are dying ! "
he said to them , " Why are you fearful , O you of little faith ? " then he got up , rebuked the wind and the sea , and there was a great calm .
the men marveled , saying , " What kind of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? "
when he came to the other side , into the country of the Gergesenes , two people possessed by demons met him there , coming out of the tombs , exceedingly fierce , so that nobody could pass that way .
behold , they cried out , saying , " What do we have to do with you , Jesus , Son of God ? have you come here to torment us before the time ? "
now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them .
the demons begged him , saying , " If you cast us out , permit us to go away into the herd of pigs . "
he said to them , " Go ! " they came out , and went into the herd of pigs : and behold , the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea , and died in the water .
those who fed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , including what happened to those who were possessed with demons .
behold , all the city came out to meet Jesus . when they saw him , they begged that he would depart from their borders .
he entered into a boat , and crossed over , and came into his own city .
behold , they brought to him a man who was paralyzed , lying on a bed . Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paralytic , " Son , cheer up ! your sins are forgiven you . "
behold , some of the scribes said to themselves , " This man blasphemes . "
Jesus , knowing their thoughts , said , " Why do you think evil in your hearts ?
for which is easier , to say , ' Your sins are forgiven ; ' or to say , ' Get up , and walk ? '
but that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ... " ( then he said to the paralytic ) , " Get up , and take up your Mat , and go up to your house . "
he arose and departed to his house .
but when the multitudes saw it , they marveled and glorified God , who had given such authority to men .
as Jesus passed by from there , he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office . he said to him , " Follow me . " he got up and followed him .
it happened as he sat in the house , behold , many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples .
when the Pharisees saw it , they said to his disciples , " Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? "
when Jesus heard it , he said to them , " Those who are healthy have no need for a physician , but those who are sick do .
but you go and learn what this means : ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' for I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . "
then John 's disciples came to him , saying , " Why do we and the Pharisees fast often , but your disciples don 't fast ? "
Jesus said to them , " Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
no one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment ; for the patch would tear away from the garment , and a worse hole is made .
Jesus got up and followed him , as did his disciples .
behold , a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him , and touched the fringe of his garment ;
for she said within herself , " If I just touch his garment , I will be made well . "
but Jesus , turning around and seeing her , said , " Daughter , cheer up ! your faith has made you well . " and the woman was made well from that hour .
but when the crowd was put out , he entered in , took her by the hand , and the girl arose .
the report of this went out into all that land .
as Jesus passed by from there , two blind men followed him , calling out and saying , " Have mercy on us , son of David ! "
then he touched their eyes , saying , " According to your faith be it done to you . "
their eyes were opened . Jesus strictly commanded them , saying , " See that no one knows about this . "
but they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land .
as they went out , behold , a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him .
when the demon was cast out , the mute man spoke . the multitudes marveled , saying , " Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel ! "
but the Pharisees said , " By the prince of the demons , he casts out demons . "
Jesus went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion for them , because they were harassed and scattered , like sheep without a shepherd .
then he said to his disciples , " The harvest indeed is plentiful , but the laborers are few .
pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest . "
he called to himself his twelve disciples , and gave them authority over unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal every disease and every sickness .
Jesus sent these twelve out , and commanded them , saying , " Don 't go among the Gentiles , and don 't enter into any city of the Samaritans .
as you go , preach , saying , ' The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand ! '
heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , and cast out demons . freely you received , so freely give .
Don 't take any gold , nor silver , nor brass in your money belts .
take no bag for your journey , neither two coats , nor shoes , nor staff : for the laborer is worthy of his food .
into whatever city or village you enter , find out who in it is worthy ; and stay there until you go on .
if the household is worthy , let your peace come on it , but if it isn 't worthy , let your peace return to you .
whoever doesn 't receive you , nor hear your words , as you go out of that house or that city , shake off the dust from your feet .
most certainly I tell you , it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city .
" behold , I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves . therefore be wise as Serpents , and harmless as doves .
but beware of men : for they will deliver you up to councils , and in their synagogues they will scourge you .
yes , and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the nations .
but when they deliver you up , don 't be anxious how or what you will say , for it will be given you in that hour what you will say .
for it is not you who speak , but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
you will be hated by all men for my name 's sake , but he who endures to the end will be saved .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
" a disciple is not above his teacher , nor a servant above his lord .
it is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher , and the servant like his lord . if they have called the master of the house Beelzebul , how much more those of his household !
therefore don 't be afraid of them , for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed ; and hidden that will not be known .
what I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear whispered in the ear , proclaim on the housetops .
Don 't be afraid of those who kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul . rather , fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna .
" Aren 't two sparrows sold for an assarion coin ? not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father 's will ,
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
therefore don 't be afraid . you are of more value than many sparrows .
everyone therefore who confesses me before men , him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven .
but whoever denies me before men , him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven .
" Don 't think that I came to send peace on the earth . I didn 't come to send peace , but a sword .
for I came to set a man at odds against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
a man 's foes will be those of his own household .
he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn 't worthy of me .
he who doesn 't take his cross and follow after me , isn 't worthy of me .
he who seeks his life will lose it ; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it .
he who receives you receives me , and he who receives me receives him who sent me .
he who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet 's reward . he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man 's reward .
whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple , most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward . "
it happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples , he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities .
Jesus answered them , " Go and tell John the things which you hear and see :
the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have good news preached to them .
blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me . "
as these went their way , Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? a Reed shaken by the wind ?
but what did you go out to see ? a man in soft clothing ? behold , those who wear soft clothing are in king 's houses .
but why did you go out ? to see a prophet ? yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet .
for this is he , of whom it is written , ' behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
most certainly I tell you , among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer ; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he .
from the days of John the Baptizer until now , the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence , and the violent take it by force .
for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John .
if you are willing to receive it , this is Elijah , who is to come .
he who has ears to hear , let him hear .
" but to what shall I compare this generation ? it is like children sitting in the marketplaces , who call to their companions
for John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ' He has a demon . '
but I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
you , Capernaum , who are exalted to heaven , you will go down to Hades . for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .
but I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom , on the day of judgment , than for you . "
at that time , Jesus answered , " I thank you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that you hid these things from the wise and understanding , and revealed them to infants .
yes , Father , for so it was well @-@ pleasing in your sight .
all things have been delivered to me by my Father . no one knows the Son , except the Father ; neither does anyone know the Father , except the Son , and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him .
" come to me , all you who labor and are heavily burdened , and I will give you rest .
take my yoke upon you , and learn from me , for I am gentle and lowly in heart ; and you will find rest for your souls .
for my yoke is easy , and my burden is light . "
at that time , Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields . his disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat .
but the Pharisees , when they saw it , said to him , " behold , your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath . "
but he said to them , " haven 't you read what David did , when he was hungry , and those who were with him ;
how he entered into God 's house , and ate the show bread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
or have you not read in the law , that on the Sabbath day , the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath , and are guiltless ?
but I tell you that one greater than the temple is here .
but if you had known what this means , ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' you would not have condemned the guiltless .
for the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath . "
he departed there , and went into their synagogue .
and behold there was a man with a withered hand . they asked him , " Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day ? " that they might accuse him .
he said to them , " What man is there among you , who has one sheep , and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day , won 't he grab on to it , and lift it out ?
of how much more value then is a man than a sheep ! therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day . "
then he told the man , " Stretch out your hand . " he stretched it out ; and it was restored whole , just like the other .
but the Pharisees went out , and conspired against him , how they might destroy him .
Jesus , perceiving that , withdrew from there . great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them all ,
and commanded them that they should not make him known :
he will not strive , nor shout ; neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets .
he won 't break a bruised Reed . he won 't quench a smoking flax , until he leads justice to victory .
in his name , the nations will hope . "
then one possessed by a demon , blind and mute , was brought to him and he healed him , so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw .
all the multitudes were amazed , and said , " Can this be the son of David ? "
but when the Pharisees heard it , they said , " This man does not cast out demons , except by Beelzebul , the prince of the demons . "
knowing their thoughts , Jesus said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation , and every city or house divided against itself will not stand .
if Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . how then will his kingdom stand ?
if I by Beelzebul cast out demons , by whom do your children cast them out ? therefore they will be your judges .
but if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons , then the Kingdom of God has come upon you .
or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and plunder his goods , unless he first bind the strong man ? then he will plunder his house .
" he who is not with me is against me , and he who doesn 't gather with me , scatters .
therefore I tell you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men , but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men .
whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
" either make the tree good , and its fruit good , or make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt ; for the tree is known by its fruit .
you offspring of vipers , how can you , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth speaks .
the good man out of his good treasure brings out good things , and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things .
I tell you that every idle word that men speak , they will give account of it in the day of judgment .
for by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned . "
then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered , " Teacher , we want to see a sign from you . "
but he answered them , " An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , but no sign will be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet .
the men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation , and will condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , someone greater than Jonah is here .
but the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passes through waterless places , seeking rest , and doesn 't find it .
then he says , ' I will return into my house from which I came out , ' and when he has come back , he finds it empty , swept , and put in order .
then he goes , and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is , and they enter in and dwell there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . even so will it be also to this evil generation . "
while he was yet speaking to the multitudes , behold , his mother and his brothers stood outside , seeking to speak to him .
one said to him , " behold , your mother and your brothers stand outside , seeking to speak to you . "
but he answered him who spoke to him , " Who is my mother ? who are my brothers ? "
he stretched out his hand towards his disciples , and said , " behold , my mother and my brothers !
for whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven , he is my brother , and sister , and mother . "
on that day Jesus went out of the house , and sat by the seaside .
great multitudes gathered to him , so that he entered into a boat , and sat , and all the multitude stood on the beach .
he spoke to them many things in parables , saying , " behold , a farmer went out to sow .
as he sowed , some seeds fell by the roadside , and the birds came and devoured them .
others fell on rocky ground , where they didn 't have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , because they had no depth of earth .
when the sun had risen , they were scorched . because they had no root , they withered away .
others fell among thorns . the thorns grew up and choked them .
others fell on good soil , and yielded fruit : some one hundred times as much , some sixty , and some thirty .
he who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
the disciples came , and said to him , " Why do you speak to them in parables ? "
he answered them , " To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven , but it is not given to them .
for whoever has , to him will be given , and he will have abundance , but whoever doesn 't have , from him will be taken away even that which he has .
therefore I speak to them in parables , because seeing they don 't see , and hearing , they don 't hear , neither do they understand .
in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled , which says , ' By hearing you will hear , and will in no way understand ; seeing you will see , and will in no way perceive :
for this people 's heart has grown callous , their ears are dull of hearing , they have closed their eyes ; or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes , hear with their ears , understand with their heart , and should turn again ; and I would heal them . '
" but blessed are your eyes , for they see ; and your ears , for they hear .
for most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them .
when anyone hears the word of the Kingdom , and doesn 't understand it , the evil one comes , and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart . this is what was sown by the roadside .
what was sown among the thorns , this is he who hears the word , but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
what was sown on the good ground , this is he who hears the word , and understands it , who most certainly bears fruit , and brings forth , some one hundred times as much , some sixty , and some thirty . "
he set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field ,
but while people slept , his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also among the wheat , and went away .
but when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit , then the darnel weeds appeared also .
the servants of the householder came and said to him , ' Sir , didn 't you sow good seed in your field ? where did this darnel come from ? '
" he said to them , ' An enemy has done this . ' " the servants asked him , ' Do you want us to go and gather them up ? '
" but he said , ' No , lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds , you root up the wheat with them .
let both grow together until the harvest , and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers , " First , gather up the darnel weeds , and bind them in bundles to burn them ; but gather the wheat into my barn . " ' "
he set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field ;
which indeed is smaller than all seeds . but when it is grown , it is greater than the herbs , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches . "
he spoke another parable to them . " the Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , until it was all leavened . "
Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes ; and without a parable , he didn 't speak to them ,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying , " I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world . "
then Jesus sent the multitudes away , and went into the house . his disciples came to him , saying , " explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field . "
he answered them , " He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man ,
the field is the world ; and the good seed , these are the children of the Kingdom ; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one .
the enemy who sowed them is the devil . the harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are angels .
as therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire ; so will it be at the end of this age .
then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father . he who has ears to hear , let him hear .
" again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field , which a man found , and hid . in his joy , he goes and sells all that he has , and buys that field .
" again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls ,
who having found one pearl of great price , he went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
" again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet , that was cast into the sea , and gathered some fish of every kind ,
which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . they sat down , and gathered the good into containers , but the bad they threw away .
Jesus said to them , " Have you understood all these things ? " they answered him , " Yes , Lord . "
it happened that when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed from there .
Isn 't this the carpenter 's son ? Isn 't his mother called Mary , and his brothers , James , Joses , Simon , and Judas ?
Aren 't all of his sisters with us ? where then did this man get all of these things ? "
they were offended by him . but Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and in his own house . "
he didn 't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
for Herod had laid hold of John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife .
for John said to him , " It is not lawful for you to have her . "
when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
but when Herod 's birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod .
she , being prompted by her mother , said , " Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer . "
the king was grieved , but for the sake of his oaths , and of those who sat at the table with him , he commanded it to be given ,
and he sent and beheaded John in the prison .
his head was brought on a platter , and given to the young lady : and she brought it to her mother .
his disciples came , and took the body , and buried it ; and they went and told Jesus .
now when Jesus heard this , he withdrew from there in a boat , to a deserted place apart . when the multitudes heard it , they followed him on foot from the cities .
Jesus went out , and he saw a great multitude . he had compassion on them , and healed their sick .
when evening had come , his disciples came to him , saying , " This place is deserted , and the hour is already late . send the multitudes away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves food . "
but Jesus said to them , " They don 't need to go away . you give them something to eat . "
they told him , " We only have here five loaves and two fish . "
he said , " Bring them here to me . "
he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass ; and he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , broke and gave the loaves to the disciples , and the disciples gave to the multitudes .
they all ate , and were filled . they took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces .
those who ate were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead of him to the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
after he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into the mountain by himself to pray . when evening had come , he was there alone .
but the boat was now in the middle of the sea , distressed by the waves , for the wind was contrary .
in the fourth watch of the night , Jesus came to them , walking on the sea .
when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , " It 's a ghost ! " and they cried out for fear .
but immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying " cheer up ! it is I ! Don 't be afraid . "
Peter answered him and said , " Lord , if it is you , command me to come to you on the waters . "
he said , " Come ! " Peter stepped down from the boat , and walked on the waters to come to Jesus .
but when he saw that the wind was strong , he was afraid , and beginning to sink , he cried out , saying , " Lord , save me ! "
immediately Jesus stretched out his hand , took hold of him , and said to him , " You of little faith , why did you doubt ? "
when they got up into the boat , the wind ceased .
those who were in the boat came and worshiped him , saying , " You are truly the Son of God ! "
when they had crossed over , they came to the land of Gennesaret .
when the people of that place recognized him , they sent into all that surrounding region , and brought to him all who were sick ,
and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment . as many as touched it were made whole .
he answered them , " Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition ?
for God commanded , ' honor your father and your mother , ' and , ' He who speaks evil of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
you hypocrites ! well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying ,
and in vain do they worship me , teaching as doctrine rules made by men . ' "
he summoned the multitude , and said to them , " Hear , and understand .
that which enters into the mouth doesn 't defile the man ; but that which proceeds out of the mouth , this defiles the man . "
then the disciples came , and said to him , " Do you know that the Pharisees were offended , when they heard this saying ? "
but he answered , " Every plant which my heavenly Father didn 't plant will be uprooted .
leave them alone . they are blind guides of the blind . if the blind guide the blind , both will fall into a pit . "
Peter answered him , " explain the parable to us . "
so Jesus said , " Do you also still not understand ?
Don 't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly , and then out of the body ?
but the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart , and they defile the man .
for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , sexual sins , thefts , false testimony , and blasphemies .
these are the things which defile the man ; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn 't defile the man . "
Jesus went out from there , and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon .
but he answered her not a word . his disciples came and begged him , saying , " Send her away ; for she cries after us . "
but he answered , " I wasn 't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel . "
but she came and worshiped him , saying , " Lord , help me . "
but he answered , " It is not appropriate to take the children 's bread and throw it to the dogs . "
but she said , " Yes , Lord , but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters ' table . "
then Jesus answered her , " Woman , great is your faith ! be it done to you even as you desire . " and her daughter was healed from that hour .
Jesus departed there , and came near to the sea of Galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
great multitudes came to him , having with them the lame , blind , mute , maimed , and many others , and they put them down at his feet . he healed them ,
so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking , injured whole , lame walking , and blind seeing--and they glorified the God of Israel .
the disciples said to him , " Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude ? "
Jesus said to them , " How many loaves do you have ? " they said , " Seven , and a few small fish . "
he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground ;
and he took the seven loaves and the fish . he gave thanks and broke them , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
they all ate , and were filled . they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
those who ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .
then he sent away the multitudes , got into the boat , and came into the borders of Magdala .
the Pharisees and Sadducees came , and testing him , asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
but he answered them , " When it is evening , you say , ' It will be fair weather , for the sky is red . '
in the morning , ' It will be foul weather today , for the sky is red and threatening . ' hypocrites ! you know how to discern the appearance of the sky , but you can 't discern the signs of the times !
an evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and there will be no sign given to it , except the sign of the prophet Jonah . " he left them , and departed .
the disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread .
Jesus said to them , " Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
they reasoned among themselves , saying , " We brought no bread . "
Jesus , perceiving it , said , " Why do you reason among yourselves , you of little faith , ' because you have brought no bread ? '
how is it that you don 't perceive that I didn 't speak to you concerning bread ? but beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
then they understood that he didn 't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , " Who do men say that I , the Son of Man , am ? "
they said , " Some say John the Baptizer , some , Elijah , and others , Jeremiah , or one of the prophets . "
Simon Peter answered , " You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
Jesus answered him , " blessed are you , Simon Bar Jonah , for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you , but my Father who is in heaven .
I also tell you that you are Peter , and on this rock I will build my assembly , and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it .
I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven , and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven ; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven . "
then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ .
from that time , Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
Peter took him aside , and began to rebuke him , saying , " Far be it from you , Lord ! this will never be done to you . "
but he turned , and said to Peter , " Get behind me , Satan ! you are a stumbling block to me , for you are not setting your mind on the things of God , but on the things of men . "
then Jesus said to his disciples , " If anyone desires to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever desires to save his life will lose it , and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it .
for what will it profit a man , if he gains the whole world , and forfeits his life ? or what will a man give in exchange for his life ?
for the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels , and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds .
most certainly I tell you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death , until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom . "
after six days , Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John his brother , and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves .
he was transfigured before them . his face shone like the sun , and his garments became as white as the light .
behold , Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him .
Peter answered , and said to Jesus , " Lord , it is good for us to be here . if you want , let 's make three tents here : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
while he was still speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them . behold , a voice came out of the cloud , saying , " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . listen to him . "
when the disciples heard it , they fell on their faces , and were very afraid .
Jesus came and touched them and said , " Get up , and don 't be afraid . "
lifting up their eyes , they saw no one , except Jesus alone .
as they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , " Don 't tell anyone what you saw , until the Son of Man has risen from the dead . "
his disciples asked him , saying , " Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? "
Jesus answered them , " Elijah indeed comes first , and will restore all things ,
but I tell you that Elijah has come already , and they didn 't recognize him , but did to him whatever they wanted to . even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them . "
then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer .
when they came to the multitude , a man came to him , kneeling down to him , saying ,
" Lord , have mercy on my son , for he is epileptic , and suffers grievously ; for he often falls into the fire , and often into the water .
so I brought him to your disciples , and they could not cure him . "
Jesus answered , " Faithless and perverse generation ! how long will I be with you ? how long will I bear with you ? bring him here to me . "
Jesus rebuked him , the demon went out of him , and the boy was cured from that hour .
then the disciples came to Jesus privately , and said , " Why weren 't we able to cast it out ? "
when they had come to Capernaum , those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter , and said , " Doesn 't your teacher pay the didrachma ? "
Peter said to him , " From strangers . " Jesus said to him , " Therefore the children are exempt .
in that hour the disciples came to Jesus , saying , " Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven ? "
whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child , the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven .
whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me ,
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck , and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea .
" Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling ! for it must be that the occasions come , but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes !
if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off , and cast it from you . it is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire .
if your eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out , and cast it from you . it is better for you to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire .
see that you don 't despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven .
" what do you think ? if a man has one hundred sheep , and one of them goes astray , doesn 't he leave the ninety @-@ nine , go to the mountains , and seek that which has gone astray ?
if he finds it , most certainly I tell you , he rejoices over it more than over the ninety @-@ nine which have not gone astray .
even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish .
" if your brother sins against you , go , show him his fault between you and him alone . if he listens to you , you have gained back your brother .
but if he doesn 't listen , take one or two more with you , that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
if he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the assembly . if he refuses to hear the assembly also , let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector .
most certainly I tell you , whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven , and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven .
again , assuredly I tell you , that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask , it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven .
for where two or three are gathered together in my name , there I am in their midst . "
then Peter came and said to him , " Lord , how often shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? until seven times ? "
Jesus said to him , " I don 't tell you until seven times , but , until seventy times seven .
therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king , who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants .
when he had begun to reconcile , one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents .
but because he couldn 't pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , with his wife , his children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
the servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him , saying , ' Lord , have patience with me , and I will repay you all ! '
the lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt .
" but that servant went out , and found one of his fellow servants , who owed him one hundred denarii , and he grabbed him , and took him by the throat , saying , ' Pay me what you owe ! '
" so his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him , saying , ' Have patience with me , and I will repay you ! '
he would not , but went and cast him into prison , until he should pay back that which was due .
so when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were exceedingly sorry , and came and told to their lord all that was done .
then his lord called him in , and said to him , ' You wicked servant ! I forgave you all that debt , because you begged me .
Shouldn 't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant , even as I had mercy on you ? '
his lord was angry , and delivered him to the tormentors , until he should pay all that was due to him .
so my heavenly Father will also do to you , if you don 't each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds . "
it happened when Jesus had finished these words , he departed from Galilee , and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan .
great multitudes followed him , and he healed them there .
Pharisees came to him , testing him , and saying , " Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason ? "
so that they are no more two , but one flesh . what therefore God has joined together , don 't let man tear apart . "
they asked him , " Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce , and divorce her ? "
he said to them , " Moses , because of the hardness of your hearts , allowed you to divorce your wives , but from the beginning it has not been so .
I tell you that whoever divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , and marries another , commits adultery ; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery . "
his disciples said to him , " If this is the case of the man with his wife , it is not expedient to marry . "
but he said to them , " Not all men can receive this saying , but those to whom it is given .
for there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother 's womb , and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men ; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven 's sake . he who is able to receive it , let him receive it . "
he laid his hands on them , and departed from there .
behold , one came to him and said , " Good teacher , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ? "
he said to him , " Why do you call me good ? no one is good but one , that is , God . but if you want to enter into life , keep the commandments . "
the young man said to him , " All these things I have observed from my youth . what do I still lack ? "
Jesus said to him , " If you want to be perfect , go , sell what you have , and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . "
but when the young man heard the saying , he went away sad , for he was one who had great possessions .
Jesus said to his disciples , " Most certainly I say to you , a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty .
again I tell you , it is easier for a Camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
when the disciples heard it , they were exceedingly astonished , saying , " Who then can be saved ? "
looking at them , Jesus said , " With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . "
then Peter answered , " behold , we have left everything , and followed you . what then will we have ? "
everyone who has left houses , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , will receive one hundred times , and will inherit eternal life .
but many will be last who are first ; and first who are last .
" for the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the marketplace .
about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing idle . he said to them , ' Why do you stand here all day idle ? '
" they said to him , ' Because no one has hired us . ' " he said to them , ' You also go into the vineyard , and you will receive whatever is right . '
when evening had come , the lord of the vineyard said to his manager , ' Call the laborers and pay them their wages , beginning from the last to the first . '
" when those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came , they each received a denarius .
when the first came , they supposed that they would receive more ; and they likewise each received a denarius .
when they received it , they murmured against the master of the household ,
saying , ' These last have spent one hour , and you have made them equal to us , who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat ! '
" but he answered one of them , ' friend , I am doing you no wrong . Didn 't you agree with me for a denarius ?
take that which is yours , and go your way . it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you .
Isn 't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own ? or is your eye evil , because I am good ? '
so the last will be first , and the first last . for many are called , but few are chosen . "
and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock , to scourge , and to crucify ; and the third day he will be raised up . "
then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons , kneeling and asking a certain thing of him .
he said to her , " What do you want ? " she said to him , " Command that these , my two sons , may sit , one on your right hand , and one on your left hand , in your Kingdom . "
but Jesus answered , " You don 't know what you are asking . are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? " they said to him , " We are able . "
when the ten heard it , they were indignant with the two brothers .
but Jesus summoned them , and said , " You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
it shall not be so among you , but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant .
whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant ,
even as the Son of Man came not to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . "
as they went out from Jericho , a great multitude followed him .
behold , two blind men sitting by the road , when they heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out , " Lord , have mercy on us , you son of David ! "
the multitude rebuked them , telling them that they should be quiet , but they cried out even more , " Lord , have mercy on us , you son of David ! "
Jesus stood still , and called them , and asked , " What do you want me to do for you ? "
they told him , " Lord , that our eyes may be opened . "
Jesus , being moved with compassion , touched their eyes ; and immediately their eyes received their sight , and they followed him .
if anyone says anything to you , you shall say , ' The Lord needs them , ' and immediately he will send them . "
all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
" tell the daughter of Zion , behold , your King comes to you , humble , and riding on a donkey , on a colt , the foal of a donkey . "
the disciples went , and did just as Jesus commanded them ,
and brought the donkey and the colt , and laid their clothes on them ; and he sat on them .
a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road . others cut branches from the trees , and spread them on the road .
the multitudes who went before him , and who followed kept shouting , " Hosanna to the son of David ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
when he had come into Jerusalem , all the city was stirred up , saying , " Who is this ? "
the multitudes said , " This is the prophet , Jesus , from Nazareth of Galilee . "
Jesus entered into the temple of God , and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the money changers ' tables and the seats of those who sold the doves .
he said to them , " It is written , ' My house shall be called a house of prayer , ' but you have made it a den of robbers ! "
the blind and the lame came to him in the temple , and he healed them .
but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children who were crying in the temple and saying , " Hosanna to the son of David ! " they were indignant ,
he left them , and went out of the city to Bethany , and lodged there .
now in the morning , as he returned to the city , he was hungry .
when the disciples saw it , they marveled , saying , " How did the fig tree immediately wither away ? "
all things , whatever you ask in prayer , believing , you will receive . "
when he had come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching , and said , " By what authority do you do these things ? who gave you this authority ? "
Jesus answered them , " I also will ask you one question , which if you tell me , I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
the baptism of John , where was it from ? from heaven or from men ? " they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will ask us , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
but if we say , ' From men , ' we fear the multitude , for all hold John as a prophet . "
they answered Jesus , and said , " We don 't know . " he also said to them , " Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things .
but what do you think ? a man had two sons , and he came to the first , and said , ' Son , go work today in my vineyard . '
he answered , ' I will not , ' but afterward he changed his mind , and went .
he came to the second , and said the same thing . he answered , ' I go , sir , ' but he didn 't go .
for John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you didn 't believe him , but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him . when you saw it , you didn 't even repent afterward , that you might believe him .
when the season for the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the farmers , to receive his fruit .
the farmers took his servants , beat one , killed another , and stoned another .
again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they treated them the same way .
but afterward he sent to them his son , saying , ' They will respect my son . '
but the farmers , when they saw the son , said among themselves , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , and seize his inheritance . '
so they took him , and threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
when therefore the lord of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those farmers ? "
they told him , " He will miserably destroy those miserable men , and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers , who will give him the fruit in its season . "
" therefore I tell you , the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you , and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit .
he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces , but on whomever it will fall , it will scatter him as dust . "
when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables , they perceived that he spoke about them .
when they sought to seize him , they feared the multitudes , because they considered him to be a prophet .
Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them , saying ,
and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast , but they would not come .
but they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his own farm , another to his merchandise ,
and the rest grabbed his servants , and treated them shamefully , and killed them .
when the king heard that , he was angry , and sent his armies , destroyed those murderers , and burned their city .
" then he said to his servants , ' The wedding is ready , but those who were invited weren 't worthy .
those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together as many as they found , both bad and good . the wedding was filled with guests .
but when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man who didn 't have on wedding clothing ,
and he said to him , ' friend , how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing ? ' he was speechless .
then the king said to the servants , ' bind him hand and foot , take him away , and throw him into the outer darkness ; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be . '
for many are called , but few chosen . "
then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk .
tell us therefore , what do you think ? is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? "
but Jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , " Why do you test me , you hypocrites ?
show me the tax money . " they brought to him a denarius .
he asked them , " whose is this image and inscription ? "
they said to him , " Caesar 's . " then he said to them , " Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . "
when they heard it , they marveled , and left him , and went away .
now there were with us seven brothers . the first married and died , and having no seed left his wife to his brother .
in the same way , the second also , and the third , to the seventh .
after them all , the woman died .
in the resurrection therefore , whose wife will she be of the seven ? for they all had her . "
but Jesus answered them , " You are mistaken , not knowing the Scriptures , nor the power of God .
for in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are like God 's angels in heaven .
but concerning the resurrection of the dead , haven 't you read that which was spoken to you by God , saying ,
'i am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? ' God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . "
when the multitudes heard it , they were astonished at his teaching .
but the Pharisees , when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees , gathered themselves together .
one of them , a lawyer , asked him a question , testing him .
Jesus said to him , " ' You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , and with all your mind . '
this is the first and great commandment .
a second likewise is this , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . '
the whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments . "
he said to them , " How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord , saying ,
'The Lord said to my Lord , sit on my right hand , until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet ? '
" if then David calls him Lord , how is he his son ? "
no one was able to answer him a word , neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth .
then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples ,
all things therefore whatever they tell you to observe , observe and do , but don 't do their works ; for they say , and don 't do .
for they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them .
but all their works they do to be seen by men . they make their phylacteries broad , enlarge the fringes of their garments ,
and love the place of honor at feasts , the best seats in the synagogues ,
the salutations in the marketplaces , and to be called ' Rabbi , Rabbi ' by men .
but don 't you be called ' Rabbi , ' for one is your teacher , the Christ , and all of you are brothers .
call no man on the earth your father , for one is your Father , he who is in heaven .
neither be called masters , for one is your master , the Christ .
but he who is greatest among you will be your servant .
whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted .
" Woe to you , you blind guides , who say , ' Whoever swears by the temple , it is nothing ; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple , he is obligated . '
you blind fools ! for which is greater , the gold , or the temple that sanctifies the gold ?
'Whoever swears by the altar , it is nothing ; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it , he is obligated ? '
you blind fools ! for which is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifies the gift ?
he therefore who swears by the altar , swears by it , and by everything on it .
he who swears by the temple , swears by it , and by him who was living in it .
he who swears by heaven , swears by the throne of God , and by him who sits on it .
you blind guides , who strain out a gnat , and swallow a Camel !
" Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness .
you blind Pharisee , first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter , that its outside may become clean also .
" Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you are like whitened tombs , which outwardly appear beautiful , but inwardly are full of dead men 's bones , and of all uncleanness .
even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men , but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
" Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you build the tombs of the prophets , and decorate the tombs of the righteous ,
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we wouldn 't have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . '
therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets .
fill up , then , the measure of your fathers .
you Serpents , you offspring of vipers , how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna ?
therefore behold , I send to you prophets , wise men , and scribes . some of them you will kill and crucify ; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues , and persecute from city to city ;
most certainly I tell you , all these things will come upon this generation .
behold , your house is left to you desolate .
for I tell you , you will not see me from now on , until you say , ' blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ' "
Jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way . his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
but he answered them , " You see all of these things , don 't you ? most certainly I tell you , there will not be left here one stone on another , that will not be thrown down . "
Jesus answered them , " Be careful that no one leads you astray .
for many will come in my name , saying , ' I am the Christ , ' and will lead many astray .
you will hear of wars and rumors of wars . see that you aren 't troubled , for all this must happen , but the end is not yet .
for nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there will be famines , plagues , and earthquakes in various places .
but all these things are the beginning of birth pains .
then they will deliver you up to oppression , and will kill you . you will be hated by all of the nations for my name 's sake .
then many will stumble , and will deliver up one another , and will hate one another .
many false prophets will arise , and will lead many astray .
because iniquity will be multiplied , the love of many will grow cold .
but he who endures to the end , the same will be saved .
this Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations , and then the end will come .
" when , therefore , you see the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house .
let him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes .
but woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days !
pray that your flight will not be in the winter , nor on a Sabbath ,
for then there will be great oppression , such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now , no , nor ever will be .
unless those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved . but for the sake of the chosen ones , those days will be shortened .
" then if any man tells you , ' behold , here is the Christ , ' or , ' There , ' don 't believe it .
for there will arise false christs , and false prophets , and they will show great signs and wonders , so as to lead astray , if possible , even the chosen ones .
" behold , I have told you beforehand .
if therefore they tell you , ' behold , he is in the wilderness , ' don 't go out ; ' behold , he is in the inner rooms , ' don 't believe it .
for as the lightning flashes from the east , and is seen even to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
for wherever the carcass is , there is where the vultures gather together .
but immediately after the oppression of those days , the sun will be darkened , the moon will not give its light , the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken ;
and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky . then all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory .
he will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from one end of the sky to the other .
" now from the fig tree learn this parable . when its branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near .
even so you also , when you see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
most certainly I tell you , this generation will not pass away , until all these things are accomplished .
heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
but no one knows of that day and hour , not even the angels of heaven , but my Father only .
" as the days of Noah were , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
for as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship ,
and they didn 't know until the flood came , and took them all away , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
then two men will be in the field : one will be taken and one will be left ;
two women grinding at the mill , one will be taken and one will be left .
watch therefore , for you don 't know in what hour your Lord comes .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
therefore also be ready , for in an hour that you don 't expect , the Son of Man will come .
" who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his lord has set over his household , to give them their food in due season ?
blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes .
most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has .
" then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins , who took their lamps , and went out to meet the bridegroom .
five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
those who were foolish , when they took their lamps , took no oil with them ,
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
now while the bridegroom delayed , they all slumbered and slept .
but at midnight there was a cry , ' behold ! the bridegroom is coming ! come out to meet him ! '
then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
the foolish said to the wise , ' Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out . '
but the wise answered , saying , ' What if there isn 't enough for us and you ? you go rather to those who sell , and buy for yourselves . '
while they went away to buy , the bridegroom came , and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast , and the door was shut .
afterward the other virgins also came , saying , ' Lord , Lord , open to us . '
but he answered , ' Most certainly I tell you , I don 't know you . '
watch therefore , for you don 't know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming .
" for it is like a man , going into another country , who called his own servants , and entrusted his goods to them .
to one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one ; to each according to his own ability . then he went on his journey .
immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them , and made another five talents .
in the same way , he also who got the two gained another two .
but he who received the one went away and dug in the earth , and hid his lord 's money .
" now after a long time the lord of those servants came , and reconciled accounts with them .
he who received the five talents came and brought another five talents , saying , ' Lord , you delivered to me five talents . behold , I have gained another five talents besides them . '
" he also who had received the one talent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you that you are a hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not scatter .
I was afraid , and went away and hid your talent in the earth . behold , you have what is yours . '
take away therefore the talent from him , and give it to him who has the ten talents .
for to everyone who has will be given , and he will have abundance , but from him who doesn 't have , even that which he has will be taken away .
throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . '
" but when the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then he will sit on the throne of his glory .
before him all the nations will be gathered , and he will separate them one from another , as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
he will set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
for I was hungry , and you gave me food to eat . I was thirsty , and you gave me drink . I was a stranger , and you took me in .
I was naked , and you clothed me . I was sick , and you visited me . I was in prison , and you came to me . '
" then the righteous will answer him , saying , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry , and feed you ; or thirsty , and give you a drink ?
when did we see you as a stranger , and take you in ; or naked , and clothe you ?
when did we see you sick , or in prison , and come to you ? '
" the King will answer them , ' Most certainly I tell you , inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers , you did it to me . '
then he will say also to those on the left hand , ' depart from me , you Cursed , into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels ;
" then they will also answer , saying , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry , or thirsty , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and didn 't help you ? '
" then he will answer them , saying , ' Most certainly I tell you , inasmuch as you didn 't do it to one of the least of these , you didn 't do it to me . '
these will go away into eternal punishment , but the righteous into eternal life . "
then the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas .
they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit , and kill him .
but they said , " Not during the feast , lest a riot occur among the people . "
but when his disciples saw this , they were indignant , saying , " Why this waste ?
for this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor . "
however , knowing this , Jesus said to them , " Why do you trouble the woman ? because she has done a good work for me .
for you always have the poor with you ; but you don 't always have me .
for in pouring this ointment on my body , she did it to prepare me for burial .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her . "
from that time he sought opportunity to betray him .
now on the first day of unleavened bread , the disciples came to Jesus , saying to him , " Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover ? "
the disciples did as Jesus commanded them , and they prepared the Passover .
now when evening had come , he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples .
as they were eating , he said , " Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me . "
they were exceedingly sorrowful , and each began to ask him , " It isn 't me , is it , Lord ? "
he answered , " He who dipped his hand with me in the dish , the same will betray me .
the Son of Man goes , even as it is written of him , but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
Judas , who betrayed him , answered , " It isn 't me , is it , Rabbi ? " he said to him , " You said it . "
as they were eating , Jesus took bread , gave thanks for it , and broke it . he gave to the disciples , and said , " Take , eat ; this is my body . "
he took the cup , gave thanks , and gave to them , saying , " All of you drink it ,
for this is my blood of the new Covenant , which is poured out for many for the remission of sins .
but I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on , until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father 's Kingdom . "
when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of olives .
then Jesus said to them , " All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight , for it is written , ' I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . '
but after I am raised up , I will go before you into Galilee . "
but Peter answered him , " Even if all will be made to stumble because of you , I will never be made to stumble . "
Jesus said to him , " Most certainly I tell you that tonight , before the rooster Crows , you will deny me three times . "
Peter said to him , " Even if I must die with you , I will not deny you . " all of the disciples also said likewise .
then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane , and said to his disciples , " sit here , while I go there and pray . "
he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled .
then he said to them , " My soul is exceedingly sorrowful , even to death . stay here , and watch with me . "
he went forward a little , fell on his face , and prayed , saying , " My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass away from me ; nevertheless , not what I desire , but what you desire . "
he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , " What , couldn 't you watch with me for one hour ?
watch and pray , that you don 't enter into temptation . the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
again , a second time he went away , and prayed , saying , " My Father , if this cup can 't pass away from me unless I drink it , your desire be done . "
he came again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
he left them again , went away , and prayed a third time , saying the same words .
then he came to his disciples , and said to them , " Sleep on now , and take your rest . behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
arise , let 's be going . behold , he who betrays me is at hand . "
while he was still speaking , behold , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs , from the chief priest and elders of the people .
now he who betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , " Whoever I kiss , he is the one . seize him . "
immediately he came to Jesus , and said , " hail , Rabbi ! " and kissed him .
Jesus said to him , " friend , why are you here ? " then they came and laid hands on Jesus , and took him .
behold , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
then Jesus said to him , " Put your sword back into its place , for all those who take the sword will die by the sword .
or do you think that I couldn 't ask my Father , and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels ?
how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so ? "
in that hour Jesus said to the multitudes , " Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me ? I sat daily in the temple teaching , and you didn 't arrest me .
but all this has happened , that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . " then all the disciples left him , and fled .
those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together .
but Peter followed him from a distance , to the court of the high priest , and entered in and sat with the officers , to see the end .
now the chief priests , the elders , and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus , that they might put him to death ;
the high priest stood up , and said to him , " Have you no answer ? what is this that these testify against you ? "
but Jesus held his peace . the high priest answered him , " I adjure you by the living God , that you tell us whether you are the Christ , the Son of God . "
Jesus said to him , " You have said it . nevertheless , I tell you , after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming on the clouds of the sky . "
then the high priest tore his clothing , saying , " He has spoken blasphemy ! why do we need any more witnesses ? behold , now you have heard his blasphemy .
what do you think ? " they answered , " He is worthy of death ! "
then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists , and some slapped him ,
now Peter was sitting outside in the court , and a maid came to him , saying , " You were also with Jesus , the Galilean ! "
but he denied it before them all , saying , " I don 't know what you are talking about . "
when he had gone out onto the porch , someone else saw him , and said to those who were there , " This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth . "
again he denied it with an oath , " I don 't know the man . "
after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter , " surely you are also one of them , for your speech makes you known . "
then he began to curse and to swear , " I don 't know the man ! " immediately the rooster crowed .
Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him , " Before the rooster Crows , you will deny me three times . " he went out and wept bitterly .
now when morning had come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
and they bound him , and led him away , and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate , the governor .
then Judas , who betrayed him , when he saw that Jesus was condemned , felt remorse , and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
saying , " I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood . " but they said , " What is that to us ? you see to it . "
he threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary , and departed . he went away and hanged himself .
the chief priests took the pieces of silver , and said , " It 's not lawful to put them into the treasury , since it is the price of blood . "
they took counsel , and bought the Potter 's field with them , to bury strangers in .
therefore that field was called " The Field of Blood " to this day .
now Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " Jesus said to him , " So you say . "
when he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
then Pilate said to him , " Don 't you hear how many things they testify against you ? "
he gave him no answer , not even one word , so that the governor marveled greatly .
now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner , whom they desired .
they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas .
when therefore they were gathered together , Pilate said to them , " whom do you want me to release to you ? Barabbas , or Jesus , who is called Christ ? "
for he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up .
now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
but the governor answered them , " Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? " they said , " Barabbas ! "
Pilate said to them , " What then shall I do to Jesus , who is called Christ ? " they all said to him , " Let him be crucified ! "
but the governor said , " Why ? what evil has he done ? " but they cried out exceedingly , saying , " Let him be crucified ! "
all the people answered , " May his blood be on us , and on our children ! "
then he released to them Barabbas , but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified .
then the governor 's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium , and gathered the whole garrison together against him .
they stripped him , and put a scarlet robe on him .
they braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head , and a Reed in his right hand ; and they kneeled down before him , and mocked him , saying , " hail , King of the Jews ! "
they spat on him , and took the Reed and struck him on the head .
when they had mocked him , they took the robe off of him , and put his clothes on him , and led him away to crucify him .
as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name , and they compelled him to go with them , that he might carry his cross .
they came to a place called " golgotha , " that is to say , " The place of a skull . "
when they had crucified him , they divided his clothing among them , casting lots ,
and they sat and watched him there .
then there were two robbers crucified with him , one on his right hand and one on the left .
those who passed by blasphemed him , wagging their heads ,
he trusts in God . let God deliver him now , if he wants him ; for he said , ' I am the Son of God . ' "
the robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach .
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour .
about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , " Eli , Eli , Lima sabachthani ? " that is , " My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? "
some of them who stood there , when they heard it , said , " This man is calling Elijah . "
immediately one of them ran , and took a sponge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a Reed , and gave him a drink .
the rest said , " Let him be . let 's see whether Elijah comes to save him . "
Jesus cried again with a loud voice , and yielded up his spirit .
behold , the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom . the earth quaked and the rocks were split .
the tombs were opened , and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised ;
and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection , they entered into the holy city and appeared to many .
now the centurion , and those who were with him watching Jesus , when they saw the earthquake , and the things that were done , feared exceedingly , saying , " Truly this was the Son of God . "
many women were there watching from afar , who had followed Jesus from Galilee , serving him .
among them were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
when evening had come , a rich man from Arimathaea , named Joseph , who himself was also Jesus ' disciple came .
Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
Mary Magdalene was there , and the other Mary , sitting opposite the tomb .
command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day , lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away , and tell the people , ' He is risen from the dead ; ' and the last deception will be worse than the first . "
Pilate said to them , " You have a guard . go , make it as secure as you can . "
so they went with the guard and made the tomb secure , sealing the stone .
now after the Sabbath , as it began to dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb .
behold , there was a great earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky , and came and rolled away the stone from the door , and sat on it .
his appearance was like lightning , and his clothing white as snow .
for fear of him , the guards shook , and became like dead men .
the angel answered the women , " Don 't be afraid , for I know that you seek Jesus , who has been crucified .
he is not here , for he has risen , just like he said . come , see the place where the Lord was lying .
go quickly and tell his disciples , ' He has risen from the dead , and behold , he goes before you into Galilee ; there you will see him . ' behold , I have told you . "
they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy , and ran to bring his disciples word .
as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , " rejoice ! " they came and took hold of his feet , and worshiped him .
then Jesus said to them , " Don 't be afraid . go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee , and there they will see me . "
now while they were going , behold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief priests all the things that had happened .
if this comes to the governor 's ears , we will persuade him and make you free of worry . "
so they took the money and did as they were told . this saying was spread abroad among the Jews , and continues until this day .
but the eleven disciples went into Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had sent them .
when they saw him , they bowed down to him , but some doubted .
Jesus came to them and spoke to them , saying , " All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth .
go , and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you . behold , I am with you always , even to the end of the age . " Amen .
the beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
as it is written in the prophets , " behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you .
the voice of one crying in the wilderness , ' Make ready the way of the Lord ! make his paths straight ! ' "
John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins .
all the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him . they were baptized by him in the Jordan river , confessing their sins .
John was clothed with Camel 's hair and a leather belt around his waist . he ate locusts and wild honey .
he preached , saying , " After me comes he who is mightier than I , the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen .
I baptized you in water , but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit . "
it happened in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
immediately coming up from the water , he saw the heavens parting , and the Spirit descending on him like a dove .
a voice came out of the sky , " You are my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . "
immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness .
he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan . he was with the wild animals ; and the angels were serving him .
now after John was taken into custody , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God ,
and saying , " The time is fulfilled , and the Kingdom of God is at hand ! repent , and believe in the Good News . "
passing along by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea , for they were fishermen .
Jesus said to them , " Come after me , and I will make you into fishers for men . "
immediately they left their nets , and followed him .
going on a little further from there , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John , his brother , who were also in the boat mending the nets .
immediately he called them , and they left their father , Zebedee , in the boat with the hired servants , and went after him .
they went into Capernaum , and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught .
they were astonished at his teaching , for he taught them as having authority , and not as the scribes .
Jesus rebuked him , saying , " Be quiet , and come out of him ! "
the unclean spirit , convulsing him and crying with a loud voice , came out of him .
the report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area .
immediately , when they had come out of the synagogue , they came into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
now Simon 's wife 's mother lay sick with a fever , and immediately they told him about her .
he came and took her by the hand , and raised her up . the fever left her , and she served them .
at evening , when the sun had set , they brought to him all who were sick , and those who were possessed by demons .
all the city was gathered together at the door .
he healed many who were sick with various diseases , and cast out many demons . he didn 't allow the demons to speak , because they knew him .
early in the morning , while it was still dark , he rose up and went out , and departed into a deserted place , and prayed there .
Simon and those who were with him followed after him ;
he said to them , " Let 's go elsewhere into the next towns , that I may preach there also , because I came out for this reason . "
he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee , preaching and casting out demons .
a leper came to him , begging him , kneeling down to him , and saying to him , " If you want to , you can make me clean . "
being moved with compassion , he stretched out his hand , and touched him , and said to him , " I want to . be made clean . "
when he had said this , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was made clean .
he strictly warned him , and immediately sent him out ,
and said to him , " See you say nothing to anybody , but go show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
when he entered again into Capernaum after some days , it was heard that he was in the house .
immediately many were gathered together , so that there was no more room , not even around the door ; and he spoke the word to them .
four people came , carrying a paralytic to him .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the roof where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the Mat that the paralytic was lying on .
Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paralytic , " Son , your sins are forgiven you . "
immediately Jesus , perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , said to them , " Why do you reason these things in your hearts ?
which is easier , to tell the paralytic , ' Your sins are forgiven ; ' or to say , ' arise , and take up your bed , and walk ? '
he arose , and immediately took up the Mat , and went out in front of them all ; so that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , " We never saw anything like this ! "
he went out again by the seaside . all the multitude came to him , and he taught them .
as he passed by , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus , sitting at the tax office , and he said to him , " Follow me . " and he arose and followed him .
it happened , that he was reclining at the table in his house , and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many , and they followed him .
the scribes and the Pharisees , when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors , said to his disciples , " Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners ? "
when Jesus heard it , he said to them , " Those who are healthy have no need for a physician , but those who are sick . I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . "
John 's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting , and they came and asked him , " Why do John 's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but your disciples don 't fast ? "
Jesus said to them , " Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can 't fast .
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then will they fast in that day .
no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old , and a worse hole is made .
no one puts new wine into old wineskins , or else the new wine will burst the skins , and the wine pours out , and the skins will be destroyed ; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins . "
it happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields , and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of grain .
the Pharisees said to him , " behold , why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day ? "
he said to them , " did you never read what David did , when he had need , and was hungry--he , and those who were with him ?
how he entered into God 's house when Abiathar was high priest , and ate the show bread , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests , and gave also to those who were with him ? "
he said to them , " The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath .
therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath . "
he entered again into the synagogue , and there was a man there who had his hand withered .
they watched him , whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day , that they might accuse him .
he said to the man who had his hand withered , " Stand up . "
when he had looked around at them with anger , being grieved at the hardening of their hearts , he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " he stretched it out , and his hand was restored as healthy as the other .
the Pharisees went out , and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
he spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd , so that they wouldn 't press on him .
for he had healed many , so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him .
the unclean spirits , whenever they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , " You are the Son of God ! "
he sternly warned them that they should not make him known .
he went up into the mountain , and called to himself those whom he wanted , and they went to him .
the multitude came together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
when his friends heard it , they went out to seize him : for they said , " He is insane . "
the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , " He has Beelzebul , " and , " By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons . "
he summoned them , and said to them in parables , " How can Satan cast out Satan ?
if a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
if a house is divided against itself , that house cannot stand .
if Satan has risen up against himself , and is divided , he can 't stand , but has an end .
but no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder , unless he first binds the strong man ; and then he will plunder his house .
--because they said , " He has an unclean spirit . "
his mother and his brothers came , and standing outside , they sent to him , calling him .
a multitude was sitting around him , and they told him , " behold , your mother , your brothers , and your sisters are outside looking for you . "
he answered them , " Who are my mother and my brothers ? "
looking around at those who sat around him , he said , " behold , my mother and my brothers !
for whoever does the will of God , the same is my brother , and my sister , and mother . "
again he began to teach by the seaside . a great multitude was gathered to him , so that he entered into a boat in the sea , and sat down . all the multitude were on the land by the sea .
he taught them many things in parables , and told them in his teaching ,
and it happened , as he sowed , some seed fell by the road , and the birds came and devoured it .
others fell on the rocky ground , where it had little soil , and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil .
when the sun had risen , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
others fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
others fell into the good ground , and yielded fruit , growing up and increasing . some brought forth thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times as much . "
he said , " Whoever has ears to hear , let him hear . "
when he was alone , those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables .
he said to them , " To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God , but to those who are outside , all things are done in parables ,
that ' seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sins should be forgiven them . ' "
he said to them , " Don 't you understand this parable ? how will you understand all of the parables ?
the farmer sows the word .
the ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown ; and when they have heard , immediately Satan comes , and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , some thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times . "
he said to them , " Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed ? Isn 't it put on a stand ?
for there is nothing hidden , except that it should be made known ; neither was anything made secret , but that it should come to light .
if any man has ears to hear , let him hear . "
he said to them , " Take heed what you hear . with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you , and more will be given to you who hear .
for whoever has , to him will more be given , and he who doesn 't have , even that which he has will be taken away from him . "
he said , " The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth ,
and should sleep and rise night and day , and the seed should spring up and grow , he doesn 't know how .
for the earth bears fruit : first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
but when the fruit is ripe , immediately he puts forth the sickle , because the harvest has come . "
he said , " How will we liken the Kingdom of God ? or with what parable will we illustrate it ?
with many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it .
without a parable he didn 't speak to them ; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything .
on that day , when evening had come , he said to them , " Let 's go over to the other side . "
leaving the multitude , they took him with them , even as he was , in the boat . other small boats were also with him .
a big wind storm arose , and the waves beat into the boat , so much that the boat was already filled .
he himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion , and they woke him up , and told him , " Teacher , don 't you care that we are dying ? "
he awoke , and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , " Peace ! be still ! " the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
he said to them , " Why are you so afraid ? how is it that you have no faith ? "
they were greatly afraid , and said to one another , " Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? "
they came to the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gadarenes .
when he had come out of the boat , immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs .
he lived in the tombs . nobody could bind him any more , not even with chains ,
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him , and the fetters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to tame him .
always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
when he saw Jesus from afar , he ran and bowed down to him ,
and crying out with a loud voice , he said , " What have I to do with you , Jesus , you Son of the Most High God ? I adjure you by God , don 't torment me . "
for he said to him , " Come out of the man , you unclean spirit ! "
he asked him , " What is your name ? " he said to him , " My name is Legion , for we are many . "
he begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding .
all the demons begged him , saying , " Send us into the pigs , that we may enter into them . "
at once Jesus gave them permission . the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs . the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea , and they were drowned in the sea .
those who fed them fled , and told it in the city and in the country . the people came to see what it was that had happened .
they came to Jesus , and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting , clothed , and in his right mind , even him who had the Legion ; and they were afraid .
those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons , and about the pigs .
they began to beg him to depart from their region .
as he was entering into the boat , he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him .
he didn 't allow him , but said to him , " Go to your house , to your friends , and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you , and how he had mercy on you . "
he went his way , and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him , and everyone marveled .
when Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side , a great multitude was gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
he went with him , and a great multitude followed him , and they pressed upon him on all sides .
a certain woman , who had an issue of blood for twelve years ,
and had suffered many things by many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was no better , but rather grew worse ,
having heard the things concerning Jesus , came up behind him in the crowd , and touched his clothes .
for she said , " If I just touch his clothes , I will be made well . "
immediately the flow of her blood was dried up , and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction .
immediately Jesus , perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him , turned around in the crowd , and asked , " Who touched my clothes ? "
his disciples said to him , " You see the multitude pressing against you , and you say , ' Who touched me ? ' "
he looked around to see her who had done this thing .
but the woman , fearing and trembling , knowing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
he said to her , " Daughter , your faith has made you well . go in peace , and be cured of your disease . "
while he was still speaking , people came from the synagogue ruler 's house saying , " Your daughter is dead . why bother the Teacher any more ? "
but Jesus , when he heard the message spoken , immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue , " Don 't be afraid , only believe . "
he allowed no one to follow him , except Peter , James , and John the brother of James .
he came to the synagogue ruler 's house , and he saw an uproar , weeping , and great wailing .
when he had entered in , he said to them , " Why do you make an uproar and weep ? the child is not dead , but is asleep . "
they ridiculed him . but he , having put them all out , took the father of the child , her mother , and those who were with him , and went in where the child was lying .
taking the child by the hand , he said to her , " Talitha cumi ! " which means , being interpreted , " Girl , I tell you , get up ! "
immediately the girl rose up and walked , for she was twelve years old . they were amazed with great amazement .
he strictly ordered them that no one should know this , and commanded that something should be given to her to eat .
he went out from there . he came into his own country , and his disciples followed him .
Isn 't this the carpenter , the son of Mary , and brother of James , Joses , Judah , and Simon ? Aren 't his sisters here with us ? " they were offended at him .
Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and among his own relatives , and in his own house . "
he could do no mighty work there , except that he laid his hands on a few sick people , and healed them .
he marveled because of their unbelief . he went around the villages teaching .
he called to himself the twelve , and began to send them out two by two ; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
he commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , except a staff only : no bread , no wallet , no money in their purse ,
but to wear sandals , and not put on two tunics .
he said to them , " wherever you enter into a house , stay there until you depart from there .
whoever will not receive you nor hear you , as you depart from there , shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them . Assuredly , I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city ! "
they went out and preached that people should repent .
they cast out many demons , and anointed many with oil who were sick , and healed them .
but others said , " He is Elijah . " others said , " He is a prophet , or like one of the prophets . "
but Herod , when he heard this , said , " This is John , whom I beheaded . he has risen from the dead . "
Herodias set herself against him , and desired to kill him , but she couldn 't ,
then a convenient day came , that Herod on his birthday made a Supper for his nobles , the high officers , and the chief men of Galilee .
when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced , she pleased Herod and those sitting with him . the king said to the young lady , " Ask me whatever you want , and I will give it to you . "
he swore to her , " Whatever you shall ask of me , I will give you , up to half of my kingdom . "
she went out , and said to her mother , " What shall I ask ? " she said , " The head of John the Baptizer . "
she came in immediately with haste to the king , and asked , " I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter . "
the king was exceedingly sorry , but for the sake of his oaths , and of his dinner guests , he didn 't wish to refuse her .
immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard , and commanded to bring John 's head , and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
and brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the young lady ; and the young lady gave it to her mother .
when his disciples heard this , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
the Apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus , and they told him all things , whatever they had done , and whatever they had taught .
he said to them , " You come apart into a deserted place , and rest awhile . " for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves .
they saw them going , and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities . they arrived before them and came together to him .
Jesus came out , saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd , and he began to teach them many things .
but he answered them , " You give them something to eat . " they asked him , " shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread , and give them something to eat ? "
he said to them , " How many loaves do you have ? go see . " when they knew , they said , " Five , and two fish . "
he commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass .
they sat down in ranks , by hundreds and by fifties .
he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he blessed and broke the loaves , and he gave to his disciples to set before them , and he divided the two fish among them all .
they all ate , and were filled .
those who ate the loaves were five thousand men .
immediately he made his disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead to the other side , to Bethsaida , while he himself sent the multitude away .
after he had taken leave of them , he went up the mountain to pray .
but they , when they saw him walking on the sea , supposed that it was a ghost , and cried out ;
for they all saw him , and were troubled . but he immediately spoke with them , and said to them , " cheer up ! it is I ! Don 't be afraid . "
he got into the boat with them ; and the wind ceased , and they were very amazed among themselves , and marveled ;
for they hadn 't understood about the loaves , but their hearts were hardened .
when they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret , and moored to the shore .
when they had come out of the boat , immediately the people recognized him ,
and ran around that whole region , and began to bring those who were sick , on their Mats , to where they heard he was .
then the Pharisees , and some of the scribes gathered together to him , having come from Jerusalem .
now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled , that is , unwashed , hands , they found fault .
( for the Pharisees , and all the Jews , don 't eat unless they wash their hands and forearms , holding to the tradition of the elders .
they don 't eat when they come from the marketplace , unless they bathe themselves , and there are many other things , which they have received to hold to : washings of cups , pitchers , bronze vessels , and couches . )
the Pharisees and the scribes asked him , " Why don 't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with unwashed hands ? "
he answered them , " Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites , as it is written , ' This people honors me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
but in vain do they worship me , teaching as doctrines the commandments of men . '
" for you set aside the commandment of God , and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups , and you do many other such things . "
he said to them , " Full well do you reject the commandment of God , that you may keep your tradition .
for Moses said , ' honor your father and your mother ; ' and , ' He who speaks evil of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
making void the word of God by your tradition , which you have handed down . you do many things like this . "
he called all the multitude to himself , and said to them , " Hear me , all of you , and understand .
there is nothing from outside of the man , that going into him can defile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man .
when he had entered into a house away from the multitude , his disciples asked him about the parable .
he said to them , " Are you thus without understanding also ? Don 't you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can 't defile him ,
because it doesn 't go into his heart , but into his stomach , then into the latrine , thus purifying all foods ? "
he said , " That which proceeds out of the man , that defiles the man .
all these evil things come from within , and defile the man . "
from there he arose , and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon . he entered into a house , and didn 't want anyone to know it , but he couldn 't escape notice .
for a woman , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having heard of him , came and fell down at his feet .
now the woman was a Greek , a Syrophoenician by race . she begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter .
but Jesus said to her , " Let the children be filled first , for it is not appropriate to take the children 's bread and throw it to the dogs . "
but she answered him , " Yes , Lord . yet even the dogs under the table eat the children 's crumbs . "
he said to her , " For this saying , go your way . the demon has gone out of your daughter . "
she went away to her house , and found the child having been laid on the bed , with the demon gone out .
again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and came to the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the region of Decapolis .
they brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech . they begged him to lay his hand on him .
he took him aside from the multitude , privately , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spat , and touched his tongue .
looking up to heaven , he sighed , and said to him , " Ephphatha ! " that is , " Be opened ! "
immediately his ears were opened , and the impediment of his tongue was released , and he spoke clearly .
he commanded them that they should tell no one , but the more he commanded them , so much the more widely they proclaimed it .
they were astonished beyond measure , saying , " He has done all things well . he makes even the deaf hear , and the mute speak ! "
if I send them away fasting to their home , they will faint on the way , for some of them have come a long way . "
his disciples answered him , " From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place ? "
he asked them , " How many loaves do you have ? " they said , " Seven . "
he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground , and he took the seven loaves . having given thanks , he broke them , and gave them to his disciples to serve , and they served the multitude .
they had a few small fish . having blessed them , he said to serve these also .
they ate , and were filled . they took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over .
those who had eaten were about four thousand . then he sent them away .
the Pharisees came out and began to question him , seeking from him a sign from heaven , and testing him .
he sighed deeply in his spirit , and said , " Why does this generation seek a sign ? most certainly I tell you , no sign will be given to this generation . "
he left them , and again entering into the boat , departed to the other side .
they forgot to take bread ; and they didn 't have more than one loaf in the boat with them .
he warned them , saying , " Take heed : beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod . "
they reasoned with one another , saying , " It 's because we have no bread . "
Jesus , perceiving it , said to them , " Why do you reason that it 's because you have no bread ? Don 't you perceive yet , neither understand ? is your heart still hardened ?
" when the seven loaves fed the four thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? " they told him , " Seven . "
he asked them , " Don 't you understand , yet ? "
he came to Bethsaida . they brought a blind man to him , and begged him to touch him .
he took hold of the blind man by the hand , and brought him out of the village . when he had spit on his eyes , and laid his hands on him , he asked him if he saw anything .
he looked up , and said , " I see men ; for I see them like trees walking . "
then again he laid his hands on his eyes . he looked intently , and was restored , and saw everyone clearly .
he sent him away to his house , saying , " Don 't enter into the village , nor tell anyone in the village . "
Jesus went out , with his disciples , into the villages of Caesarea Philippi . on the way he asked his disciples , " Who do men say that I am ? "
they told him , " John the Baptizer , and others say Elijah , but others : one of the prophets . "
he said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " You are the Christ . "
he commanded them that they should tell no one about him .
he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
he spoke to them openly . Peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
but he , turning around , and seeing his disciples , rebuked Peter , and said , " Get behind me , Satan ! for you have in mind not the things of God , but the things of men . "
he called the multitude to himself with his disciples , and said to them , " Whoever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever wants to save his life will lose it ; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it .
for what does it profit a man , to gain the whole world , and forfeit his life ?
for what will a man give in exchange for his life ?
he said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power . "
after six days Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
his clothing became glistening , exceedingly white , like snow , such as no launderer on earth can whiten them .
Elijah and Moses appeared to them , and they were talking with Jesus .
Peter answered Jesus , " Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . let 's make three tents : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
for he didn 't know what to say , for they were very afraid .
a cloud came , overshadowing them , and a voice came out of the cloud , " This is my beloved Son . listen to him . "
suddenly looking around , they saw no one with them any more , except Jesus only .
as they were coming down from the mountain , he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
they kept this saying to themselves , questioning what the " rising from the dead " meant .
they asked him , saying , " Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? "
but I tell you that Elijah has come , and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to , even as it is written about him . "
coming to the disciples , he saw a great multitude around them , and scribes questioning them .
immediately all the multitude , when they saw him , were greatly amazed , and running to him greeted him .
he asked the scribes , " What are you asking them ? "
one of the multitude answered , " Teacher , I brought to you my son , who has a mute spirit ;
he answered him , " Unbelieving generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I bear with you ? bring him to me . "
they brought him to him , and when he saw him , immediately the spirit convulsed him , and he fell on the ground , wallowing and foaming at the mouth .
he asked his father , " How long has it been since this has come to him ? " he said , " From childhood .
often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water , to destroy him . but if you can do anything , have compassion on us , and help us . "
Jesus said to him , " If you can believe , all things are possible to him who believes . "
immediately the father of the child cried out with tears , " I believe . help my unbelief ! "
when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to him , " You mute and deaf spirit , I command you , come out of him , and never enter him again ! "
but Jesus took him by the hand , and raised him up ; and he arose .
when he had come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , " Why couldn 't we cast it out ? "
he said to them , " This kind can come out by nothing , except by prayer and fasting . "
they went out from there , and passed through Galilee . he didn 't want anyone to know it .
for he was teaching his disciples , and said to them , " The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men , and they will kill him ; and when he is killed , on the third day he will rise again . "
but they didn 't understand the saying , and were afraid to ask him .
he came to Capernaum , and when he was in the house he asked them , " What were you arguing among yourselves on the way ? "
but they were silent , for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest .
he sat down , and called the twelve ; and he said to them , " If any man wants to be first , he shall be last of all , and servant of all . "
John said to him , " Teacher , we saw someone who doesn 't follow us casting out demons in your name ; and we forbade him , because he doesn 't follow us . "
but Jesus said , " Don 't forbid him , for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name , and be able quickly to speak evil of me .
for whoever is not against us is on our side .
for whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because you are Christ 's , most certainly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck .
if your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life maimed , rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna , into the unquenchable fire ,
if your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life lame , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna , into the fire that will never be quenched--
if your eye causes you to stumble , cast it out . it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire ,
'where their worm doesn 't die , and the fire is not quenched . '
for everyone will be salted with fire , and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt .
salt is good , but if the salt has lost its saltiness , with what will you season it ? have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . "
he arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan . multitudes came together to him again . as he usually did , he was again teaching them .
Pharisees came to him testing him , and asked him , " Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife ? "
he answered , " What did Moses command you ? "
they said , " Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written , and to divorce her . "
but Jesus said to them , " For your hardness of heart , he wrote you this commandment .
but from the beginning of the creation , God made them male and female .
what therefore God has joined together , let no man separate . "
in the house , his disciples asked him again about the same matter .
he said to them , " Whoever divorces his wife , and marries another , commits adultery against her .
if a woman herself divorces her husband , and marries another , she commits adultery . "
they were bringing to him little children , that he should touch them , but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them .
but when Jesus saw it , he was moved with indignation , and said to them , " allow the little children to come to me ! Don 't forbid them , for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
most certainly I tell you , whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child , he will in no way enter into it . "
he took them in his arms , and blessed them , laying his hands on them .
as he was going out into the way , one ran to him , knelt before him , and asked him , " Good Teacher , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? "
Jesus said to him , " Why do you call me good ? no one is good except one--God .
you know the commandments : ' do not murder , ' ' Do not commit adultery , ' ' Do not steal , ' ' Do not give false testimony , ' ' Do not defraud , ' ' honor your father and mother . ' "
he said to him , " Teacher , I have observed all these things from my youth . "
but his face fell at that saying , and he went away sorrowful , for he was one who had great possessions .
Jesus looked around , and said to his disciples , " How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God ! "
the disciples were amazed at his words . but Jesus answered again , " Children , how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God !
it is easier for a Camel to go through a needle 's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
they were exceedingly astonished , saying to him , " Then who can be saved ? "
Jesus , looking at them , said , " With men it is impossible , but not with God , for all things are possible with God . "
Peter began to tell him , " behold , we have left all , and have followed you . "
but many who are first will be last ; and the last first . "
they will mock him , spit on him , scourge him , and kill him . on the third day he will rise again . "
James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came near to him , saying , " Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we will ask . "
he said to them , " What do you want me to do for you ? "
they said to him , " Grant to us that we may sit , one at your right hand , and one at your left hand , in your glory . "
but Jesus said to them , " You don 't know what you are asking . are you able to drink the cup that I drink , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? "
when the ten heard it , they began to be indignant towards James and John .
Jesus summoned them , and said to them , " You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
but it shall not be so among you , but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant .
whoever of you wants to become first among you , shall be bondservant of all .
for the Son of Man also came not to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . "
they came to Jericho . as he went out from Jericho , with his disciples and a great multitude , the son of Timaeus , Bartimaeus , a blind beggar , was sitting by the road .
when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene , he began to cry out , and say , " Jesus , you son of David , have mercy on me ! "
many rebuked him , that he should be quiet , but he cried out much more , " You son of David , have mercy on me ! "
Jesus stood still , and said , " Call him . " they called the blind man , saying to him , " cheer up ! get up . he is calling you ! "
he , casting away his cloak , sprang up , and came to Jesus .
Jesus asked him , " What do you want me to do for you ? " the blind man said to him , " Rabboni , that I may see again . "
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your faith has made you well . " immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
if anyone asks you , ' Why are you doing this ? ' say , ' The Lord needs him ; ' and immediately he will send him back here . "
they went away , and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street , and they untied him .
some of those who stood there asked them , " What are you doing , untying the young donkey ? "
they said to them just as Jesus had said , and they let them go .
they brought the young donkey to Jesus , and threw their garments on it , and Jesus sat on it .
many spread their garments on the way , and others were cutting down branches from the trees , and spreading them on the road .
those who went in front , and those who followed , cried out , " Hosanna ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem . when he had looked around at everything , it being now evening , he went out to Bethany with the twelve .
the next day , when they had come out from Bethany , he was hungry .
seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it . when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
Jesus told it , " May no one ever eat fruit from you again ! " and his disciples heard it .
they came to Jerusalem , and Jesus entered into the temple , and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the money changers , and the seats of those who sold the doves .
he would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple .
he taught , saying to them , " Isn 't it written , ' My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? ' but you have made it a den of robbers ! "
the chief priests and the scribes heard it , and sought how they might destroy him . for they feared him , because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching .
when evening came , he went out of the city .
as they passed by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots .
Peter , remembering , said to him , " Rabbi , look ! the fig tree which you Cursed has withered away . "
Jesus answered them , " Have faith in God .
for most certainly I tell you , whoever may tell this mountain , ' Be taken up and cast into the sea , ' and doesn 't doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says is happening ; he shall have whatever he says .
therefore I tell you , all things whatever you pray and ask for , believe that you have received them , and you shall have them .
whenever you stand praying , forgive , if you have anything against anyone ; so that your Father , who is in heaven , may also forgive you your transgressions .
Jesus said to them , " I will ask you one question . answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
the baptism of John--was it from heaven , or from men ? answer me . "
they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we should say , ' From heaven ; ' he will say , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
if we should say , ' From men ' " --they feared the people , for all held John to really be a prophet .
they answered Jesus , " We don 't know . " Jesus said to them , " Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things . "
he began to speak to them in parables . " a man planted a vineyard , put a hedge around it , dug a pit for the winepress , built a tower , rented it out to a farmer , and went into another country .
when it was time , he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard .
they took him , beat him , and sent him away empty .
again , he sent another servant to them ; and they threw stones at him , wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully treated .
again he sent another ; and they killed him ; and many others , beating some , and killing some .
therefore still having one , his beloved son , he sent him last to them , saying , ' They will respect my son . '
but those farmers said among themselves , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , and the inheritance will be ours . '
they took him , killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the farmers , and will give the vineyard to others .
haven 't you even read this Scripture : ' the stone which the builders rejected , the same was made the head of the corner .
they tried to seize him , but they feared the multitude ; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them . they left him , and went away .
they sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him , that they might trap him with words .
shall we give , or shall we not give ? " but he , knowing their hypocrisy , said to them , " Why do you test me ? bring me a denarius , that I may see it . "
they brought it . he said to them , " whose is this image and inscription ? " they said to him , " Caesar 's . "
Jesus answered them , " render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . " they marveled greatly at him .
there were seven brothers . the first took a wife , and dying left no offspring .
the second took her , and died , leaving no children behind him . the third likewise ;
and the seven took her and left no children . last of all the woman also died .
in the resurrection , when they rise , whose wife will she be of them ? for the seven had her as a wife . "
Jesus answered them , " Isn 't this because you are mistaken , not knowing the Scriptures , nor the power of God ?
for when they will rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
he is not the God of the dead , but of the living . you are therefore badly mistaken . "
Jesus answered , " The greatest is , ' Hear , Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is one :
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first commandment .
the second is like this , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ' there is no other commandment greater than these . "
the scribe said to him , " Truly , teacher , you have said well that he is one , and there is none other but he ,
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . "
when Jesus saw that he answered wisely , he said to him , " You are not far from the Kingdom of God . " no one dared ask him any question after that .
Jesus responded , as he taught in the temple , " How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David ?
for David himself said in the Holy Spirit , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet . " '
therefore David himself calls him Lord , so how can he be his son ? " the common people heard him gladly .
those who devour widows ' houses , and for a pretense make long prayers . these will receive greater condemnation . "
Jesus sat down opposite the treasury , and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury . many who were rich cast in much .
a poor widow came , and she cast in two small brass coins , which equal a quadrans coin .
he called his disciples to himself , and said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury ,
for they all gave out of their abundance , but she , out of her poverty , gave all that she had to live on . "
as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples said to him , " Teacher , see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings ! "
Jesus said to him , " Do you see these great buildings ? there will not be left here one stone on another , which will not be thrown down . "
Jesus , answering , began to tell them , " Be careful that no one leads you astray .
for many will come in my name , saying , ' I am he ! ' and will lead many astray .
" when you hear of wars and rumors of wars , don 't be troubled . for those must happen , but the end is not yet .
for nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . there will be earthquakes in various places . there will be famines and troubles . these things are the beginning of birth pains .
but watch yourselves , for they will deliver you up to councils . you will be beaten in synagogues . you will stand before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them .
the Good News must first be preached to all the nations .
when they lead you away and deliver you up , don 't be anxious beforehand , or premeditate what you will say , but say whatever will be given you in that hour . for it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spirit .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
you will be hated by all men for my name 's sake , but he who endures to the end , the same will be saved .
but when you see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not ( let the reader understand ) , then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains ,
and let him who is on the housetop not go down , nor enter in , to take anything out of his house .
let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak .
but woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days !
pray that your flight won 't be in the winter .
for in those days there will be oppression , such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will be .
unless the Lord had shortened the days , no flesh would have been saved ; but for the sake of the chosen ones , whom he picked out , he shortened the days .
then if anyone tells you , ' Look , here is the Christ ! ' or , ' Look , there ! ' Don 't believe it .
for there will arise false christs and false prophets , and will show signs and wonders , that they may lead astray , if possible , even the chosen ones .
but you watch . " behold , I have told you all things beforehand .
but in those days , after that oppression , the sun will be darkened , the moon will not give its light ,
then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
then he will send out his angels , and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky .
" now from the fig tree , learn this parable . when the branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near ;
even so you also , when you see these things coming to pass , know that it is near , at the doors .
most certainly I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things happen .
heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
but of that day or that hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
watch , keep alert , and pray ; for you don 't know when the time is .
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch .
watch therefore , for you don 't know when the lord of the house is coming , whether at evening , or at midnight , or when the rooster Crows , or in the morning ;
lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping .
what I tell you , I tell all : watch . "
it was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread , and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception , and kill him .
for they said , " Not during the feast , because there might be a riot of the people . "
but Jesus said , " Leave her alone . why do you trouble her ? she has done a good work for me .
for you always have the poor with you , and whenever you want to , you can do them good ; but you will not always have me .
she has done what she could . she has anointed my body beforehand for the burying .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world , that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve , went away to the chief priests , that he might deliver him to them .
they , when they heard it , were glad , and promised to give him money . he sought how he might conveniently deliver him .
on the first day of unleavened bread , when they sacrificed the Passover , his disciples asked him , " Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover ? "
he sent two of his disciples , and said to them , " Go into the city , and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water . follow him ,
and wherever he enters in , tell the master of the house , ' The Teacher says , " Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? " '
he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready . get ready for us there . "
his disciples went out , and came into the city , and found things as he had said to them , and they prepared the Passover .
when it was evening he came with the twelve .
as they sat and were eating , Jesus said , " Most certainly I tell you , one of you will betray me--he who eats with me . "
they began to be sorrowful , and to ask him one by one , " surely not I ? " and another said , " surely not I ? "
he answered them , " It is one of the twelve , he who dips with me in the dish .
for the Son of Man goes , even as it is written about him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and when he had blessed , he broke it , and gave to them , and said , " Take , eat . this is my body . "
he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave to them . they all drank of it .
he said to them , " This is my blood of the new Covenant , which is poured out for many .
most certainly I tell you , I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God . "
when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of olives .
Jesus said to them , " All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight , for it is written , ' I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . '
however , after I am raised up , I will go before you into Galilee . "
but Peter said to him , " Although all will be offended , yet I will not . "
Jesus said to him , " Most certainly I tell you , that you today , even this night , before the rooster Crows twice , you will deny me three times . "
but he spoke all the more , " If I must die with you , I will not deny you . " they all said the same thing .
they came to a place which was named Gethsemane . he said to his disciples , " sit here , while I pray . "
he took with him Peter , James , and John , and began to be greatly troubled and distressed .
he said to them , " My soul is exceedingly sorrowful , even to death . stay here , and watch . "
he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
he said , " ABBA , Father , all things are possible to you . please remove this cup from me . however , not what I desire , but what you desire . "
he came and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , " Simon , are you sleeping ? Couldn 't you watch one hour ?
watch and pray , that you may not enter into temptation . the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
again he went away , and prayed , saying the same words .
again he returned , and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy , and they didn 't know what to answer him .
he came the third time , and said to them , " Sleep on now , and take your rest . it is enough . the hour has come . behold , the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
arise , let us be going . behold , he who betrays me is at hand . "
immediately , while he was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve , came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs , from the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders .
now he who betrayed him had given them a sign , saying , " whomever I will kiss , that is he . seize him , and lead him away safely . "
when he had come , immediately he came to him , and said , " Rabbi ! rabbi ! " and kissed him .
they laid their hands on him , and seized him .
but a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
Jesus answered them , " Have you come out , as against a robber , with swords and clubs to seize me ?
I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and you didn 't arrest me . but this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled . "
they all left him , and fled .
a certain young man followed him , having a linen cloth thrown around himself , over his naked body . the young men grabbed him ,
but he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
they led Jesus away to the high priest . all the chief priests , the elders , and the scribes came together with him .
Peter had followed him from a distance , until he came into the court of the high priest . he was sitting with the officers , and warming himself in the light of the fire .
now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death , and found none .
for many gave false testimony against him , and their testimony didn 't agree with each other .
even so , their testimony did not agree .
the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , " Have you no answer ? what is it which these testify against you ? "
but he stayed quiet , and answered nothing . again the high priest asked him , " Are you the Christ , the Son of the blessed ? "
Jesus said , " I am . you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming with the clouds of the sky . "
some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to beat him with fists , and to tell him , " Prophesy ! " the officers struck him with the palms of their hands .
but he denied it , saying , " I neither know , nor understand what you are saying . " he went out on the porch , and the rooster crowed .
the maid saw him , and began again to tell those who stood by , " This is one of them . "
but he again denied it . after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter , " You truly are one of them , for you are a Galilean , and your speech shows it . "
but he began to curse , and to swear , " I don 't know this man of whom you speak ! "
the rooster crowed the second time . Peter remembered the word , how that Jesus said to him , " Before the rooster Crows twice , you will deny me three times . " when he thought about that , he wept .
immediately in the morning the chief priests , with the elders and scribes , and the whole council , held a consultation , and bound Jesus , and carried him away , and delivered him up to Pilate .
Pilate asked him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " he answered , " So you say . "
the chief priests accused him of many things .
Pilate again asked him , " Have you no answer ? see how many things they testify against you ! "
but Jesus made no further answer , so that Pilate marveled .
now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner , whom they asked of him .
there was one called Barabbas , bound with those who had made insurrection , men who in the insurrection had committed murder .
the multitude , crying aloud , began to ask him to do as he always did for them .
Pilate answered them , saying , " Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? "
for he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up .
but the chief priests stirred up the multitude , that he should release Barabbas to them instead .
Pilate again asked them , " What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews ? "
they cried out again , " Crucify him ! "
Pilate said to them , " Why , what evil has he done ? " but they cried out exceedingly , " Crucify him ! "
Pilate , wishing to please the multitude , released Barabbas to them , and handed over Jesus , when he had flogged him , to be crucified .
the soldiers led him away within the court , which is the Praetorium ; and they called together the whole cohort .
they clothed him with purple , and weaving a crown of thorns , they put it on him .
they began to salute him , " hail , King of the Jews ! "
they struck his head with a Reed , and spat on him , and bowing their knees , did Homage to him .
when they had mocked him , they took the purple off of him , and put his own garments on him . they led him out to crucify him .
they compelled one passing by , coming from the country , Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to go with them , that he might bear his cross .
they brought him to the place called golgotha , which is , being interpreted , " The place of a skull . "
they offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink , but he didn 't take it .
Crucifying him , they parted his garments among them , casting lots on them , what each should take .
it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
the superscription of his accusation was written over him , " the King of the Jews . "
with him they crucified two robbers ; one on his right hand , and one on his left .
likewise , also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said , " He saved others . he can 't save himself .
let the Christ , the King of Israel , now come down from the cross , that we may see and believe him . " those who were crucified with him insulted him .
when the sixth hour had come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , " Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? " which is , being interpreted , " My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? "
some of those who stood by , when they heard it , said , " behold , he is calling Elijah . "
one ran , and filling a sponge full of vinegar , put it on a Reed , and gave it to him to drink , saying , " Let him be . let 's see whether Elijah comes to take him down . "
Jesus cried out with a loud voice , and gave up the spirit .
the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom .
when the centurion , who stood by opposite him , saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last , he said , " Truly this man was the Son of God ! "
there were also women watching from afar , among whom were both Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ;
who , when he was in Galilee , followed him , and served him ; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem .
Pilate marveled if he were already dead ; and summoning the centurion , he asked him whether he had been dead long .
when he found out from the centurion , he granted the body to Joseph .
he bought a linen cloth , and taking him down , wound him in the linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock . he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .
Mary Magdalene and Mary , the mother of Joses , saw where he was laid .
when the Sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome , bought spices , that they might come and anoint him .
very early on the first day of the week , they came to the tomb when the sun had risen .
they were saying among themselves , " Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us ? "
for it was very big . looking up , they saw that the stone was rolled back .
entering into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , dressed in a white robe , and they were amazed .
he said to them , " Don 't be amazed . you seek Jesus , the Nazarene , who has been crucified . he has risen . he is not here . behold , the place where they laid him !
but go , tell his disciples and Peter , ' He goes before you into Galilee . there you will see him , as he said to you . ' "
they went out , and fled from the tomb , for trembling and astonishment had come on them . they said nothing to anyone ; for they were afraid .
now when he had risen early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons .
she went and told those who had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
when they heard that he was alive , and had been seen by her , they disbelieved .
after these things he was revealed in another form to two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country .
they went away and told it to the rest . they didn 't believe them , either .
afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table , and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they didn 't believe those who had seen him after he had risen .
he said to them , " Go into all the world , and preach the Good News to the whole creation .
he who believes and is baptized will be saved ; but he who disbelieves will be condemned .
so then the Lord , after he had spoken to them , was received up into heaven , and sat down at the right hand of God .
they went out , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word by the signs that followed . Amen .
that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed .
there was in the days of Herod , the king of Judea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the priestly division of Abijah . he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
they were both righteous before God , walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord .
but they had no child , because Elizabeth was barren , and they both were well advanced in years .
now it happened , while he executed the priest 's office before God in the order of his division ,
according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense .
an angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
Zacharias was troubled when he saw him , and fear fell upon him .
but the angel said to him , " Don 't be afraid , Zacharias , because your request has been heard , and your wife , Elizabeth , will bear you a son , and you shall call his name John .
you will have joy and gladness ; and many will rejoice at his birth .
for he will be great in the sight of the Lord , and he will drink no wine nor strong drink . he will be filled with the Holy Spirit , even from his mother 's womb .
he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord , their God .
Zacharias said to the angel , " How can I be sure of this ? for I am an old man , and my wife is well advanced in years . "
the angel answered him , " I am Gabriel , who stands in the presence of God . I was sent to speak to you , and to bring you this good news .
behold , you will be silent and not able to speak , until the day that these things will happen , because you didn 't believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their proper time . "
the people were waiting for Zacharias , and they marveled that he delayed in the temple .
when he came out , he could not speak to them , and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple . he continued making signs to them , and remained mute .
it happened , when the days of his service were fulfilled , he departed to his house .
after these days Elizabeth , his wife , conceived , and she hid herself five months , saying ,
" thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me , to take away my reproach among men . "
having come in , the angel said to her , " rejoice , you highly favored one ! the Lord is with you . blessed are you among women ! "
but when she saw him , she was greatly troubled at the saying , and considered what kind of salutation this might be .
the angel said to her , " Don 't be afraid , Mary , for you have found favor with God .
behold , you will conceive in your womb , and bring forth a son , and will call his name ' Jesus . '
he will be great , and will be called the Son of the Most High . the Lord God will give him the throne of his father , David ,
and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever . there will be no end to his Kingdom . "
Mary said to the angel , " How can this be , seeing I am a virgin ? "
the angel answered her , " The Holy Spirit will come on you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you . therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God .
behold , Elizabeth , your relative , also has conceived a son in her old age ; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren .
for everything spoken by God is possible . "
Mary said , " behold , the handmaid of the Lord ; be it to me according to your word . " the angel departed from her .
Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Judah ,
and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth .
why am I so favored , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
for behold , when the voice of your greeting came into my ears , the baby leaped in my womb for joy !
blessed is she who believed , for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord ! "
Mary said , " My soul magnifies the Lord .
for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid . for behold , from now on , all generations will call me blessed .
for he who is mighty has done great things for me . Holy is his name .
his mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him .
he has shown strength with his arm . he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
he has put down princes from their thrones . and has exalted the lowly .
he has filled the hungry with good things . he has sent the rich away empty .
he has given help to Israel , his servant , that he might remember mercy ,
Mary stayed with her about three months , and then returned to her house .
now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled , and she brought forth a son .
her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her , and they rejoiced with her .
it happened on the eighth day , that they came to circumcise the child ; and they would have called him Zacharias , after the name of the father .
his mother answered , " Not so ; but he will be called John . "
they said to her , " There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name . "
they made signs to his father , what he would have him called .
he asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , " His name is John . " they all marveled .
his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue freed , and he spoke , blessing God .
fear came on all who lived around them , and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea .
all who heard them laid them up in their heart , saying , " What then will this child be ? " the hand of the Lord was with him .
his father , Zacharias , was filled with the Holy Spirit , and prophesied , saying ,
" blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , for he has visited and worked redemption for his people ;
to show mercy towards our fathers , to remember his holy Covenant ,
and you , child , will be called a prophet of the Most High , for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways ,
the child was growing , and becoming strong in spirit , and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel .
now it happened in those days , that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled .
this was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria .
all went to enroll themselves , everyone to his own city .
Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David ;
to enroll himself with Mary , who was pledged to be married to him as wife , being pregnant .
there were shepherds in the same country staying in the field , and keeping watch by night over their flock .
behold , an angel of the Lord stood by them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they were terrified .
this is the sign to you : you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth , lying in a feeding trough . "
it happened , when the angels went away from them into the sky , that the shepherds said one to another , " Let 's go to Bethlehem , now , and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has made known to us . "
they came with haste , and found both Mary and Joseph , and the baby was lying in the feeding trough .
when they saw it , they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child .
all who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds .
but Mary kept all these sayings , pondering them in her heart .
the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , just as it was told them .
when eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child , his name was called Jesus , which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled , they brought him up to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord
( as it is written in the law of the Lord , " Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord " ) ,
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , " A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons . "
behold , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon . this man was righteous and devout , looking for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was on him .
it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
" now you are releasing your servant , Master , according to your word , in peace ;
for my eyes have seen your salvation ,
Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him ,
yes , a sword will Pierce through your own soul , that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed . "
coming up at that very hour , she gave thanks to the Lord , and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem .
when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city , Nazareth .
the child was growing , and was becoming strong in spirit , being filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him .
his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover .
when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast ,
when they didn 't find him , they returned to Jerusalem , looking for him .
it happened after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers , both listening to them , and asking them questions .
all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers .
when they saw him , they were astonished , and his mother said to him , " Son , why have you treated us this way ? behold , your father and I were anxiously looking for you . "
he said to them , " Why were you looking for me ? Didn 't you know that I must be in my Father 's house ? "
they didn 't understand the saying which he spoke to them .
and he went down with them , and came to Nazareth . he was subject to them , and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and men .
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene ,
in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John , the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness .
he came into all the region around the Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins .
as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , " The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ' Make ready the way of the Lord . make his paths straight .
every valley will be filled . every mountain and hill will be brought low . the crooked will become straight , and the rough ways smooth .
all flesh will see God 's salvation . ' "
he said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him , " You offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and don 't begin to say among yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father ; ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones !
even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees . every tree therefore that doesn 't bring forth good fruit is cut down , and thrown into the fire . "
the multitudes asked him , " What then must we do ? "
he answered them , " He who has two coats , let him give to him who has none . he who has food , let him do likewise . "
tax collectors also came to be baptized , and they said to him , " Teacher , what must we do ? "
he said to them , " Collect no more than that which is appointed to you . "
as the people were in expectation , and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John , whether perhaps he was the Christ ,
whose fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor , and will gather the wheat into his barn ; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire . "
then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people ,
Jesus himself , when he began to teach , was about thirty years old , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
the son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
the son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Joseph , the son of Judah ,
the son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmodam , the son of ER ,
the son of Jose , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
the son of Simeon , the son of Judah , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonan , the son of Eliakim ,
the son of Melea , the son of Menan , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
the son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of salmon , the son of Nahshon ,
the son of Amminadab , the son of Aram , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
the son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
the son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalaleel , the son of Cainan ,
the son of Enos , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
the devil said to him , " If you are the Son of God , command this stone to become bread . "
Jesus answered him , saying , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . ' "
the devil , leading him up on a high mountain , showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
the devil said to him , " I will give you all this authority , and their glory , for it has been delivered to me ; and I give it to whomever I want .
Jesus answered him , " Get behind me Satan ! for it is written , ' You shall worship the Lord your God , and you shall serve him only . ' "
he led him to Jerusalem , and set him on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , cast yourself down from here ,
for it is written , ' He will put his angels in charge of you , to guard you ; '
and , ' On their hands they will bear you up , lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone . ' "
Jesus answering , said to him , " It has been said , ' You shall not tempt the Lord your God . ' "
when the devil had completed every temptation , he departed from him until another time .
Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee , and news about him spread through all the surrounding area .
he taught in their synagogues , being glorified by all .
he closed the book , gave it back to the attendant , and sat down . the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him .
he began to tell them , " Today , this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing . "
all testified about him , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth , and they said , " Isn 't this Joseph 's son ? "
he said to them , " doubtless you will tell me this parable , ' physician , heal yourself ! whatever we have heard done at Capernaum , do also here in your hometown . ' "
he said , " Most certainly I tell you , no prophet is acceptable in his hometown .
Elijah was sent to none of them , except to Zarephath , in the land of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , yet not one of them was cleansed , except Naaman , the Syrian . "
they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue , as they heard these things .
they rose up , threw him out of the city , and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on , that they might throw him off the cliff .
but he , passing through their midst , went his way .
he came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee . he was teaching them on the Sabbath day ,
and they were astonished at his teaching , for his word was with authority .
Jesus rebuked him , saying , " Be silent , and come out of him ! " when the demon had thrown him down in their midst , he came out of him , having done him no harm .
amazement came on all , and they spoke together , one with another , saying , " What is this word ? for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits , and they come out ! "
news about him went out into every place of the surrounding region .
he rose up from the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . Simon 's mother @-@ in @-@ law was afflicted with a great fever , and they begged him for her .
he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her . immediately she rose up and served them .
when the sun was setting , all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
when it was day , he departed and went into an uninhabited place , and the multitudes looked for him , and came to him , and held on to him , so that he wouldn 't go away from them .
but he said to them , " I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also . for this reason I have been sent . "
he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee .
now it happened , while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God , that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret .
he saw two boats standing by the lake , but the fishermen had gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
he entered into one of the boats , which was Simon 's , and asked him to put out a little from the land . he sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat .
when he had finished speaking , he said to Simon , " Put out into the deep , and let down your nets for a catch . "
Simon answered him , " Master , we worked all night , and took nothing ; but at your word I will let down the net . "
when they had done this , they caught a great multitude of fish , and their net was breaking .
they beckoned to their partners in the other boat , that they should come and help them . they came , and filled both boats , so that they began to sink .
but Simon Peter , when he saw it , fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , " depart from me , for I am a sinful man , Lord . "
for he was amazed , and all who were with him , at the catch of fish which they had caught ;
and so also were James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . Jesus said to Simon , " Don 't be afraid . from now on you will be catching people alive . "
when they had brought their boats to land , they left everything , and followed him .
he stretched out his hand , and touched him , saying , " I want to . be made clean . " immediately the leprosy left him .
he commanded him to tell no one , " But go your way , and show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
but the report concerning him spread much more , and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
but he withdrew himself into the desert , and prayed .
behold , men brought a paralyzed man on a cot , and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus .
not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude , they went up to the housetop , and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus .
seeing their faith , he said to him , " Man , your sins are forgiven you . "
the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , " Who is this that speaks blasphemies ? who can forgive sins , but God alone ? "
but Jesus , perceiving their thoughts , answered them , " Why are you reasoning so in your hearts ?
which is easier to say , ' Your sins are forgiven you ; ' or to say , ' arise and walk ? '
but that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins " ( he said to the paralyzed man ) , " I tell you , arise , and take up your cot , and go to your house . "
immediately he rose up before them , and took up that which he was laying on , and departed to his house , glorifying God .
amazement took hold on all , and they glorified God . they were filled with fear , saying , " We have seen strange things today . "
after these things he went out , and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office , and said to him , " Follow me ! "
he left everything , and rose up and followed him .
Levi made a great feast for him in his house . there was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them .
their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , " Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners ? "
Jesus answered them , " Those who are healthy have no need for a physician , but those who are sick do .
I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . "
they said to him , " Why do John 's disciples often fast and pray , likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees , but yours eat and drink ? "
he said to them , " Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them . then they will fast in those days . "
he also told a parable to them . " no one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment , or else he will tear the new , and also the piece from the new will not match the old .
no one puts new wine into old wineskins , or else the new wine will burst the skins , and it will be spilled , and the skins will be destroyed .
but new wine must be put into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved .
no man having drunk old wine immediately desires new , for he says , ' The old is better . ' "
now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first , that he was going through the grain fields . his disciples plucked the heads of grain , and ate , rubbing them in their hands .
but some of the Pharisees said to them , " Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day ? "
Jesus , answering them , said , " haven 't you read what David did when he was hungry , he , and those who were with him ;
how he entered into God 's house , and took and ate the show bread , and gave also to those who were with him , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone ? "
he said to them , " The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath . "
it also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught . there was a man there , and his right hand was withered .
the scribes and the Pharisees watched him , to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath , that they might find an accusation against him .
but he knew their thoughts ; and he said to the man who had the withered hand , " Rise up , and stand in the middle . " he arose and stood .
then Jesus said to them , " I will ask you something : is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to kill ? "
he looked around at them all , and said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " he did , and his hand was restored as sound as the other .
but they were filled with rage , and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus .
it happened in these days , that he went out to the mountain to pray , and he continued all night in prayer to God .
as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits , and they were being healed .
all the multitude sought to touch him , for power came out from him and healed them all .
he lifted up his eyes to his disciples , and said , " blessed are you who are poor , for yours is the Kingdom of God .
blessed are you who hunger now , for you will be filled . blessed are you who weep now , for you will laugh .
blessed are you when men shall hate you , and when they shall exclude and mock you , and throw out your name as evil , for the Son of Man 's sake .
rejoice in that day , and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven , for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets .
" but woe to you who are rich ! for you have received your consolation .
Woe to you , you who are full now , for you will be hungry . Woe to you who laugh now , for you will mourn and weep .
Woe , when men speak well of you , for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets .
to him who strikes you on the cheek , offer also the other ; and from him who takes away your cloak , don 't withhold your coat also .
give to everyone who asks you , and don 't ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again .
" as you would like people to do to you , do exactly so to them .
if you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? for even sinners love those who love them .
if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is that to you ? for even sinners do the same .
if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive , what credit is that to you ? even sinners lend to sinners , to receive back as much .
therefore be merciful , even as your Father is also merciful .
Don 't judge , and you won 't be judged . Don 't condemn , and you won 't be condemned . set free , and you will be set free .
" give , and it will be given to you : good measure , pressed down , shaken together , and running over , will be given to you . for with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you . "
he spoke a parable to them . " can the blind guide the blind ? won 't they both fall into a pit ?
a disciple is not above his teacher , but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher .
why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother 's eye , but don 't consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
for there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit ; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit .
for each tree is known by its own fruit . for people don 't gather figs from thorns , nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush .
the good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good , and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil , for out of the abundance of the heart , his mouth speaks .
" why do you call me , ' Lord , Lord , ' and don 't do the things which I say ?
everyone who comes to me , and hears my words , and does them , I will show you who he is like .
after he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people , he entered into Capernaum .
a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear to him , was sick and at the point of death .
when he heard about Jesus , he sent to him elders of the Jews , asking him to come and save his servant .
when they came to Jesus , they begged him earnestly , saying , " He is worthy for you to do this for him ,
for he loves our nation , and he built our synagogue for us . "
therefore I didn 't even think myself worthy to come to you ; but say the word , and my servant will be healed .
when Jesus heard these things , he marveled at him , and turned and said to the multitude who followed him , " I tell you , I have not found such great faith , no , not in Israel . "
those who were sent , returning to the house , found that the servant who had been sick was well .
it happened soon afterwards , that he went to a city called Nain . many of his disciples , along with a great multitude , went with him .
now when he drew near to the gate of the city , behold , one who was dead was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . many people of the city were with her .
when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said to her , " Don 't cry . "
he came near and touched the coffin , and the bearers stood still . he said , " Young man , I tell you , arise ! "
he who was dead sat up , and began to speak . and he gave him to his mother .
fear took hold of all , and they glorified God , saying , " A great prophet has arisen among us ! " and , " God has visited his people ! "
this report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea , and in all the surrounding region .
when the men had come to him , they said , " John the Baptizer has sent us to you , saying , ' Are you he who comes , or should we look for another ? ' "
in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits ; and to many who were blind he gave sight .
blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me . "
when John 's messengers had departed , he began to tell the multitudes about John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? a Reed shaken by the wind ?
but what did you go out to see ? a man clothed in soft clothing ? behold , those who are gorgeously dressed , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
but what did you go out to see ? a prophet ? yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet .
this is he of whom it is written , ' behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
" for I tell you , among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer , yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he . "
when all the people and the tax collectors heard this , they declared God to be just , having been baptized with John 's baptism .
but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God , not being baptized by him themselves .
" to what then will I liken the people of this generation ? what are they like ?
they are like children who sit in the marketplace , and call one to another , saying , ' We piped to you , and you didn 't dance . we mourned , and you didn 't weep . '
for John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ' He has a demon . '
the Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ' behold , a gluttonous man , and a drunkard ; a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! '
wisdom is justified by all her children . "
one of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him . he entered into the Pharisee 's house , and sat at the table .
now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it , he said to himself , " This man , if he were a prophet , would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him , that she is a sinner . "
Jesus answered him , " Simon , I have something to tell you . " he said , " Teacher , say on . "
" a certain lender had two debtors . the one owed five hundred denarii , and the other fifty .
when they couldn 't pay , he forgave them both . which of them therefore will love him most ? "
Simon answered , " He , I suppose , to whom he forgave the most . " he said to him , " You have judged correctly . "
you gave me no kiss , but she , since the time I came in , has not ceased to kiss my feet .
you didn 't anoint my head with oil , but she has anointed my feet with ointment .
therefore I tell you , her sins , which are many , are forgiven , for she loved much . but to whom little is forgiven , the same loves little . "
he said to her , " Your sins are forgiven . "
those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves , " Who is this who even forgives sins ? "
he said to the woman , " Your faith has saved you . go in peace . "
it happened soon afterwards , that he went about through cities and villages , preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God . with him were the twelve ,
other seed fell on the rock , and as soon as it grew , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
other fell amid the thorns , and the thorns grew with it , and choked it .
other fell into the good ground , and grew , and brought forth fruit one hundred times . " as he said these things , he called out , " He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! "
now the parable is this : the seed is the word of God .
those along the road are those who hear , then the devil comes , and takes away the word from their heart , that they may not believe and be saved .
those on the rock are they who , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; but these have no root , who believe for a while , then fall away in time of temptation .
that which fell among the thorns , these are those who have heard , and as they go on their way they are choked with cares , riches , and pleasures of life , and bring no fruit to maturity .
that in the good ground , these are such as in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , hold it tightly , and bring forth fruit with patience .
" no one , when he has lit a lamp , covers it with a container , or puts it under a bed ; but puts it on a stand , that those who enter in may see the light .
for nothing is hidden , that will not be revealed ; nor anything secret , that will not be known and come to light .
be careful therefore how you hear . for whoever has , to him will be given ; and whoever doesn 't have , from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has . "
his mother and brothers came to him , and they could not come near him for the crowd .
it was told him by some saying , " Your mother and your brothers stand outside , desiring to see you . "
but he answered them , " My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God , and do it . "
now it happened on one of those days , that he entered into a boat , himself and his disciples , and he said to them , " Let 's go over to the other side of the lake . " so they launched out .
but as they sailed , he fell asleep . a wind storm came down on the lake , and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water .
they came to him , and awoke him , saying , " Master , master , we are dying ! " he awoke , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water , and they ceased , and it was calm .
they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is opposite Galilee .
when Jesus stepped ashore , a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him . he wore no clothes , and didn 't live in a house , but in the tombs .
Jesus asked him , " What is your name ? " he said , " Legion , " for many demons had entered into him .
they begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss .
now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain , and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those . he allowed them .
the demons came out from the man , and entered into the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake , and were drowned .
when those who fed them saw what had happened , they fled , and told it in the city and in the country .
those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed .
all the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them , for they were very much afraid . he entered into the boat , and returned .
it happened , when Jesus returned , that the multitude welcomed him , for they were all waiting for him .
behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue . he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and begged him to come into his house ,
for he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . but as he went , the multitudes pressed against him .
a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years , who had spent all her living on physicians , and could not be healed by any ,
came behind him , and touched the fringe of his cloak , and immediately the flow of her blood stopped .
Jesus said , " Who touched me ? " when all denied it , Peter and those with him said , " Master , the multitudes press and jostle you , and you say , ' Who touched me ? ' "
but Jesus said , " Someone did touch me , for I perceived that power has gone out of me . "
when the woman saw that she was not hidden , she came trembling , and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
he said to her , " Daughter , cheer up . your faith has made you well . go in peace . "
while he still spoke , one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house came , saying to him , " Your daughter is dead . Don 't trouble the Teacher . "
but Jesus hearing it , answered him , " Don 't be afraid . only believe , and she will be healed . "
when he came to the house , he didn 't allow anyone to enter in , except Peter , John , James , the father of the child , and her mother .
all were weeping and mourning her , but he said , " Don 't weep . she isn 't dead , but sleeping . "
they were ridiculing him , knowing that she was dead .
but he put them all outside , and taking her by the hand , he called , saying , " Child , arise ! "
her spirit returned , and she rose up immediately . he commanded that something be given to her to eat .
her parents were amazed , but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done .
he called the twelve together , and gave them power and authority over all demons , and to cure diseases .
he sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
he said to them , " Take nothing for your journey--neither staffs , nor wallet , nor bread , nor money ; neither have two coats apiece .
into whatever house you enter , stay there , and depart from there .
as many as don 't receive you , when you depart from that city , shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them . "
they departed , and went throughout the villages , preaching the Good News , and healing everywhere .
Herod said , " John I beheaded , but who is this , about whom I hear such things ? " he sought to see him .
the Apostles , when they had returned , told him what things they had done . he took them , and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida .
but the multitudes , perceiving it , followed him . he welcomed them , and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God , and he cured those who needed healing .
for they were about five thousand men . he said to his disciples , " Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each . "
they did so , and made them all sit down .
he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to the sky , he blessed them , and broke them , and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude .
they ate , and were all filled . they gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over .
it happened , as he was praying alone , that the disciples were with him , and he asked them , " Who do the multitudes say that I am ? "
they answered , " ' John the Baptizer , ' but others say , ' Elijah , ' and others , that one of the old prophets is risen again . "
he said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " The Christ of God . "
but he warned them , and commanded them to tell this to no one ,
saying , " The Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . "
he said to all , " If anyone desires to come after me , let him deny himself , take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever desires to save his life will lose it , but whoever will lose his life for my sake , the same will save it .
for what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world , and loses or forfeits his own self ?
for whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be ashamed , when he comes in his glory , and the glory of the Father , and of the holy angels .
but I tell you the truth : there are some of those who stand here , who will in no way taste of death , until they see the Kingdom of God . "
it happened about eight days after these sayings , that he took with him Peter , John , and James , and went up onto the mountain to pray .
as he was praying , the appearance of his face was altered , and his clothing became white and dazzling .
behold , two men were talking with him , who were Moses and Elijah ,
now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep , but when they were fully awake , they saw his glory , and the two men who stood with him .
while he said these things , a cloud came and overshadowed them , and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud .
a voice came out of the cloud , saying , " This is my beloved Son . listen to him ! "
when the voice came , Jesus was found alone . they were silent , and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen .
it happened on the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , that a great multitude met him .
behold , a man from the crowd called out , saying , " Teacher , I beg you to look at my son , for he is my only child .
behold , a spirit takes him , he suddenly cries out , and it convulses him so that he foams , and it hardly departs from him , bruising him severely .
I begged your disciples to cast it out , and they couldn 't . "
Jesus answered , " Faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you and bear with you ? bring your son here . "
while he was still coming , the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently . but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
but they didn 't understand this saying . it was concealed from them , that they should not perceive it , and they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
there arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest .
John answered , " Master , we saw someone casting out demons in your name , and we forbade him , because he doesn 't follow with us . "
Jesus said to him , " Don 't forbid him , for he who is not against us is for us . "
it came to pass , when the days were near that he should be taken up , he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
and sent messengers before his face . they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , so as to prepare for him .
they didn 't receive him , because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem .
when his disciples , James and John , saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky , and destroy them , just as Elijah did ? "
but he turned and rebuked them , " You don 't know of what kind of spirit you are .
for the Son of Man didn 't come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . " they went to another village .
as they went on the way , a certain man said to him , " I want to follow you wherever you go , Lord . "
Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
he said to another , " Follow me ! " but he said , " Lord , allow me first to go and bury my father . "
but Jesus said to him , " Leave the dead to bury their own dead , but you go and announce the Kingdom of God . "
another also said , " I want to follow you , Lord , but first allow me to say good @-@ bye to those who are at my house . "
but Jesus said to him , " No one , having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , is fit for the Kingdom of God . "
now after these things , the Lord also appointed seventy others , and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place , where he was about to come .
then he said to them , " The harvest is indeed plentiful , but the laborers are few . pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest , that he may send out laborers into his harvest .
go your ways . behold , I send you out as lambs among wolves .
carry no purse , nor wallet , nor sandals . greet no one on the way .
into whatever house you enter , first say , ' Peace be to this house . '
if a son of peace is there , your peace will rest on him ; but if not , it will return to you .
remain in that same house , eating and drinking the things they give , for the laborer is worthy of his wages . Don 't go from house to house .
into whatever city you enter , and they receive you , eat the things that are set before you .
heal the sick who are therein , and tell them , ' The Kingdom of God has come near to you . '
I tell you , it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city .
" Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
but it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you .
you , Capernaum , who are exalted to heaven , will be brought down to Hades .
whoever listens to you listens to me , and whoever rejects you rejects me . whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me . "
the seventy returned with joy , saying , " Lord , even the demons are subject to us in your name ! "
he said to them , " I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven .
behold , I give you authority to tread on Serpents and Scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy . nothing will in any way hurt you .
nevertheless , don 't rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . "
turning to the disciples , he said , " All things have been delivered to me by my Father . no one knows who the Son is , except the Father , and who the Father is , except the Son , and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him . "
turning to the disciples , he said privately , " blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see ,
for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them , and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them . "
behold , a certain lawyer stood up and tested him , saying , " Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? "
he said to him , " What is written in the law ? how do you read it ? "
he answered , " You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your strength , and with all your mind ; and your neighbor as yourself . "
he said to him , " You have answered correctly . do this , and you will live . "
but he , desiring to justify himself , asked Jesus , " Who is my neighbor ? "
Jesus answered , " A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he fell among robbers , who both stripped him and beat him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
by chance a certain priest was going down that way . when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
in the same way a Levite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side .
but a certain Samaritan , as he traveled , came where he was . when he saw him , he was moved with compassion ,
came to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring on oil and wine . he set him on his own animal , and brought him to an Inn , and took care of him .
on the next day , when he departed , he took out two denarii , and gave them to the host , and said to him , ' Take care of him . whatever you spend beyond that , I will repay you when I return . '
now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers ? "
he said , " He who showed mercy on him . " then Jesus said to him , " Go and do likewise . "
it happened as they went on their way , he entered into a certain village , and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
she had a sister called Mary , who also sat at Jesus ' feet , and heard his word .
Jesus answered her , " Martha , Martha , you are anxious and troubled about many things ,
but one thing is needed . Mary has chosen the good part , which will not be taken away from her . "
it happened , that when he finished praying in a certain place , one of his disciples said to him , " Lord , teach us to pray , just as John also taught his disciples . "
he said to them , " When you pray , say , ' Our Father in heaven , may your name be kept holy . May your Kingdom come . May your will be done on earth , as it is in heaven .
give us day by day our daily bread .
forgive us our sins , for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us . bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . ' "
I tell you , although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend , yet because of his persistence , he will get up and give him as many as he needs .
" I tell you , keep asking , and it will be given you . keep seeking , and you will find . keep knocking , and it will be opened to you .
for everyone who asks receives . he who seeks finds . to him who knocks it will be opened .
" which of you fathers , if your son asks for bread , will give him a stone ? or if he asks for a fish , he won 't give him a snake instead of a fish , will he ?
or if he asks for an egg , he won 't give him a scorpion , will he ?
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ? "
he was casting out a demon , and it was mute . it happened , when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke ; and the multitudes marveled .
but some of them said , " He casts out demons by Beelzebul , the prince of the demons . "
others , testing him , sought from him a sign from heaven .
but he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation . a house divided against itself falls .
if Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? for you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul .
but if I cast out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your children cast them out ? therefore will they be your judges .
but if I by the finger of God cast out demons , then the Kingdom of God has come to you .
" when the strong man , fully armed , guards his own dwelling , his goods are safe .
but when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him , he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted , and divides his spoils .
" he that is not with me is against me . he who doesn 't gather with me scatters .
the unclean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through dry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house from which I came out . '
when he returns , he finds it swept and put in order .
then he goes , and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself , and they enter in and dwell there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . "
it came to pass , as he said these things , a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice , and said to him , " blessed is the womb that bore you , and the breasts which nursed you ! "
but he said , " On the contrary , blessed are those who hear the word of God , and keep it . "
for even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so will also the Son of Man be to this generation .
the men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation , and will condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , one greater than Jonah is here .
" no one , when he has lit a lamp , puts it in a cellar or under a basket , but on a stand , that those who come in may see the light .
the lamp of the body is the eye . therefore when your eye is good , your whole body is also full of light ; but when it is evil , your body also is full of darkness .
therefore see whether the light that is in you isn 't darkness .
if therefore your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wholly full of light , as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light . "
now as he spoke , a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him . he went in , and sat at the table .
when the Pharisee saw it , he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner .
the Lord said to him , " Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter , but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness .
you foolish ones , didn 't he who made the outside make the inside also ?
but give for gifts to the needy those things which are within , and behold , all things will be clean to you .
Woe to you Pharisees ! for you love the best seats in the synagogues , and the greetings in the marketplaces .
Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you are like hidden graves , and the men who walk over them don 't know it . "
one of the lawyers answered him , " Teacher , in saying this you insult us also . "
Woe to you ! for you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
so you testify and consent to the works of your fathers . for they killed them , and you build their tombs .
therefore also the wisdom of God said , ' I will send to them prophets and Apostles ; and some of them they will kill and persecute ,
Woe to you lawyers ! for you took away the key of knowledge . you didn 't enter in yourselves , and those who were entering in , you hindered . "
as he said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry , and to draw many things out of him ;
lying in wait for him , and seeking to catch him in something he might say , that they might accuse him .
meanwhile , when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together , so much so that they trampled on each other , he began to tell his disciples first of all , " beware of the yeast of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
but there is nothing covered up , that will not be revealed , nor hidden , that will not be known .
therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light . what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops .
" I tell you , my friends , don 't be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
but I will warn you whom you should fear . fear him , who after he has killed , has power to cast into Gehenna . yes , I tell you , fear him .
" Aren 't five sparrows sold for two assaria coins ? not one of them is forgotten by God .
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered . therefore don 't be afraid . you are of more value than many sparrows .
" I tell you , everyone who confesses me before men , him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God ;
but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God .
everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
when they bring you before the synagogues , the rulers , and the authorities , don 't be anxious how or what you will answer , or what you will say ;
for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say . "
one of the multitude said to him , " Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me . "
but he said to him , " Man , who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you ? "
he said to them , " beware ! keep yourselves from covetousness , for a man 's life doesn 't consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses . "
he spoke a parable to them , saying , " The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly .
he reasoned within himself , saying , ' What will I do , because I don 't have room to store my crops ? '
he said , ' This is what I will do . I will pull down my barns , and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
I will tell my soul , " Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years . take your ease , eat , drink , be merry . " '
" but God said to him , ' You foolish one , tonight your soul is required of you . the things which you have prepared--whose will they be ? '
so is he who lays up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God . "
he said to his disciples , " Therefore I tell you , don 't be anxious for your life , what you will eat , nor yet for your body , what you will wear .
life is more than food , and the body is more than clothing .
consider the ravens : they don 't sow , they don 't reap , they have no warehouse or barn , and God feeds them . how much more valuable are you than birds !
which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height ?
if then you aren 't able to do even the least things , why are you anxious about the rest ?
consider the lilies , how they grow . they don 't toil , neither do they spin ; yet I tell you , even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
but if this is how God clothes the grass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , O you of little faith ?
Don 't seek what you will eat or what you will drink ; neither be anxious .
for the nations of the world seek after all of these things , but your Father knows that you need these things .
but seek God 's Kingdom , and all these things will be added to you .
Don 't be afraid , little flock , for it is your Father 's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom .
sell that which you have , and give gifts to the needy . make for yourselves purses which don 't grow old , a treasure in the heavens that doesn 't fail , where no thief approaches , neither moth destroys .
for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
" let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning .
be like men watching for their lord , when he returns from the marriage feast ; that , when he comes and knocks , they may immediately open to him .
blessed are those servants , whom the lord will find watching when he comes . most certainly I tell you , that he will dress himself , and make them recline , and will come and serve them .
they will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch , and finds them so .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not allowed his house to be broken into .
therefore be ready also , for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don 't expect him . "
Peter said to him , " Lord , are you telling this parable to us , or to everybody ? "
the Lord said , " Who then is the faithful and wise steward , whom his lord will set over his household , to give them their portion of food at the right times ?
blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes .
truly I tell you , that he will set him over all that he has .
that servant , who knew his lord 's will , and didn 't prepare , nor do what he wanted , will be beaten with many stripes ,
but he who didn 't know , and did things worthy of stripes , will be beaten with few stripes . to whomever much is given , of him will much be required ; and to whom much was entrusted , of him more will be asked .
" I came to throw fire on the earth . I wish it were already kindled .
but I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how distressed I am until it is accomplished !
do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth ? I tell you , no , but rather division .
for from now on , there will be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
they will be divided , father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against her mother ; mother @-@ in @-@ law against her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , and daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law . "
he said to the multitudes also , " When you see a cloud rising from the west , immediately you say , ' A shower is coming , ' and so it happens .
when a south wind blows , you say , ' There will be a scorching heat , ' and it happens .
you hypocrites ! you know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky , but how is it that you don 't interpret this time ?
why don 't you judge for yourselves what is right ?
I tell you , you will by no means get out of there , until you have paid the very last penny . "
now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans , whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices .
Jesus answered them , " Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans , because they suffered such things ?
I tell you , no , but unless you repent , you will all perish in the same way .
or those Eighteen , on whom the tower in Siloam fell , and killed them ; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem ?
I tell you , no , but , unless you repent , you will all perish in the same way . "
he spoke this parable . " a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit on it , and found none .
he said to the vine dresser , ' behold , these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree , and found none . cut it down . why does it waste the soil ? '
he answered , ' Lord , leave it alone this year also , until I dig around it , and fertilize it .
if it bears fruit , fine ; but if not , after that , you can cut it down . ' "
he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day .
behold , there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity Eighteen years , and she was bent over , and could in no way straighten herself up .
when Jesus saw her , he called her , and said to her , " Woman , you are freed from your infirmity . "
he laid his hands on her , and immediately she stood up straight , and glorified God .
therefore the Lord answered him , " You hypocrites ! Doesn 't each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath , and lead him away to water ?
ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan had bound Eighteen long years , be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day ? "
as he said these things , all his adversaries were disappointed , and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
he said , " What is the Kingdom of God like ? to what shall I compare it ?
it is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and put in his own garden . it grew , and became a large tree , and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches . "
again he said , " To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God ?
it is like yeast , which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour , until it was all leavened . "
he went on his way through cities and villages , teaching , and traveling on to Jerusalem .
then you will begin to say , ' We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets . '
he will say , ' I tell you , I don 't know where you come from . depart from me , all you workers of iniquity . '
they will come from the east , west , north , and south , and will sit down in the Kingdom of God .
behold , there are some who are last who will be first , and there are some who are first who will be last . "
on that same day , some Pharisees came , saying to him , " Get out of here , and go away , for Herod wants to kill you . "
he said to them , " Go and tell that Fox , ' behold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third day I complete my mission .
nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day , for it can 't be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem . '
behold , your house is left to you desolate . I tell you , you will not see me , until you say , ' blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ' "
it happened , when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread , that they were watching him .
behold , a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him .
Jesus , answering , spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , " Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? "
but they were silent . he took him , and healed him , and let him go .
he answered them , " Which of you , if your son or an ox fell into a well , wouldn 't immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day ? "
they couldn 't answer him regarding these things .
for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . "
but when you make a feast , ask the poor , the maimed , the lame , or the blind ;
and you will be blessed , because they don 't have the resources to repay you . for you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous . "
when one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things , he said to him , " blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God ! "
but he said to him , " A certain man made a great Supper , and he invited many people .
he sent out his servant at Supper time to tell those who were invited , ' Come , for everything is ready now . '
they all as one began to make excuses . " the first said to him , ' I have bought a field , and I must go and see it . please have me excused . '
" another said , ' I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I must go try them out . please have me excused . '
" another said , ' I have married a wife , and therefore I can 't come . '
" the servant said , ' Lord , it is done as you commanded , and there is still room . '
" the lord said to the servant , ' Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
for I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my Supper . ' "
whoever doesn 't bear his own cross , and come after me , can 't be my disciple .
or perhaps , when he has laid a foundation , and is not able to finish , everyone who sees begins to mock him ,
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sends an envoy , and asks for conditions of peace .
so therefore whoever of you who doesn 't renounce all that he has , he can 't be my disciple .
salt is good , but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless , with what do you season it ?
it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile . it is thrown out . he who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him .
the Pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying , " This man welcomes sinners , and eats with them . "
when he has found it , he carries it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents , than over ninety @-@ nine righteous people who need no repentance .
or what woman , if she had ten drachma coins , if she lost one drachma coin , wouldn 't light a lamp , sweep the house , and seek diligently until she found it ?
when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ' rejoice with me , for I have found the drachma which I had lost . '
even so , I tell you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting . "
he said , " A certain man had two sons .
the younger of them said to his father , ' Father , give me my share of your property . ' he divided his livelihood between them .
not many days after , the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country . there he wasted his property with riotous living .
when he had spent all of it , there arose a severe famine in that country , and he began to be in need .
he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country , and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs .
he wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate , but no one gave him any .
but when he came to himself he said , ' How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough to spare , and I 'm dying with hunger !
I will get up and go to my father , and will tell him , " Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in your sight .
I am no more worthy to be called your son . make me as one of your hired servants . " '
" he arose , and came to his father . but while he was still far off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
the son said to him , ' Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in your sight . I am no longer worthy to be called your son . '
" but the father said to his servants , ' Bring out the best robe , and put it on him . put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet .
bring the fattened calf , kill it , and let us eat , and celebrate ;
for this , my son , was dead , and is alive again . he was lost , and is found . ' they began to celebrate .
" now his elder son was in the field . as he came near to the house , he heard music and dancing .
he called one of the servants to him , and asked what was going on .
he said to him , ' Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fattened calf , because he has received him back safe and healthy . '
but when this , your son , came , who has devoured your living with prostitutes , you killed the fattened calf for him . '
" he said to him , ' Son , you are always with me , and all that is mine is yours .
but it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad , for this , your brother , was dead , and is alive again . he was lost , and is found . ' "
he also said to his disciples , " There was a certain rich man who had a manager . an accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions .
he called him , and said to him , ' What is this that I hear about you ? give an accounting of your management , for you can no longer be manager . '
" the manager said within himself , ' What will I do , seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me ? I don 't have strength to dig . I am ashamed to beg .
I know what I will do , so that when I am removed from management , they may receive me into their houses . '
calling each one of his lord 's debtors to him , he said to the first , ' How much do you owe to my lord ? '
he said , ' A hundred batos of oil . ' he said to him , ' Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty . '
then he said to another , ' How much do you owe ? ' he said , ' A hundred cors of wheat . ' he said to him , ' Take your bill , and write eighty . '
" his lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely , for the children of this world are , in their own generation , wiser than the children of the light .
he who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much . he who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much .
if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
if you have not been faithful in that which is another 's , who will give you that which is your own ?
the Pharisees , who were lovers of money , also heard all these things , and they scoffed at him .
he said to them , " You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men , but God knows your hearts . for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God .
the law and the prophets were until John . from that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached , and everyone is forcing his way into it .
but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall .
everyone who divorces his wife , and marries another , commits adultery . he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery .
" now there was a certain rich man , and he was clothed in purple and fine linen , living in luxury every day .
it happened that the beggar died , and that he was carried away by the angels to Abraham 's bosom . the rich man also died , and was buried .
in Hades , he lifted up his eyes , being in torment , and saw Abraham far off , and Lazarus at his bosom .
he cried and said , ' Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ! for I am in anguish in this flame . '
besides all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed , that those who want to pass from here to you are not able , and that none may cross over from there to us . '
" he said , ' I ask you therefore , father , that you would send him to my father 's house ;
for I have five brothers , that he may testify to them , so they won 't also come into this place of torment . '
" but Abraham said to him , ' They have Moses and the prophets . let them listen to them . '
" he said , ' No , father Abraham , but if one goes to them from the dead , they will repent . '
" he said to him , ' If they don 't listen to Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead . ' "
he said to the disciples , " It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come , but woe to him through whom they come !
it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble .
be careful . if your brother sins against you , rebuke him . if he repents , forgive him .
if he sins against you seven times in the day , and seven times returns , saying , ' I repent , ' you shall forgive him . "
the Apostles said to the Lord , " Increase our faith . "
the Lord said , " If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed , you would tell this sycamore tree , ' Be uprooted , and be planted in the sea , ' and it would obey you .
but who is there among you , having a servant plowing or keeping sheep , that will say , when he comes in from the field , ' Come immediately and sit down at the table , '
and will not rather tell him , ' Prepare my Supper , clothe yourself properly , and serve me , while I eat and drink . afterward you shall eat and drink ' ?
does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded ? I think not .
even so you also , when you have done all the things that are commanded you , say , ' We are unworthy servants . we have done our duty . ' "
it happened as he was on his way to Jerusalem , that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee .
as he entered into a certain village , ten men who were lepers met him , who stood at a distance .
when he saw them , he said to them , " Go and show yourselves to the priests . " it happened that as they went , they were cleansed .
one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , glorifying God with a loud voice .
Jesus answered , " Weren 't the ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
were there none found who returned to give glory to God , except this stranger ? "
then he said to him , " Get up , and go your way . your faith has healed you . "
being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come , he answered them , " The Kingdom of God doesn 't come with observation ;
neither will they say , ' Look , here ! ' or , ' Look , there ! ' for behold , the Kingdom of God is within you . "
he said to the disciples , " The days will come , when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
they will tell you , ' Look , here ! ' or ' Look , there ! ' Don 't go away , nor follow after them ,
for as the lightning , when it flashes out of the one part under the sky , shines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
but first , he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
as it happened in the days of Noah , even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man .
they ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise , even as it happened in the days of lot : they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ;
but in the day that lot went out from Sodom , it rained fire and sulfur from the sky , and destroyed them all .
it will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed .
in that day , he who will be on the housetop , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away . let him who is in the field likewise not turn back .
remember lot 's wife !
whoever seeks to save his life loses it , but whoever loses his life preserves it .
I tell you , in that night there will be two people in one bed . the one will be taken , and the other will be left .
there will be two grinding grain together . one will be taken , and the other will be left . "
they , answering , asked him , " Where , Lord ? " he said to them , " Where the body is , there will the vultures also be gathered together . "
a widow was in that city , and she often came to him , saying , ' defend me from my adversary ! '
the Lord said , " listen to what the unrighteous judge says .
won 't God avenge his chosen ones , who are crying out to him day and night , and yet he exercises patience with them ?
I tell you that he will avenge them quickly . nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on the earth ? "
I fast twice a week . I give tithes of all that I get . '
but the tax collector , standing far away , wouldn 't even lift up his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ' God , be merciful to me , a sinner ! '
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be exalted . "
they were also bringing their babies to him , that he might touch them . but when the disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
Jesus summoned them , saying , " allow the little children to come to me , and don 't hinder them , for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
most certainly , I tell you , whoever doesn 't receive the Kingdom of God like a little child , he will in no way enter into it . "
a certain ruler asked him , saying , " Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? "
Jesus asked him , " Why do you call me good ? no one is good , except one--God .
you know the commandments : ' Don 't commit adultery , ' ' Don 't murder , ' ' Don 't steal , ' ' Don 't give false testimony , ' ' honor your father and your mother . ' "
he said , " I have observed all these things from my youth up . "
but when he heard these things , he became very sad , for he was very rich .
Jesus , seeing that he became very sad , said , " How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God !
for it is easier for a Camel to enter in through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
those who heard it said , " Then who can be saved ? "
but he said , " The things which are impossible with men are possible with God . "
Peter said , " Look , we have left everything , and followed you . "
he took the twelve aside , and said to them , " behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
they understood none of these things . this saying was hidden from them , and they didn 't understand the things that were said .
it happened , as he came near Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the road , begging .
hearing a multitude going by , he asked what this meant .
they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by .
he cried out , " Jesus , you son of David , have mercy on me ! "
those who led the way rebuked him , that he should be quiet ; but he cried out all the more , " You son of David , have mercy on me ! "
Jesus said to him , " Receive your sight . your faith has healed you . "
immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God . all the people , when they saw it , praised God .
he entered and was passing through Jericho .
there was a man named Zacchaeus . he was a chief tax collector , and he was rich .
he was trying to see who Jesus was , and couldn 't because of the crowd , because he was short .
he ran on ahead , and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him , for he was to pass that way .
when Jesus came to the place , he looked up and saw him , and said to him , " Zacchaeus , hurry and come down , for today I must stay at your house . "
he hurried , came down , and received him joyfully .
when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , " He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner . "
Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord , " behold , Lord , half of my goods I give to the poor . if I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone , I restore four times as much . "
Jesus said to him , " Today , salvation has come to this house , because he also is a son of Abraham .
for the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost . "
as they heard these things , he went on and told a parable , because he was near Jerusalem , and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately .
he said therefore , " A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
he called ten servants of his , and gave them ten Mina coins , and told them , ' Conduct business until I come . '
" it happened when he had come back again , having received the kingdom , that he commanded these servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know what they had gained by conducting business .
the first came before him , saying , ' Lord , your Mina has made ten more minas . '
" he said to him , ' Well done , you good servant ! because you were found faithful with very little , you shall have authority over ten cities . '
" the second came , saying , ' Your Mina , Lord , has made five minas . '
" so he said to him , ' And you are to be over five cities . '
another came , saying , ' Lord , behold , your Mina , which I kept laid away in a handkerchief ,
for I feared you , because you are an exacting man . you take up that which you didn 't lay down , and reap that which you didn 't sow . '
then why didn 't you deposit my money in the bank , and at my coming , I might have earned interest on it ? '
he said to those who stood by , ' Take the Mina away from him , and give it to him who has the ten minas . '
'For I tell you that to everyone who has , will more be given ; but from him who doesn 't have , even that which he has will be taken away from him .
but bring those enemies of mine who didn 't want me to reign over them here , and kill them before me . ' "
having said these things , he went on ahead , going up to Jerusalem .
if anyone asks you , ' Why are you untying it ? ' say to him : ' the Lord needs it . ' "
those who were sent went away , and found things just as he had told them .
as they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , " Why are you untying the colt ? "
they said , " The Lord needs it . "
they brought it to Jesus . they threw their cloaks on the colt , and set Jesus on them .
as he went , they spread their cloaks in the way .
saying , " blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! peace in heaven , and glory in the highest ! "
some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him , " Teacher , rebuke your disciples ! "
he answered them , " I tell you that if these were silent , the stones would cry out . "
when he drew near , he saw the city and wept over it ,
saying , " If you , even you , had known today the things which belong to your peace ! but now , they are hidden from your eyes .
for the days will come on you , when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you , surround you , hem you in on every side ,
and will dash you and your children within you to the ground . they will not leave in you one stone on another , because you didn 't know the time of your visitation . "
he entered into the temple , and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it ,
saying to them , " It is written , ' My house is a house of prayer , ' but you have made it a ' den of robbers ' ! "
it happened on one of those days , as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News , that the priests and scribes came to him with the elders .
they asked him , " Tell us : by what authority do you do these things ? or who is giving you this authority ? "
he answered them , " I also will ask you one question . tell me :
they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will say , ' Why didn 't you believe him ? '
but if we say , ' From men , ' all the people will stone us , for they are persuaded that John was a prophet . "
they answered that they didn 't know where it was from .
Jesus said to them , " Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . "
he began to tell the people this parable . " a man planted a vineyard , and rented it out to some farmers , and went into another country for a long time .
at the proper season , he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard . but the farmers beat him , and sent him away empty .
he sent yet another servant , and they also beat him , and treated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
he sent yet a third , and they also wounded him , and threw him out .
the lord of the vineyard said , ' What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son . it may be that seeing him , they will respect him . '
" but when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . '
they threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them ?
he will come and destroy these farmers , and will give the vineyard to others . " when they heard it , they said , " May it never be ! "
but he looked at them , and said , " Then what is this that is written , ' The stone which the builders rejected , the same was made the chief cornerstone ? '
everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces , but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust . "
the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour , but they feared the people--for they knew he had spoken this parable against them .
but he perceived their craftiness , and said to them , " Why do you test me ?
he said to them , " Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . "
they weren 't able to trap him in his words before the people . they marveled at his answer , and were silent .
there were therefore seven brothers . the first took a wife , and died childless .
the second took her as wife , and he died childless .
afterward the woman also died .
therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be ? for the seven had her as a wife . "
Jesus said to them , " The children of this age marry , and are given in marriage .
but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage .
for they can 't die any more , for they are like the angels , and are children of God , being children of the resurrection .
but that the dead are raised , even Moses showed at the bush , when he called the Lord ' The God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . '
now he is not the God of the dead , but of the living , for all are alive to him . "
some of the scribes answered , " Teacher , you speak well . "
he said to them , " Why do they say that the Christ is David 's son ?
David himself says in the book of Psalms , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " sit at my right hand ,
" David therefore calls him Lord , so how is he his son ? "
who devour widows ' houses , and for a pretense make long prayers : these will receive greater condemnation . "
he looked up , and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury .
for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance , but she , out of her poverty , put in all that she had to live on . "
they asked him , " Teacher , so when will these things be ? what is the sign that these things are about to happen ? "
he said , " Watch out that you don 't get led astray , for many will come in my name , saying , ' I am he , ' and , ' The time is at hand . ' therefore don 't follow them .
when you hear of wars and disturbances , don 't be terrified , for these things must happen first , but the end won 't come immediately . "
then he said to them , " Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
there will be great earthquakes , famines , and plagues in various places . there will be terrors and great signs from heaven .
but before all these things , they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you , delivering you up to synagogues and prisons , bringing you before kings and governors for my name 's sake .
it will turn out as a testimony for you .
settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer ,
for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict .
you will be handed over even by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends . they will cause some of you to be put to death .
you will be hated by all men for my name 's sake .
and not a hair of your head will perish .
" by your endurance you will win your lives .
" but when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then know that its desolation is at hand .
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . let those who are in the midst of her depart . let those who are in the country not enter therein .
for these are days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days ! for there will be great distress in the land , and wrath to this people .
they will fall by the edge of the sword , and will be led captive into all the nations . Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled .
there will be signs in the sun , moon , and stars ; and on the earth anxiety of nations , in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves ;
men fainting for fear , and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world : for the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
but when these things begin to happen , look up , and lift up your heads , because your redemption is near . "
he told them a parable . " see the fig tree , and all the trees .
when they are already budding , you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near .
even so you also , when you see these things happening , know that the Kingdom of God is near .
most certainly I tell you , this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished .
heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will by no means pass away .
therefore be watchful all the time , praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen , and to stand before the Son of Man . "
every day Jesus was teaching in the temple , and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet .
all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him .
now the feast of unleavened bread , which is called the Passover , drew near .
the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death , for they feared the people .
Satan entered into Judas , who was surnamed Iscariot , who was numbered with the twelve .
he went away , and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them .
they were glad , and agreed to give him money .
he consented , and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude .
the day of unleavened bread came , on which the Passover must be sacrificed .
he sent Peter and John , saying , " Go and prepare the Passover for us , that we may eat . "
they said to him , " Where do you want us to prepare ? "
he will show you a large , furnished upper room . make preparations there . "
they went , found things as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover .
for I tell you , I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God . "
he received a cup , and when he had given thanks , he said , " Take this , and share it among yourselves ,
for I tell you , I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine , until the Kingdom of God comes . "
he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and gave to them , saying , " This is my body which is given for you . do this in memory of me . "
likewise , he took the cup after Supper , saying , " This cup is the new Covenant in my blood , which is poured out for you .
but behold , the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table .
the Son of Man indeed goes , as it has been determined , but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed ! "
they began to question among themselves , which of them it was who would do this thing .
there arose also a contention among them , which of them was considered to be greatest .
he said to them , " The kings of the nations lord it over them , and those who have authority over them are called ' benefactors . '
but not so with you . but one who is the greater among you , let him become as the younger , and one who is governing , as one who serves .
for who is greater , one who sits at the table , or one who serves ? Isn 't it he who sits at the table ? but I am in the midst of you as one who serves .
but you are those who have continued with me in my trials .
I confer on you a kingdom , even as my Father conferred on me ,
that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom . you will sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . "
the Lord said , " Simon , Simon , behold , Satan asked to have you , that he might sift you as wheat ,
but I prayed for you , that your faith wouldn 't fail . you , when once you have turned again , establish your brothers . "
he said to him , " Lord , I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death ! "
he said , " I tell you , Peter , the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times . "
then he said to them , " But now , whoever has a purse , let him take it , and likewise a wallet . whoever has none , let him sell his cloak , and buy a sword .
for I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me : ' he was counted with transgressors . ' for that which concerns me has an end . "
they said , " Lord , behold , here are two swords . " he said to them , " That is enough . "
he came out , and went , as his custom was , to the Mount of olives . his disciples also followed him .
when he was at the place , he said to them , " pray that you don 't enter into temptation . "
an angel from heaven appeared to him , strengthening him .
being in agony he prayed more earnestly . his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground .
when he rose up from his prayer , he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping because of grief ,
and said to them , " Why do you sleep ? rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation . "
when those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said to him , " Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? "
a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
but Jesus answered , " Let me at least do this " --and he touched his ear , and healed him .
Jesus said to the chief priests , captains of the temple , and elders , who had come against him , " Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs ?
when I was with you in the temple daily , you didn 't stretch out your hands against me . but this is your hour , and the power of darkness . "
they seized him , and led him away , and brought him into the high priest 's house . but Peter followed from a distance .
when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard , and had sat down together , Peter sat among them .
a certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light , and looking intently at him , said , " This man also was with him . "
he denied Jesus , saying , " Woman , I don 't know him . "
after a little while someone else saw him , and said , " You also are one of them ! " but Peter answered , " Man , I am not ! "
after about one hour passed , another confidently affirmed , saying , " Truly this man also was with him , for he is a Galilean ! "
but Peter said , " Man , I don 't know what you are talking about ! " immediately , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
the men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him .
having blindfolded him , they struck him on the face and asked him , " Prophesy ! who is the one who struck you ? "
they spoke many other things against him , insulting him .
as soon as it was day , the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together , both chief priests and scribes , and they led him away into their council , saying ,
" if you are the Christ , tell us . " but he said to them , " If I tell you , you won 't believe ,
and if I ask , you will in no way answer me or let me go .
from now on , the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God . "
they all said , " Are you then the Son of God ? " he said to them , " You say it , because I am . "
they said , " Why do we need any more witness ? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth ! "
the whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate .
they began to accuse him , saying , " We found this man perverting the nation , forbidding paying taxes to Caesar , and saying that he himself is Christ , a king . "
Pilate asked him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " he answered him , " So you say . "
Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes , " I find no basis for a charge against this man . "
but they insisted , saying , " He stirs up the people , teaching throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee even to this place . "
when he found out that he was in Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who was also in Jerusalem during those days .
now when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceedingly glad , for he had wanted to see him for a long time , because he had heard many things about him . he hoped to see some miracle done by him .
he questioned him with many words , but he gave no answers .
the chief priests and the scribes stood , vehemently accusing him .
Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him . dressing him in luxurious clothing , they sent him back to Pilate .
Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day , for before that they were enemies with each other .
neither has Herod , for I sent you to him , and see , nothing worthy of death has been done by him .
I will therefore chastise him and release him . "
but they all cried out together , saying , " away with this man ! release to us Barabbas ! " --
one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city , and for murder .
but they shouted , saying , " Crucify ! Crucify him ! "
he said to them the third time , " Why ? what evil has this man done ? I have found no capital crime in him . I will therefore chastise him and release him . "
but they were urgent with loud voices , asking that he might be crucified . their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed .
he released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder , for whom they asked , but he delivered Jesus up to their will .
when they led him away , they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene , coming from the country , and laid on him the cross , to carry it after Jesus .
a great multitude of the people followed him , including women who also mourned and lamented him .
but Jesus , turning to them , said , " Daughters of Jerusalem , don 't weep for me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
for behold , the days are coming in which they will say , ' blessed are the barren , the wombs that never bore , and the breasts that never nursed . '
then they will begin to tell the mountains , ' Fall on us ! ' and tell the hills , ' Cover us . '
for if they do these things in the green tree , what will be done in the dry ? "
there were also others , two criminals , led with him to be put to death .
when they came to the place that is called The skull , they crucified him there with the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
Jesus said , " Father , forgive them , for they don 't know what they are doing . " dividing his garments among them , they cast lots .
the people stood watching . the rulers with them also scoffed at him , saying , " He saved others . let him save himself , if this is the Christ of God , his chosen one ! "
the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him and offering him vinegar ,
an inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and Hebrew : " this IS the King of the Jews . "
one of the criminals who was hanged insulted him , saying , " If you are the Christ , save yourself and us ! "
but the other answered , and rebuking him said , " Don 't you even fear God , seeing you are under the same condemnation ?
and we indeed justly , for we receive the due reward for our deeds , but this man has done nothing wrong . "
he said to Jesus , " Lord , remember me when you come into your Kingdom . "
Jesus said to him , " Assuredly I tell you , today you will be with me in Paradise . "
it was now about the sixth hour , and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour .
Jesus , crying with a loud voice , said , " Father , into your hands I commit my spirit ! " having said this , he breathed his last .
when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , " Certainly this was a righteous man . "
all the multitudes that came together to see this , when they saw the things that were done , returned home beating their breasts .
all his acquaintances , and the women who followed with him from Galilee , stood at a distance , watching these things .
behold , a man named Joseph , who was a member of the council , a good and righteous man
( he had not consented to their counsel and deed ) , from Arimathaea , a city of the Jews , who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God :
this man went to Pilate , and asked for Jesus ' body .
he took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no one had ever been laid .
it was the day of the Preparation , and the Sabbath was drawing near .
the women , who had come with him out of Galilee , followed after , and saw the tomb , and how his body was laid .
they returned , and prepared spices and ointments . on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment .
but on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they and some others came to the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared .
they found the stone rolled away from the tomb .
they entered in , and didn 't find the Lord Jesus ' body .
it happened , while they were greatly perplexed about this , behold , two men stood by them in dazzling clothing .
becoming terrified , they bowed their faces down to the earth . they said to them , " Why do you seek the living among the dead ?
he isn 't here , but is risen . remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee ,
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again ? "
they remembered his words ,
returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
now they were Mary Magdalene , Joanna , and Mary the mother of James . the other women with them told these things to the Apostles .
these words seemed to them to be nonsense , and they didn 't believe them .
but Peter got up and ran to the tomb . Stooping and looking in , he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves , and he departed to his home , wondering what had happened .
behold , two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus , which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem .
they talked with each other about all of these things which had happened .
it happened , while they talked and questioned together , that Jesus himself came near , and went with them .
but their eyes were kept from recognizing him .
he said to them , " What are you talking about as you walk , and are sad ? "
one of them , named Cleopas , answered him , " Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn 't know the things which have happened there in these days ? "
some of us went to the tomb , and found it just like the women had said , but they didn 't see him . "
he said to them , " foolish men , and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken !
Didn 't the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory ? "
beginning from Moses and from all the prophets , he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself .
it happened , that when he had sat down at the table with them , he took the bread and gave thanks . breaking it , he gave to them .
their eyes were opened , and they recognized him , and he vanished out of their sight .
they said one to another , " Weren 't our hearts burning within us , while he spoke to us along the way , and while he opened the Scriptures to us ? "
they rose up that very hour , returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and those who were with them ,
saying , " The Lord is risen indeed , and has appeared to Simon ! "
they related the things that happened along the way , and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread .
as they said these things , Jesus himself stood among them , and said to them , " Peace be to you . "
but they were terrified and filled with fear , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
he said to them , " Why are you troubled ? why do doubts arise in your hearts ?
see my hands and my feet , that it is truly me . touch me and see , for a spirit doesn 't have flesh and bones , as you see that I have . "
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
while they still didn 't believe for joy , and wondered , he said to them , " Do you have anything here to eat ? "
they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb .
he took them , and ate in front of them .
then he opened their minds , that they might understand the Scriptures .
you are witnesses of these things .
behold , I send forth the promise of my Father on you . but wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high . "
he led them out as far as Bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
it happened , while he blessed them , that he withdrew from them , and was carried up into heaven .
they worshiped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
and were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen .
in the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
the same was in the beginning with God .
all things were made through him . without him was not anything made that has been made .
in him was life , and the life was the light of men .
the light shines in the darkness , and the darkness hasn 't overcome it .
there came a man , sent from God , whose name was John .
the same came as a witness , that he might testify about the light , that all might believe through him .
he was not the light , but was sent that he might testify about the light .
the true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world .
he was in the world , and the world was made through him , and the world didn 't recognize him .
he came to his own , and those who were his own didn 't receive him .
but as many as received him , to them he gave the right to become God 's children , to those who believe in his name :
who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
the Word became flesh , and lived among us . we saw his glory , such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father , full of grace and truth .
John testified about him . he cried out , saying , " This was he of whom I said , ' He who comes after me has surpassed me , for he was before me . ' "
from his fullness we all received grace upon grace .
for the law was given through Moses . grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ .
no one has seen God at any time . the one and only Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he has declared him .
they said therefore to him , " Who are you ? give us an answer to take back to those who sent us . what do you say about yourself ? "
he said , " I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , ' Make straight the way of the Lord , ' as Isaiah the prophet said . "
John answered them , " I baptize in water , but among you stands one whom you don 't know .
he is the one who comes after me , who is preferred before me , whose sandal strap I 'm not worthy to loosen . "
these things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
the next day , he saw Jesus coming to him , and said , " behold , the lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
this is he of whom I said , ' After me comes a man who is preferred before me , for he was before me . '
I didn 't know him , but for this reason I came baptizing in water : that he would be revealed to Israel . "
John testified , saying , " I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven , and it remained on him .
I didn 't recognize him , but he who sent me to baptize in water , he said to me , ' On whomever you will see the Spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit . '
I have seen , and have testified that this is the Son of God . "
again , the next day , John was standing with two of his disciples ,
and he looked at Jesus as he walked , and said , " behold , the lamb of God ! "
the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
Jesus turned , and saw them following , and said to them , " What are you looking for ? " they said to him , " Rabbi " ( which is to say , being interpreted , Teacher ) , " where are you staying ? "
he said to them , " Come , and see . " they came and saw where he was staying , and they stayed with him that day . it was about the tenth hour .
one of the two who heard John , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother .
he first found his own brother , Simon , and said to him , " We have found the Messiah ! " ( which is , being interpreted , Christ ) .
he brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him , and said , " You are Simon the son of Jonah . you shall be called Cephas " ( which is by interpretation , Peter ) .
on the next day , he was determined to go out into Galilee , and he found Philip . Jesus said to him , " Follow me . "
now Philip was from Bethsaida , of the city of Andrew and Peter .
Philip found Nathanael , and said to him , " We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , wrote : Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . "
Nathanael said to him , " Can any good thing come out of Nazareth ? " Philip said to him , " Come and see . "
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and said about him , " behold , an Israelite indeed , in whom is no deceit ! "
Nathanael said to him , " How do you know me ? " Jesus answered him , " Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . "
Nathanael answered him , " Rabbi , you are the Son of God ! you are King of Israel ! "
Jesus answered him , " Because I told you , ' I saw you underneath the fig tree , ' do you believe ? you will see greater things than these ! "
he said to him , " Most certainly , I tell you , hereafter you will see heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man . "
the third day , there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee . Jesus ' mother was there .
Jesus also was invited , with his disciples , to the marriage .
when the wine ran out , Jesus ' mother said to him , " They have no wine . "
now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews ' way of purifying , containing two or three metretes apiece .
Jesus said to them , " fill the water pots with water . " they filled them up to the brim .
he said to them , " Now draw some out , and take it to the ruler of the feast . " so they took it .
this beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee , and revealed his glory ; and his disciples believed in him .
after this , he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , his brothers , and his disciples ; and they stayed there a few days .
the Passover of the Jews was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
he made a whip of cords , and threw all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen ; and he poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew their tables .
to those who sold the doves , he said , " Take these things out of here ! Don 't make my Father 's house a marketplace ! "
his disciples remembered that it was written , " zeal for your house will eat me up . "
the Jews therefore answered him , " What sign do you show us , seeing that you do these things ? "
Jesus answered them , " Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . "
the Jews therefore said , " It took forty @-@ six years to build this temple ! will you raise it up in three days ? "
but he spoke of the temple of his body .
when therefore he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he said this , and they believed the Scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover , during the feast , many believed in his name , observing his signs which he did .
but Jesus didn 't trust himself to them , because he knew everyone ,
and because he didn 't need for anyone to testify concerning man ; for he himself knew what was in man .
Jesus answered him , " Most certainly , I tell you , unless one is born anew , he can 't see the Kingdom of God . "
Nicodemus said to him , " How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ? "
Jesus answered , " Most certainly I tell you , unless one is born of water and spirit , he can 't enter into the Kingdom of God !
that which is born of the flesh is flesh . that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
Don 't marvel that I said to you , ' You must be born anew . '
the wind blows where it wants to , and you hear its sound , but don 't know where it comes from and where it is going . so is everyone who is born of the Spirit . "
Nicodemus answered him , " How can these things be ? "
Jesus answered him , " Are you the teacher of Israel , and don 't understand these things ?
most certainly I tell you , we speak that which we know , and testify of that which we have seen , and you don 't receive our witness .
if I told you earthly things and you don 't believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
no one has ascended into heaven , but he who descended out of heaven , the Son of Man , who is in heaven .
as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
that whoever believes in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
for God so loved the world , that he gave his one and only Son , that whoever believes in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
for God didn 't send his Son into the world to judge the world , but that the world should be saved through him .
he who believes in him is not judged . he who doesn 't believe has been judged already , because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God .
this is the judgment , that the light has come into the world , and men loved the darkness rather than the light ; for their works were evil .
for everyone who does evil hates the light , and doesn 't come to the light , lest his works would be exposed .
but he who does the truth comes to the light , that his works may be revealed , that they have been done in God . "
after these things , Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea . he stayed there with them , and baptized .
John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim , because there was much water there . they came , and were baptized .
for John was not yet thrown into prison .
there arose therefore a questioning on the part of John 's disciples with some Jews about purification .
John answered , " A man can receive nothing , unless it has been given him from heaven .
you yourselves testify that I said , ' I am not the Christ , ' but , ' I have been sent before him . '
he who has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice . this , my joy , therefore is made full .
he must increase , but I must decrease .
he who comes from above is above all . he who is from the earth belongs to the earth , and speaks of the earth . he who comes from heaven is above all .
what he has seen and heard , of that he testifies ; and no one receives his witness .
he who has received his witness has set his seal to this , that God is true .
for he whom God has sent speaks the words of God ; for God gives the Spirit without measure .
the Father loves the Son , and has given all things into his hand .
one who believes in the Son has eternal life , but one who disobeys the Son won 't see life , but the wrath of God remains on him . "
he needed to pass through Samaria .
so he came to a city of Samaria , called Sychar , near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son , Joseph .
Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being tired from his journey , sat down by the well . it was about the sixth hour .
a woman of Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , " Give me a drink . "
for his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food .
the Samaritan woman therefore said to him , " How is it that you , being a Jew , ask for a drink from me , a Samaritan woman ? " ( for Jews have no dealings with Samaritans . )
the woman said to him , " Sir , you have nothing to draw with , and the well is deep . from where then have you that living water ?
are you greater than our father , Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank of it himself , as did his children , and his livestock ? "
Jesus answered her , " Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again ,
but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again ; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life . "
the woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water , so that I don 't get thirsty , neither come all the way here to draw . "
Jesus said to her , " Go , call your husband , and come here . "
the woman answered , " I have no husband . " Jesus said to her , " You said well , ' I have no husband , '
for you have had five husbands ; and he whom you now have is not your husband . this you have said truly . "
the woman said to him , " Sir , I perceive that you are a prophet .
our fathers worshiped in this mountain , and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship . "
Jesus said to her , " Woman , believe me , the hour comes , when neither in this mountain , nor in Jerusalem , will you worship the Father .
you worship that which you don 't know . we worship that which we know ; for salvation is from the Jews .
but the hour comes , and now is , when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers .
God is spirit , and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth . "
the woman said to him , " I know that Messiah comes , " ( he who is called Christ ) . " when he has come , he will declare to us all things . "
Jesus said to her , " I am he , the one who speaks to you . "
at this , his disciples came . they marveled that he was speaking with a woman ; yet no one said , " What are you looking for ? " or , " Why do you speak with her ? "
they went out of the city , and were coming to him .
in the meanwhile , the disciples urged him , saying , " Rabbi , eat . "
but he said to them , " I have food to eat that you don 't know about . "
the disciples therefore said one to another , " Has anyone brought him something to eat ? "
Jesus said to them , " My food is to do the will of him who sent me , and to accomplish his work .
he who reaps receives wages , and gathers fruit to eternal life ; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together .
for in this the saying is true , ' One sows , and another reaps . '
I sent you to reap that for which you haven 't labored . others have labored , and you have entered into their labor . "
from that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman , who testified , " He told me everything that I did . "
so when the Samaritans came to him , they begged him to stay with them . he stayed there two days .
many more believed because of his word .
they said to the woman , " Now we believe , not because of your speaking ; for we have heard for ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Savior of the world . "
after the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee .
for Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country .
so when he came into Galilee , the Galileans received him , having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast , for they also went to the feast .
Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee , where he made the water into wine . there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum .
when he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee , he went to him , and begged him that he would come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
Jesus therefore said to him , " Unless you see signs and wonders , you will in no way believe . "
the nobleman said to him , " Sir , come down before my child dies . "
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your son lives . " the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he went his way .
as he was now going down , his servants met him and reported , saying " Your child lives ! "
so he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better . they said therefore to him , " Yesterday at the seventh hour , the fever left him . "
so the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him , " Your son lives . " he believed , as did his whole house .
this is again the second sign that Jesus did , having come out of Judea into Galilee .
after these things , there was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate , there is a pool , which is called in Hebrew , " Bethesda , " having five porches .
in these lay a great multitude of those who were sick , blind , lame , or paralyzed , waiting for the moving of the water ;
a certain man was there , who had been sick for thirty @-@ eight years .
when Jesus saw him lying there , and knew that he had been sick for a long time , he asked him , " Do you want to be made well ? "
the sick man answered him , " Sir , I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up , but while I 'm coming , another steps down before me . "
Jesus said to him , " arise , take up your Mat , and walk . "
immediately , the man was made well , and took up his Mat and walked . now it was the Sabbath on that day .
so the Jews said to him who was cured , " It is the Sabbath . it is not lawful for you to carry the Mat . "
he answered them , " He who made me well , the same said to me , ' Take up your Mat , and walk . ' "
then they asked him , " Who is the man who said to you , ' Take up your Mat , and walk ' ? "
but he who was healed didn 't know who it was , for Jesus had withdrawn , a crowd being in the place .
afterward Jesus found him in the temple , and said to him , " behold , you are made well . sin no more , so that nothing worse happens to you . "
the man went away , and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus , and sought to kill him , because he did these things on the Sabbath .
but Jesus answered them , " My Father is still working , so I am working , too . "
for this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him , because he not only broke the Sabbath , but also called God his own Father , making himself equal with God .
Jesus therefore answered them , " Most certainly , I tell you , the Son can do nothing of himself , but what he sees the Father doing . for whatever things he does , these the Son also does likewise .
for the Father has affection for the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does . he will show him greater works than these , that you may marvel .
for as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires .
for the Father judges no one , but he has given all judgment to the Son ,
that all may honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . he who doesn 't honor the Son doesn 't honor the Father who sent him .
" most certainly I tell you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has eternal life , and doesn 't come into judgment , but has passed out of death into life .
most certainly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God 's voice ; and those who hear will live .
for as the Father has life in himself , even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself .
he also gave him authority to execute judgment , because he is a son of man .
Don 't marvel at this , for the hour comes , in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice ,
and will come out ; those who have done good , to the resurrection of life ; and those who have done evil , to the resurrection of judgment .
I can of myself do nothing . as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righteous ; because I don 't seek my own will , but the will of my Father who sent me .
" if I testify about myself , my witness is not valid .
it is another who testifies about me . I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true .
you have sent to John , and he has testified to the truth .
but the testimony which I receive is not from man . however , I say these things that you may be saved .
he was the burning and shining lamp , and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light .
but the testimony which I have is greater than that of John , for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish , the very works that I do , testify about me , that the Father has sent me .
the Father himself , who sent me , has testified about me . you have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his form .
you don 't have his word living in you ; because you don 't believe him whom he sent .
" you search the Scriptures , because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and these are they which testify about me .
yet you will not come to me , that you may have life .
but I know you , that you don 't have God 's love in yourselves .
I have come in my Father 's name , and you don 't receive me . if another comes in his own name , you will receive him .
how can you believe , who receive glory from one another , and you don 't seek the glory that comes from the only God ?
" Don 't think that I will accuse you to the Father . there is one who accuses you , even Moses , on whom you have set your hope .
for if you believed Moses , you would believe me ; for he wrote about me .
but if you don 't believe his writings , how will you believe my words ? "
after these things , Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee , which is also called the Sea of Tiberias .
a great multitude followed him , because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick .
Jesus went up into the mountain , and he sat there with his disciples .
now the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was at hand .
Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes , and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him , said to Philip , " Where are we to buy bread , that these may eat ? "
this he said to test him , for he himself knew what he would do .
Philip answered him , " Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them , that everyone of them may receive a little . "
Jesus said , " Have the people sit down . " now there was much grass in that place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
Jesus took the loaves ; and having given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to those who were sitting down ; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired .
when they were filled , he said to his disciples , " Gather up the broken pieces which are left over , that nothing be lost . "
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which were left over by those who had eaten .
when therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did , they said , " This is truly the prophet who comes into the world . "
Jesus therefore , perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
when evening came , his disciples went down to the sea ,
and they entered into the boat , and were going over the sea to Capernaum . it was now dark , and Jesus had not come to them .
the sea was tossed by a great wind blowing .
when therefore they had rowed about twenty @-@ five or thirty stadia , they saw Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
but he said to them , " It is I . Don 't be afraid . "
they were willing therefore to receive him into the boat . immediately the boat was at the land where they were going .
on the next day , the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , except the one in which his disciples had embarked , and that Jesus hadn 't entered with his disciples into the boat , but his disciples had gone away alone .
however boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn 't there , nor his disciples , they themselves got into the boats , and came to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
when they found him on the other side of the sea , they asked him , " Rabbi , when did you come here ? "
Jesus answered them , " Most certainly I tell you , you seek me , not because you saw signs , but because you ate of the loaves , and were filled .
Don 't work for the food which perishes , but for the food which remains to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give to you . for God the Father has sealed him . "
they said therefore to him , " What must we do , that we may work the works of God ? "
Jesus answered them , " This is the work of God , that you believe in him whom he has sent . "
they said therefore to him , " What then do you do for a sign , that we may see , and believe you ? what work do you do ?
our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness . as it is written , ' He gave them bread out of heaven to eat . ' "
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly , I tell you , it wasn 't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven , but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven .
for the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven , and gives life to the world . "
Jesus said to them , " I am the bread of life . he who comes to me will not be hungry , and he who believes in me will never be thirsty .
but I told you that you have seen me , and yet you don 't believe .
all those whom the Father gives me will come to me . he who comes to me I will in no way throw out .
for I have come down from heaven , not to do my own will , but the will of him who sent me .
this is the will of my Father who sent me , that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing , but should raise him up at the last day .
this is the will of the one who sent me , that everyone who sees the Son , and believes in him , should have eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . "
the Jews therefore murmured concerning him , because he said , " I am the bread which came down out of heaven . "
they said , " Isn 't this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how then does he say , ' I have come down out of heaven ? ' "
therefore Jesus answered them , " Don 't murmur among yourselves .
no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him , and I will raise him up in the last day .
it is written in the prophets , ' They will all be taught by God . ' therefore everyone who hears from the Father , and has learned , comes to me .
not that anyone has seen the Father , except he who is from God . he has seen the Father .
most certainly , I tell you , he who believes in me has eternal life .
I am the bread of life .
your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
this is the bread which comes down out of heaven , that anyone may eat of it and not die .
I am the living bread which came down out of heaven . if anyone eats of this bread , he will live forever . yes , the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh . "
the Jews therefore contended with one another , saying , " How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? "
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you don 't have life in yourselves .
he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up at the last day .
for my flesh is food indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me , and I in him .
as the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father ; so he who feeds on me , he will also live because of me .
this is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our fathers ate the manna , and died . he who eats this bread will live forever . "
he said these things in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
therefore many of his disciples , when they heard this , said , " This is a hard saying ! who can listen to it ? "
but Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this , said to them , " Does this cause you to stumble ?
then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before ?
it is the spirit who gives life . the flesh profits nothing . the words that I speak to you are spirit , and are life .
but there are some of you who don 't believe . " for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn 't believe , and who it was who would betray him .
he said , " For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me , unless it is given to him by my Father . "
at this , many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
Jesus said therefore to the twelve , " You don 't also want to go away , do you ? "
Simon Peter answered him , " Lord , to whom would we go ? you have the words of eternal life .
we have come to believe and know that you are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
Jesus answered them , " Didn 't I choose you , the twelve , and one of you is a devil ? "
now he spoke of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , for it was he who would betray him , being one of the twelve .
after these things , Jesus was walking in Galilee , for he wouldn 't walk in Judea , because the Jews sought to kill him .
now the feast of the Jews , the Feast of booths , was at hand .
his brothers therefore said to him , " depart from here , and go into Judea , that your disciples also may see your works which you do .
for no one does anything in secret , and himself seeks to be known openly . if you do these things , reveal yourself to the world . "
for even his brothers didn 't believe in him .
Jesus therefore said to them , " My time has not yet come , but your time is always ready .
the world can 't hate you , but it hates me , because I testify about it , that its works are evil .
you go up to the feast . I am not yet going up to this feast , because my time is not yet fulfilled . "
having said these things to them , he stayed in Galilee .
but when his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
the Jews therefore sought him at the feast , and said , " Where is he ? "
there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him . some said , " He is a good man . " others said , " Not so , but he leads the multitude astray . "
yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews .
but when it was now the midst of the feast , Jesus went up into the temple and taught .
the Jews therefore marveled , saying , " How does this man know letters , having never been educated ? "
Jesus therefore answered them , " My teaching is not mine , but his who sent me .
if anyone desires to do his will , he will know about the teaching , whether it is from God , or if I am speaking from myself .
he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory , but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
Didn 't Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keeps the law ? why do you seek to kill me ? "
the multitude answered , " You have a demon ! who seeks to kill you ? "
Jesus answered them , " I did one work , and you all marvel because of it .
Moses has given you circumcision ( not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers ) , and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy .
if a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be broken , are you angry with me , because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath ?
Don 't judge according to appearance , but judge righteous judgment . "
therefore some of them of Jerusalem said , " Isn 't this he whom they seek to kill ?
behold , he speaks openly , and they say nothing to him . can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ ?
however we know where this man comes from , but when the Christ comes , no one will know where he comes from . "
I know him , because I am from him , and he sent me . "
they sought therefore to take him ; but no one laid a hand on him , because his hour had not yet come .
but of the multitude , many believed in him . they said , " When the Christ comes , he won 't do more signs than those which this man has done , will he ? "
the Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him , and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him .
then Jesus said , " I will be with you a little while longer , then I go to him who sent me .
you will seek me , and won 't find me ; and where I am , you can 't come . "
the Jews therefore said among themselves , " Where will this man go that we won 't find him ? will he go to the dispersion among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
what is this word that he said , ' You will seek me , and won 't find me ; and where I am , you can 't come ' ? "
now on the last and greatest day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , " If anyone is thirsty , let him come to me and drink !
he who believes in me , as the Scripture has said , from within him will flow rivers of living water . "
but he said this about the Spirit , which those believing in him were to receive . for the Holy Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus wasn 't yet glorified .
many of the multitude therefore , when they heard these words , said , " This is truly the prophet . "
others said , " This is the Christ . " but some said , " What , does the Christ come out of Galilee ?
Hasn 't the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David , and from Bethlehem , the village where David was ? "
so there arose a division in the multitude because of him .
some of them would have arrested him , but no one laid hands on him .
the officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , " Why didn 't you bring him ? "
the officers answered , " No man ever spoke like this man ! "
the Pharisees therefore answered them , " You aren 't also led astray , are you ?
have any of the rulers believed in him , or of the Pharisees ?
but this multitude that doesn 't know the law is accursed . "
they answered him , " Are you also from Galilee ? search , and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee . "
everyone went to his own house ,
but Jesus went to the Mount of olives .
now very early in the morning , he came again into the temple , and all the people came to him . he sat down , and taught them .
now in our law , Moses commanded us to stone such . what then do you say about her ? "
they said this testing him , that they might have something to accuse him of . but Jesus stooped down , and wrote on the ground with his finger .
but when they continued asking him , he looked up and said to them , " He who is without sin among you , let him throw the first stone at her . "
again he stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground .
they , when they heard it , being convicted by their conscience , went out one by one , beginning from the oldest , even to the last . Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was , in the middle .
Jesus , standing up , saw her and said , " Woman , where are your accusers ? did no one condemn you ? "
she said , " No one , Lord . " Jesus said , " Neither do I condemn you . go your way . from now on , sin no more . "
again , therefore , Jesus spoke to them , saying , " I am the light of the world . he who follows me will not walk in the darkness , but will have the light of life . "
the Pharisees therefore said to him , " You testify about yourself . your testimony is not valid . "
you judge according to the flesh . I judge no one .
even if I do judge , my judgment is true , for I am not alone , but I am with the Father who sent me .
it 's also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid .
I am one who testifies about myself , and the Father who sent me testifies about me . "
they said therefore to him , " Where is your Father ? " Jesus answered , " You know neither me , nor my Father . if you knew me , you would know my Father also . "
Jesus spoke these words in the treasury , as he taught in the temple . yet no one arrested him , because his hour had not yet come .
Jesus said therefore again to them , " I am going away , and you will seek me , and you will die in your sins . where I go , you can 't come . "
the Jews therefore said , " Will he kill himself , that he says , ' Where I am going , you can 't come ? ' "
he said to them , " You are from beneath . I am from above . you are of this world . I am not of this world .
I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins ; for unless you believe that I am he , you will die in your sins . "
they said therefore to him , " Who are you ? " Jesus said to them , " Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning .
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . however he who sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these I say to the world . "
they didn 't understand that he spoke to them about the Father .
Jesus therefore said to them , " When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he , and I do nothing of myself , but as my Father taught me , I say these things .
he who sent me is with me . the Father hasn 't left me alone , for I always do the things that are pleasing to him . "
as he spoke these things , many believed in him .
they answered him , " We are Abraham 's seed , and have never been in bondage to anyone . how do you say , ' You will be made free ? ' "
Jesus answered them , " Most certainly I tell you , everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin .
a bondservant doesn 't live in the house forever . a son remains forever .
if therefore the Son makes you free , you will be free indeed .
I know that you are Abraham 's seed , yet you seek to kill me , because my word finds no place in you .
I say the things which I have seen with my Father ; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father . "
they answered him , " Our father is Abraham . " Jesus said to them , " If you were Abraham 's children , you would do the works of Abraham .
but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . Abraham didn 't do this .
you do the works of your father . " they said to him , " We were not born of sexual immorality . we have one Father , God . "
therefore Jesus said to them , " If God were your father , you would love me , for I came out and have come from God . for I haven 't come of myself , but he sent me .
why don 't you understand my speech ? because you can 't hear my word .
but because I tell the truth , you don 't believe me .
which of you convicts me of sin ? if I tell the truth , why do you not believe me ?
he who is of God hears the words of God . for this cause you don 't hear , because you are not of God . "
then the Jews answered him , " Don 't we say well that you are a Samaritan , and have a demon ? "
Jesus answered , " I don 't have a demon , but I honor my Father , and you dishonor me .
but I don 't seek my own glory . there is one who seeks and judges .
most certainly , I tell you , if a person keeps my word , he will never see death . "
then the Jews said to him , " Now we know that you have a demon . Abraham died , and the prophets ; and you say , ' If a man keeps my word , he will never taste of death . '
are you greater than our father , Abraham , who died ? the prophets died . who do you make yourself out to be ? "
Jesus answered , " If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . it is my Father who glorifies me , of whom you say that he is our God .
you have not known him , but I know him . if I said , ' I don 't know him , ' I would be like you , a liar . but I know him , and keep his word .
your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day . he saw it , and was glad . "
the Jews therefore said to him , " You are not yet fifty years old , and have you seen Abraham ? "
Jesus said to them , " Most certainly , I tell you , before Abraham came into existence , I AM . "
therefore they took up stones to throw at him , but Jesus was hidden , and went out of the temple , having gone through their midst , and so passed by .
as he passed by , he saw a man blind from birth .
his disciples asked him , " Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? "
Jesus answered , " Neither did this man sin , nor his parents ; but , that the works of God might be revealed in him .
I must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day . the night is coming , when no one can work .
while I am in the world , I am the light of the world . "
when he had said this , he spat on the ground , made mud with the saliva , anointed the blind man 's eyes with the mud ,
and said to him , " Go , wash in the pool of Siloam " ( which means " sent " ) . so he went away , washed , and came back seeing .
the neighbors therefore , and those who saw that he was blind before , said , " Isn 't this he who sat and begged ? "
they therefore were asking him , " How were your eyes opened ? "
they brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees .
it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes .
again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight . he said to them , " He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and I see . "
therefore they asked the blind man again , " What do you say about him , because he opened your eyes ? " he said , " He is a prophet . "
the Jews therefore did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of him who had received his sight ,
and asked them , " Is this your son , whom you say was born blind ? how then does he now see ? "
his parents answered them , " We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
but how he now sees , we don 't know ; or who opened his eyes , we don 't know . he is of age . ask him . he will speak for himself . "
his parents said these things because they feared the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ , he would be put out of the synagogue .
therefore his parents said , " He is of age . ask him . "
so they called the man who was blind a second time , and said to him , " Give glory to God . we know that this man is a sinner . "
he therefore answered , " I don 't know if he is a sinner . one thing I do know : that though I was blind , now I see . "
they said to him again , " What did he do to you ? how did he open your eyes ? "
he answered them , " I told you already , and you didn 't listen . why do you want to hear it again ? you don 't also want to become his disciples , do you ? "
they insulted him and said , " You are his disciple , but we are disciples of Moses .
we know that God has spoken to Moses . but as for this man , we don 't know where he comes from . "
the man answered them , " How amazing ! you don 't know where he comes from , yet he opened my eyes .
we know that God doesn 't listen to sinners , but if anyone is a worshipper of God , and does his will , he listens to him .
since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind .
if this man were not from God , he could do nothing . "
they answered him , " You were altogether born in sins , and do you teach us ? " they threw him out .
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , and finding him , he said , " Do you believe in the Son of God ? "
he answered , " Who is he , Lord , that I may believe in him ? "
Jesus said to him , " You have both seen him , and it is he who speaks with you . "
he said , " Lord , I believe ! " and he worshiped him .
Jesus said , " I came into this world for judgment , that those who don 't see may see ; and that those who see may become blind . "
those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things , and said to him , " Are we also blind ? "
Jesus said to them , " If you were blind , you would have no sin ; but now you say , ' We see . ' therefore your sin remains .
" most certainly , I tell you , one who doesn 't enter by the door into the sheep fold , but climbs up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
but one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
the gatekeeper opens the gate for him , and the sheep listen to his voice . he calls his own sheep by name , and leads them out .
whenever he brings out his own sheep , he goes before them , and the sheep follow him , for they know his voice .
they will by no means follow a stranger , but will flee from him ; for they don 't know the voice of strangers . "
Jesus spoke this parable to them , but they didn 't understand what he was telling them .
Jesus therefore said to them again , " Most certainly , I tell you , I am the sheep 's door .
all who came before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep didn 't listen to them .
I am the door . if anyone enters in by me , he will be saved , and will go in and go out , and will find pasture .
the thief only comes to steal , kill , and destroy . I came that they may have life , and may have it abundantly .
I am the good shepherd . the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
he who is a hired hand , and not a shepherd , who doesn 't own the sheep , sees the wolf coming , leaves the sheep , and flees . the wolf snatches the sheep , and scatters them .
the hired hand flees because he is a hired hand , and doesn 't care for the sheep .
I am the good shepherd . I know my own , and I 'm known by my own ;
I have other sheep , which are not of this fold . I must bring them also , and they will hear my voice . they will become one flock with one shepherd .
therefore the Father loves me , because I lay down my life , that I may take it again .
no one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words .
many of them said , " He has a demon , and is insane ! why do you listen to him ? "
others said , " These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon . it isn 't possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind , is it ? "
it was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem .
it was winter , and Jesus was walking in the temple , in Solomon 's porch .
the Jews therefore came around him and said to him , " How long will you hold us in suspense ? if you are the Christ , tell us plainly . "
Jesus answered them , " I told you , and you don 't believe . the works that I do in my Father 's name , these testify about me .
but you don 't believe , because you are not of my sheep , as I told you .
my sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me .
I give eternal life to them . they will never perish , and no one will snatch them out of my hand .
my Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all . no one is able to snatch them out of my Father 's hand .
therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him .
Jesus answered them , " I have shown you many good works from my Father . for which of those works do you stone me ? "
the Jews answered him , " We don 't stone you for a good work , but for blasphemy : because you , being a man , make yourself God . "
Jesus answered them , " Isn 't it written in your law , ' I said , you are gods ? '
if he called them gods , to whom the word of God came ( and the Scripture can 't be broken ) ,
do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ' You blaspheme , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ? '
if I don 't do the works of my Father , don 't believe me .
but if I do them , though you don 't believe me , believe the works ; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me , and I in the Father . "
they sought again to seize him , and he went out of their hand .
he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first , and there he stayed .
many came to him . they said , " John indeed did no sign , but everything that John said about this man is true . "
many believed in him there .
now a certain man was sick , Lazarus from Bethany , of the village of Mary and her sister , Martha .
it was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother , Lazarus , was sick .
the sisters therefore sent to him , saying , " Lord , behold , he for whom you have great affection is sick . "
but when Jesus heard it , he said , " This sickness is not to death , but for the glory of God , that God 's Son may be glorified by it . "
now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
when therefore he heard that he was sick , he stayed two days in the place where he was .
the disciples told him , " Rabbi , the Jews were just trying to stone you , and are you going there again ? "
Jesus answered , " Aren 't there twelve hours of daylight ? if a man walks in the day , he doesn 't stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
but if a man walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light isn 't in him . "
he said these things , and after that , he said to them , " Our friend , Lazarus , has fallen asleep , but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep . "
now Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep .
so Jesus said to them plainly then , " Lazarus is dead .
I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , so that you may believe . nevertheless , let 's go to him . "
Thomas therefore , who is called Didymus , said to his fellow disciples , " Let 's go also , that we may die with him . "
so when Jesus came , he found that he had been in the tomb four days already .
now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about fifteen stadia away .
many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary , to console them concerning their brother .
then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went and met him , but Mary stayed in the house .
therefore Martha said to Jesus , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wouldn 't have died .
even now I know that , whatever you ask of God , God will give you . "
Jesus said to her , " Your brother will rise again . "
Martha said to him , " I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day . "
Jesus said to her , " I am the resurrection and the life . he who believes in me will still live , even if he dies .
whoever lives and believes in me will never die . do you believe this ? "
she said to him , " Yes , Lord . I have come to believe that you are the Christ , God 's Son , he who comes into the world . "
when she had said this , she went away , and called Mary , her sister , secretly , saying , " The Teacher is here , and is calling you . "
when she heard this , she arose quickly , and went to him .
now Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was in the place where Martha met him .
therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wouldn 't have died . "
when Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
Jesus wept .
the Jews therefore said , " See how much affection he had for him ! "
some of them said , " Couldn 't this man , who opened the eyes of him who was blind , have also kept this man from dying ? "
Jesus therefore , again groaning in himself , came to the tomb . now it was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
Jesus said , " Take away the stone . " Martha , the sister of him who was dead , said to him , " Lord , by this time there is a stench , for he has been dead four days . "
Jesus said to her , " Didn 't I tell you that if you believed , you would see God 's glory ? "
so they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying . Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , " Father , I thank you that you listened to me .
I know that you always listen to me , but because of the multitude that stands around I said this , that they may believe that you sent me . "
when he had said this , he cried with a loud voice , " Lazarus , come out ! "
he who was dead came out , bound hand and foot with wrappings , and his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus said to them , " Free him , and let him go . "
therefore many of the Jews , who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did , believed in him .
but some of them went away to the Pharisees , and told them the things which Jesus had done .
the chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council , and said , " What are we doing ? for this man does many signs .
if we leave him alone like this , everyone will believe in him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . "
but a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being high priest that year , said to them , " You know nothing at all ,
nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation not perish . "
so from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death .
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews , but departed from there into the country near the wilderness , to a city called Ephraim . he stayed there with his disciples .
now the Passover of the Jews was at hand . many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover , to purify themselves .
then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another , as they stood in the temple , " What do you think--that he isn 't coming to the feast at all ? "
now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was , he should report it , that they might seize him .
then six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
so they made him a Supper there . Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him .
Mary , therefore , took a pound of ointment of pure Nard , very precious , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair . the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment .
now he said this , not because he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and having the money box , used to steal what was put into it .
but Jesus said , " Leave her alone . she has kept this for the day of my burial .
for you always have the poor with you , but you don 't always have me . "
a large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there , and they came , not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
but the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also ,
because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus .
on the next day a great multitude had come to the feast . when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
they took the branches of the palm trees , and went out to meet him , and cried out , " Hosanna ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord , the King of Israel ! "
his disciples didn 't understand these things at first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written about him , and that they had done these things to him .
the multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , was testifying about it .
for this cause also the multitude went and met him , because they heard that he had done this sign .
the Pharisees therefore said among themselves , " See how you accomplish nothing . behold , the world has gone after him . "
now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast .
these , therefore , came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida of Galilee , and asked him , saying , " Sir , we want to see Jesus . "
Jesus answered them , " The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
most certainly I tell you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains by itself alone . but if it dies , it bears much fruit .
he who loves his life will lose it . he who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life .
if anyone serves me , let him follow me . where I am , there will my servant also be . if anyone serves me , the Father will honor him .
" now my soul is troubled . what shall I say ? ' father , save me from this time ? ' but for this cause I came to this time .
father , glorify your name ! " then there came a voice out of the sky , saying , " I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again . "
the multitude therefore , who stood by and heard it , said that it had thundered . others said , " An angel has spoken to him . "
Jesus answered , " This voice hasn 't come for my sake , but for your sakes .
now is the judgment of this world . now the prince of this world will be cast out .
and I , if I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all people to myself . "
but he said this , signifying by what kind of death he should die .
the multitude answered him , " We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever . how do you say , ' The Son of Man must be lifted up ? ' who is this Son of Man ? "
Jesus therefore said to them , " Yet a little while the light is with you . walk while you have the light , that darkness doesn 't overtake you . he who walks in the darkness doesn 't know where he is going .
while you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become children of light . " Jesus said these things , and he departed and hid himself from them .
but though he had done so many signs before them , yet they didn 't believe in him ,
that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spoke , " Lord , who has believed our report ? to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? "
Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory , and spoke of him .
nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him , but because of the Pharisees they didn 't confess it , so that they wouldn 't be put out of the synagogue ,
for they loved men 's praise more than God 's praise .
Jesus cried out and said , " Whoever believes in me , believes not in me , but in him who sent me .
he who sees me sees him who sent me .
I have come as a light into the world , that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness .
if anyone listens to my sayings , and doesn 't believe , I don 't judge him . for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he who rejects me , and doesn 't receive my sayings , has one who judges him . the word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
for I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
I know that his commandment is eternal life . the things therefore which I speak , even as the Father has said to me , so I speak . "
now before the feast of the Passover , Jesus , knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end .
during Supper , the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ,
Jesus , knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he came forth from God , and was going to God ,
arose from Supper , and laid aside his outer garments . he took a towel , and wrapped a towel around his waist .
then he poured water into the basin , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
then he came to Simon Peter . he said to him , " Lord , do you wash my feet ? "
Jesus answered him , " You don 't know what I am doing now , but you will understand later . "
Peter said to him , " You will never wash my feet ! " Jesus answered him , " If I don 't wash you , you have no part with me . "
Simon Peter said to him , " Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head ! "
Jesus said to him , " Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed , but is completely clean . you are clean , but not all of you . "
for he knew him who would betray him , therefore he said , " You are not all clean . "
so when he had washed their feet , put his outer garment back on , and sat down again , he said to them , " Do you know what I have done to you ?
you call me , ' Teacher ' and ' Lord . ' you say so correctly , for so I am .
if I then , the Lord and the Teacher , have washed your feet , you also ought to wash one another 's feet .
for I have given you an example , that you also should do as I have done to you .
most certainly I tell you , a servant is not greater than his lord , neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him .
if you know these things , blessed are you if you do them .
I don 't speak concerning all of you . I know whom I have chosen . but that the Scripture may be fulfilled , ' He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me . '
from now on , I tell you before it happens , that when it happens , you may believe that I am he .
most certainly I tell you , he who receives whomever I send , receives me ; and he who receives me , receives him who sent me . "
when Jesus had said this , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , " Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me . "
the disciples looked at one another , perplexed about whom he spoke .
one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved , was at the table , leaning against Jesus ' breast .
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , and said to him , " Tell us who it is of whom he speaks . "
he , leaning back , as he was , on Jesus ' breast , asked him , " Lord , who is it ? "
Jesus therefore answered , " It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it . " so when he had dipped the piece of bread , he gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
after the piece of bread , then Satan entered into him . then Jesus said to him , " What you do , do quickly . "
now no man at the table knew why he said this to him .
therefore having received that morsel , he went out immediately . it was night .
when he had gone out , Jesus said , " Now the Son of Man has been glorified , and God has been glorified in him .
if God has been glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself , and he will glorify him immediately .
little children , I will be with you a little while longer . you will seek me , and as I said to the Jews , ' Where I am going , you can 't come , ' so now I tell you .
a new commandment I give to you , that you love one another , just like I have loved you ; that you also love one another .
by this everyone will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another . "
Simon Peter said to him , " Lord , where are you going ? " Jesus answered , " Where I am going , you can 't follow now , but you will follow afterwards . "
Peter said to him , " Lord , why can 't I follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you . "
Jesus answered him , " Will you lay down your life for me ? most certainly I tell you , the rooster won 't crow until you have denied me three times .
" Don 't let your heart be troubled . believe in God . believe also in me .
in my Father 's house are many homes . if it weren 't so , I would have told you . I am going to prepare a place for you .
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
where I go , you know , and you know the way . "
Thomas said to him , " Lord , we don 't know where you are going . how can we know the way ? "
Jesus said to him , " I am the way , the truth , and the life . no one comes to the Father , except through me .
if you had known me , you would have known my Father also . from now on , you know him , and have seen him . "
Philip said to him , " Lord , show us the Father , and that will be enough for us . "
Don 't you believe that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I tell you , I speak not from myself ; but the Father who lives in me does his works .
believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ; or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my Father .
whatever you will ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
if you will ask anything in my name , I will do it .
if you love me , keep my commandments .
I will not leave you orphans . I will come to you .
yet a little while , and the world will see me no more ; but you will see me . because I live , you will live also .
in that day you will know that I am in my Father , and you in me , and I in you .
one who has my commandments , and keeps them , that person is one who loves me . one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to him , " Lord , what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us , and not to the world ? "
Jesus answered him , " If a man loves me , he will keep my word . my Father will love him , and we will come to him , and make our home with him .
he who doesn 't love me doesn 't keep my words . the word which you hear isn 't mine , but the Father 's who sent me .
I have said these things to you , while still living with you .
but the counselor , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and will remind you of all that I said to you .
peace I leave with you . my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . Don 't let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fearful .
you heard how I told you , ' I go away , and I come to you . ' if you loved me , you would have rejoiced , because I said ' I am going to my Father ; ' for the Father is greater than I.
now I have told you before it happens so that , when it happens , you may believe .
I will no more speak much with you , for the prince of the world comes , and he has nothing in me .
but that the world may know that I love the Father , and as the Father commanded me , even so I do . arise , let us go from here .
" I am the true vine , and my Father is the farmer .
every branch in me that doesn 't bear fruit , he takes away . every branch that bears fruit , he prunes , that it may bear more fruit .
you are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you .
remain in me , and I in you . as the branch can 't bear fruit by itself , unless it remains in the vine , so neither can you , unless you remain in me .
I am the vine . you are the branches . he who remains in me , and I in him , the same bears much fruit , for apart from me you can do nothing .
if a man doesn 't remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is withered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
if you remain in me , and my words remain in you , you will ask whatever you desire , and it will be done for you .
" in this is my Father glorified , that you bear much fruit ; and so you will be my disciples .
even as the Father has loved me , I also have loved you . remain in my love .
if you keep my commandments , you will remain in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and remain in his love .
I have spoken these things to you , that my joy may remain in you , and that your joy may be made full .
" this is my commandment , that you love one another , even as I have loved you .
greater love has no one than this , that someone lay down his life for his friends .
you are my friends , if you do whatever I command you .
no longer do I call you servants , for the servant doesn 't know what his lord does . but I have called you friends , for everything that I heard from my Father , I have made known to you .
" I command these things to you , that you may love one another .
if the world hates you , you know that it has hated me before it hated you .
if you were of the world , the world would love its own . but because you are not of the world , since I chose you out of the world , therefore the world hates you .
remember the word that I said to you : ' a servant is not greater than his lord . ' if they persecuted me , they will also persecute you . if they kept my word , they will keep yours also .
but all these things will they do to you for my name 's sake , because they don 't know him who sent me .
if I had not come and spoken to them , they would not have had sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
if I hadn 't done among them the works which no one else did , they wouldn 't have had sin . but now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father .
but this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law , ' They hated me without a cause . '
" when the counselor has come , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will testify about me .
you will also testify , because you have been with me from the beginning .
" these things have I spoken to you , so that you wouldn 't be caused to stumble .
they will put you out of the synagogues . yes , the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God .
they will do these things because they have not known the Father , nor me .
but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I didn 't tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
but now I am going to him who sent me , and none of you asks me , ' Where are you going ? '
but because I have told you these things , sorrow has filled your heart .
nevertheless I tell you the truth : it is to your advantage that I go away , for if I don 't go away , the counselor won 't come to you . but if I go , I will send him to you .
when he has come , he will convict the world about sin , about righteousness , and about judgment ;
about sin , because they don 't believe in me ;
about righteousness , because I am going to my Father , and you won 't see me any more ;
about judgment , because the prince of this world has been judged .
" I have yet many things to tell you , but you can 't bear them now .
however when he , the Spirit of truth , has come , he will guide you into all truth , for he will not speak from himself ; but whatever he hears , he will speak . he will declare to you things that are coming .
he will glorify me , for he will take from what is mine , and will declare it to you .
all things whatever the Father has are mine ; therefore I said that he takes of mine , and will declare it to you .
a little while , and you will not see me . again a little while , and you will see me . "
they said therefore , " What is this that he says , ' A little while ? ' we don 't know what he is saying . "
therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him , and he said to them , " Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this , that I said , ' A little while , and you won 't see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ? '
most certainly I tell you , that you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . you will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
a woman , when she gives birth , has sorrow , because her time has come . but when she has delivered the child , she doesn 't remember the anguish any more , for the joy that a human being is born into the world .
therefore you now have sorrow , but I will see you again , and your heart will rejoice , and no one will take your joy away from you .
" in that day you will ask me no questions . most certainly I tell you , whatever you may ask of the Father in my name , he will give it to you .
until now , you have asked nothing in my name . ask , and you will receive , that your joy may be made full .
I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech . but the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech , but will tell you plainly about the Father .
in that day you will ask in my name ; and I don 't say to you , that I will pray to the Father for you ,
for the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me , and have believed that I came forth from God .
I came out from the Father , and have come into the world . again , I leave the world , and go to the Father . "
his disciples said to him , " behold , now you speak plainly , and speak no figures of speech .
now we know that you know all things , and don 't need for anyone to question you . by this we believe that you came forth from God . "
Jesus answered them , " Do you now believe ?
behold , the time is coming , yes , and has now come , that you will be scattered , everyone to his own place , and you will leave me alone . yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
I have told you these things , that in me you may have peace . in the world you have oppression ; but cheer up ! I have overcome the world . "
Jesus said these things , and lifting up his eyes to heaven , he said , " Father , the time has come . Glorify your Son , that your Son may also glorify you ;
even as you gave him authority over all flesh , he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him .
this is eternal life , that they should know you , the only true God , and him whom you sent , Jesus Christ .
I glorified you on the earth . I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do .
now , Father , glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed .
I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world . they were yours , and you have given them to me . they have kept your word .
now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you ,
for the words which you have given me I have given to them , and they received them , and knew for sure that I came forth from you , and they have believed that you sent me .
I pray for them . I don 't pray for the world , but for those whom you have given me , for they are yours .
all things that are mine are yours , and yours are mine , and I am glorified in them .
I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them through your name which you have given me , that they may be one , even as we are .
but now I come to you , and I say these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
I have given them your word . the world hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
I pray not that you would take them from the world , but that you would keep them from the evil one .
they are not of the world even as I am not of the world .
Sanctify them in your truth . your word is truth .
as you sent me into the world , even so I have sent them into the world .
for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth .
the glory which you have given me , I have given to them ; that they may be one , even as we are one ;
I in them , and you in me , that they may be perfected into one ; that the world may know that you sent me , and loved them , even as you loved me .
father , I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am , that they may see my glory , which you have given me , for you loved me before the foundation of the world .
Righteous Father , the world hasn 't known you , but I knew you ; and these knew that you sent me .
I made known to them your name , and will make it known ; that the love with which you loved me may be in them , and I in them . "
when Jesus had spoken these words , he went out with his disciples over the Brook Kidron , where there was a garden , into which he and his disciples entered .
now Judas , who betrayed him , also knew the place , for Jesus often met there with his disciples .
Judas then , having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , came there with lanterns , torches , and weapons .
Jesus therefore , knowing all the things that were happening to him , went forth , and said to them , " Who are you looking for ? "
they answered him , " Jesus of Nazareth . " Jesus said to them , " I am he . " Judas also , who betrayed him , was standing with them .
when therefore he said to them , " I am he , " they went backward , and fell to the ground .
again therefore he asked them , " Who are you looking for ? " they said , " Jesus of Nazareth . "
Jesus answered , " I told you that I am he . if therefore you seek me , let these go their way , "
that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke , " Of those whom you have given me , I have lost none . "
Simon Peter therefore , having a sword , drew it , and struck the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was Malchus .
Jesus therefore said to Peter , " Put the sword into its sheath . the cup which the Father has given me , shall I not surely drink it ? "
so the detachment , the commanding officer , and the officers of the Jews , seized Jesus and bound him ,
and led him to Annas first , for he was father @-@ in @-@ law to Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people .
Simon Peter followed Jesus , as did another disciple . now that disciple was known to the high priest , and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ;
but Peter was standing at the door outside . so the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to her who kept the door , and brought in Peter .
then the maid who kept the door said to Peter , " Are you also one of this man 's disciples ? " he said , " I am not . "
now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of coals , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
the high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples , and about his teaching .
Jesus answered him , " I spoke openly to the world . I always taught in synagogues , and in the temple , where the Jews always meet . I said nothing in secret .
why do you ask me ? ask those who have heard me what I said to them . behold , these know the things which I said . "
when he had said this , one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand , saying , " Do you answer the high priest like that ? "
Jesus answered him , " If I have spoken evil , testify of the evil ; but if well , why do you beat me ? "
Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas , the high priest .
now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . they said therefore to him , " You aren 't also one of his disciples , are you ? " he denied it , and said , " I am not . "
one of the servants of the high priest , being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off , said , " Didn 't I see you in the garden with him ? "
Peter therefore denied it again , and immediately the rooster crowed .
they led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium . it was early , and they themselves didn 't enter into the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
Pilate therefore went out to them , and said , " What accusation do you bring against this man ? "
they answered him , " If this man weren 't an evildoer , we wouldn 't have delivered him up to you . "
Pilate therefore said to them , " Take him yourselves , and judge him according to your law . " therefore the Jews said to him , " It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death , "
that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spoke , signifying by what kind of death he should die .
Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium , called Jesus , and said to him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? "
Jesus answered him , " Do you say this by yourself , or did others tell you about me ? "
Pilate answered , " I 'm not a Jew , am I ? your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me . what have you done ? "
Pilate said to him , " What is truth ? " when he had said this , he went out again to the Jews , and said to them , " I find no basis for a charge against him .
but you have a custom , that I should release someone to you at the Passover . therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? "
then they all shouted again , saying , " Not this man , but Barabbas ! " now Barabbas was a robber .
so Pilate then took Jesus , and flogged him .
the soldiers twisted thorns into a crown , and put it on his head , and dressed him in a purple garment .
they kept saying , " hail , King of the Jews ! " and they kept slapping him .
then Pilate went out again , and said to them , " behold , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
Jesus therefore came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . Pilate said to them , " behold , the man ! "
the Jews answered him , " We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . "
when therefore Pilate heard this saying , he was more afraid .
he entered into the Praetorium again , and said to Jesus , " Where are you from ? " but Jesus gave him no answer .
Pilate therefore said to him , " Aren 't you speaking to me ? Don 't you know that I have power to release you , and have power to crucify you ? "
Jesus answered , " You would have no power at all against me , unless it were given to you from above . therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin . "
when Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pavement , " but in Hebrew , " Gabbatha . "
now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover , at about the sixth hour . he said to the Jews , " behold , your King ! "
so then he delivered him to them to be crucified . so they took Jesus and led him away .
he went out , bearing his cross , to the place called " The Place of a skull , " which is called in Hebrew , " golgotha , "
where they crucified him , and with him two others , on either side one , and Jesus in the middle .
Pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . there was written , " Jesus of NAZARETH , the King of the Jews . "
therefore many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , in Latin , and in Greek .
the chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate , " Don 't write , ' The King of the Jews , ' but , ' he said , I am King of the Jews . ' "
Pilate answered , " What I have written , I have written . "
but there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
therefore when Jesus saw his mother , and the disciple whom he loved standing there , he said to his mother , " Woman , behold your son ! "
then he said to the disciple , " behold , your mother ! " from that hour , the disciple took her to his own home .
after this , Jesus , seeing that all things were now finished , that the Scripture might be fulfilled , said , " I am thirsty . "
now a vessel full of vinegar was set there ; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop , and held it at his mouth .
when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , " It is finished . " he bowed his head , and gave up his spirit .
therefore the soldiers came , and broke the legs of the first , and of the other who was crucified with him ;
but when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was already dead , they didn 't break his legs .
however one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came out .
he who has seen has testified , and his testimony is true . he knows that he tells the truth , that you may believe .
for these things happened , that the Scripture might be fulfilled , " A bone of him will not be broken . "
again another Scripture says , " They will look on him whom they pierced . "
Nicodemus , who at first came to Jesus by night , also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred Roman pounds .
so they took Jesus ' body , and bound it in linen cloths with the spices , as the custom of the Jews is to bury .
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden . in the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid .
then because of the Jews ' Preparation Day ( for the tomb was near at hand ) they laid Jesus there .
now on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene went early , while it was still dark , to the tomb , and saw the stone taken away from the tomb .
therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved , and said to them , " They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we don 't know where they have laid him ! "
therefore Peter and the other disciple went out , and they went toward the tomb .
they both ran together . the other disciple outran Peter , and came to the tomb first .
Stooping and looking in , he saw the linen cloths lying , yet he didn 't enter in .
so then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in , and he saw and believed .
for as yet they didn 't know the Scripture , that he must rise from the dead .
so the disciples went away again to their own homes .
but Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping . so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ,
and she saw two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
they told her , " Woman , why are you weeping ? " she said to them , " Because they have taken away my Lord , and I don 't know where they have laid him . "
when she had said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing , and didn 't know that it was Jesus .
Jesus said to her , " Mary . " she turned and said to him , " Rabboni ! " which is to say , " Teacher ! "
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and that he had said these things to her .
when therefore it was evening , on that day , the first day of the week , and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and said to them , " Peace be to you . "
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . the disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord .
Jesus therefore said to them again , " Peace be to you . as the Father has sent me , even so I send you . "
when he had said this , he breathed on them , and said to them , " Receive the Holy Spirit !
if you forgive anyone 's sins , they have been forgiven them . if you retain anyone 's sins , they have been retained . "
but Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , wasn 't with them when Jesus came .
after eight days again his disciples were inside , and Thomas was with them . Jesus came , the doors being locked , and stood in the midst , and said , " Peace be to you . "
then he said to Thomas , " Reach here your finger , and see my hands . reach here your hand , and put it into my side . Don 't be unbelieving , but believing . "
Thomas answered him , " My Lord and my God ! "
Jesus said to him , " Because you have seen me , you have believed . blessed are those who have not seen , and have believed . "
therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book ;
but these are written , that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing you may have life in his name .
but when day had already come , Jesus stood on the beach , yet the disciples didn 't know that it was Jesus .
Jesus therefore said to them , " Children , have you anything to eat ? " they answered him , " No . "
that disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter , " It 's the Lord ! " so when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he wrapped his coat around him ( for he was naked ) , and threw himself into the sea .
but the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cubits away ) , dragging the net full of fish .
so when they got out on the land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid on it , and bread .
Jesus said to them , " Bring some of the fish which you have just caught . "
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fish , one hundred fifty @-@ three ; and even though there were so many , the net wasn 't torn .
Jesus said to them , " Come and eat breakfast . " none of the disciples dared inquire of him , " Who are you ? " knowing that it was the Lord .
then Jesus came and took the bread , gave it to them , and the fish likewise .
this is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples , after he had risen from the dead .
most certainly I tell you , when you were young , you dressed yourself , and walked where you wanted to . but when you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and another will dress you , and carry you where you don 't want to go . "
now he said this , signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God . when he had said this , he said to him , " Follow me . "
Peter seeing him , said to Jesus , " Lord , what about this man ? "
Jesus said to him , " If I desire that he stay until I come , what is that to you ? you follow me . "
this is the disciple who testifies about these things , and wrote these things . we know that his witness is true .
there are also many other things which Jesus did , which if they would all be written , I suppose that even the world itself wouldn 't have room for the books that would be written .
to these he also showed himself alive after he suffered , by many proofs , appearing to them over a period of forty days , and speaking about God 's Kingdom .
being assembled together with them , he commanded them , " Don 't depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which you heard from me .
for John indeed baptized in water , but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now . "
therefore when they had come together , they asked him , " Lord , are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel ? "
he said to them , " It isn 't for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within his own authority .
but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you . you will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem , in all Judea and Samaria , and to the uttermost parts of the earth . "
when he had said these things , as they were looking , he was taken up , and a cloud received him out of their sight .
while they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went , behold , two men stood by them in white clothing ,
then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet , which is near Jerusalem , a Sabbath day 's journey away .
when they had come in , they went up into the upper room , where they were staying ; that is Peter , John , James , Andrew , Philip , Thomas , Bartholomew , Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , Simon the Zealot , and Judas the son of James .
all these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication , along with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers .
for he was numbered with us , and received his portion in this ministry .
now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness , and falling headlong , his body burst open , and all his intestines gushed out .
it became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called ' Akeldama , ' that is , ' The field of blood . '
for it is written in the book of Psalms , ' Let his habitation be made desolate . let no one dwell therein ; ' and , ' Let another take his office . '
they put forward two , Joseph called Barsabbas , who was surnamed Justus , and Matthias .
they drew lots for them , and the lot fell on Matthias , and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles .
now when the day of Pentecost had come , they were all with one accord in one place .
suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them , and one sat on each of them .
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and began to speak with other languages , as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak .
now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews , devout men , from every nation under the sky .
when this sound was heard , the multitude came together , and were bewildered , because everyone heard them speaking in his own language .
they were all amazed and marveled , saying to one another , " behold , aren 't all these who speak Galileans ?
how do we hear , everyone in our own native language ?
they were all amazed , and were perplexed , saying one to another , " What does this mean ? "
others , mocking , said , " They are filled with new wine . "
yes , and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days , I will pour out my Spirit , and they will prophesy .
I will show wonders in the sky above , and signs on the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and billows of smoke .
the sun will be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes .
it will be , that whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved . '
" men of Israel , hear these words ! Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you , even as you yourselves know ,
him , being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God , you have taken by the hand of lawless men , crucified and killed ;
whom God raised up , having freed him from the agony of death , because it was not possible that he should be held by it .
for David says concerning him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved .
therefore my heart was glad , and my tongue rejoiced . moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope ;
because you will not leave my soul in Hades , neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay .
you made known to me the ways of life . you will make me full of gladness with your presence . '
" brothers , I may tell you freely of the patriarch David , that he both died and was buried , and his tomb is with us to this day .
therefore , being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body , according to the flesh , he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne ,
he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ , that neither was his soul left in Hades , nor did his flesh see decay .
this Jesus God raised up , to which we all are witnesses .
being therefore exalted by the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this , which you now see and hear .
for David didn 't ascend into the heavens , but he says himself , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " sit by my right hand ,
" let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ , this Jesus whom you crucified . "
now when they heard this , they were cut to the heart , and said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles , " Brothers , what shall we do ? "
Peter said to them , " repent , and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
for the promise is to you , and to your children , and to all who are far off , even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself . "
with many other words he testified , and exhorted them , saying , " Save yourselves from this crooked generation ! "
then those who gladly received his word were baptized . there were added that day about three thousand souls .
they continued steadfastly in the Apostles ' teaching and fellowship , in the breaking of bread , and prayer .
fear came on every soul , and many wonders and signs were done through the Apostles .
all who believed were together , and had all things in common .
they sold their possessions and goods , and distributed them to all , according as anyone had need .
Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer , the ninth hour .
seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple , he asked to receive gifts for the needy .
he listened to them , expecting to receive something from them .
but Peter said , " Silver and gold have I none , but what I have , that I give you . in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , get up and walk ! "
he took him by the right hand , and raised him up . immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength .
Leaping up , he stood , and began to walk . he entered with them into the temple , walking , leaping , and praising God .
they recognized him , that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple . they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him .
as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
but you denied the Holy and Righteous One , and asked for a murderer to be granted to you ,
and killed the Prince of life , whom God raised from the dead , to which we are witnesses .
" now , brothers , I know that you did this in ignorance , as did also your rulers .
but the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets , that Christ should suffer , he thus fulfilled .
whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things , which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets .
for Moses indeed said to the fathers , ' The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you .
it will be , that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people . '
yes , and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
you are the children of the prophets , and of the Covenant which God made with our fathers , saying to Abraham , ' In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed . '
God , having raised up his servant , Jesus , sent him to you first , to bless you , in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness . "
as they spoke to the people , the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them ,
being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
they laid hands on them , and put them in custody until the next day , for it was now evening .
but many of those who heard the word believed , and the number of the men came to be about five thousand .
it happened in the morning , that their rulers , elders , and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem .
Annas the high priest was there , with Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and as many as were relatives of the high priest .
when they had stood them in the middle of them , they inquired , " By what power , or in what name , have you done this ? "
then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said to them , " You rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
he is ' the stone which was regarded as worthless by you , the builders , which has become the head of the corner . '
there is salvation in none other , for neither is there any other name under heaven , that is given among men , by which we must be saved ! "
now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marveled . they recognized that they had been with Jesus .
seeing the man who was healed standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
saying , " What shall we do to these men ? because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them , as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem , and we can 't deny it .
but so that this spreads no further among the people , let 's threaten them , that from now on they don 't speak to anyone in this name . "
they called them , and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus .
but Peter and John answered them , " Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , judge for yourselves ,
for we can 't help telling the things which we saw and heard . "
when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding no way to punish them , because of the people ; for everyone glorified God for that which was done .
for the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old .
being let go , they came to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them .
when they heard it , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , " O Lord , you are God , who made the heaven , the earth , the sea , and all that is in them ;
who by the mouth of your servant , David , said , ' Why do the nations rage , and the peoples plot a vain thing ?
the kings of the earth take a stand , and the rulers take council together , against the Lord , and against his Christ . '
now , Lord , look at their threats , and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness ,
while you stretch out your hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus . "
when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they spoke the word of God with boldness .
with great power , the Apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus . great grace was on them all .
but a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira , his wife , sold a possession ,
but Peter said , " Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
Ananias , hearing these words , fell down and died . great fear came on all who heard these things .
the young men arose and wrapped him up , and they carried him out and buried him .
about three hours later , his wife , not knowing what had happened , came in .
Peter answered her , " Tell me whether you sold the land for so much . " she said , " Yes , for so much . "
she fell down immediately at his feet , and died . the young men came in and found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her by her husband .
great fear came on the whole assembly , and on all who heard these things .
by the hands of the Apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people . they were all with one accord in Solomon 's porch .
none of the rest dared to join them , however the people honored them .
more believers were added to the Lord , multitudes of both men and women .
multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem , bringing sick people , and those who were tormented by unclean spirits : and they were all healed .
but the high priest rose up , and all those who were with him ( which is the sect of the Sadducees ) , and they were filled with jealousy ,
now when the high priest , the captain of the temple , and the chief priests heard these words , they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this .
one came and told them , " behold , the men whom you put in prison are in the temple , standing and teaching the people . "
then the captain went with the officers , and brought them without violence , for they were afraid that the people might stone them .
but Peter and the Apostles answered , " We must obey God rather than men .
the God of our fathers raised up Jesus , whom you killed , hanging him on a tree .
God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior , to give repentance to Israel , and remission of sins .
we are His witnesses of these things ; and so also is the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to those who obey him . "
but they , when they heard this , were cut to the heart , and determined to kill them .
now I tell you , withdraw from these men , and leave them alone . for if this counsel or this work is of men , it will be overthrown .
they agreed with him . summoning the Apostles , they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
they therefore departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for Jesus ' name .
every day , in the temple and at home , they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus , the Christ .
the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said , " It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables .
therefore select from among you , brothers , seven men of good report , full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
but we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word . "
the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly . a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
Stephen , full of faith and power , performed great wonders and signs among the people .
but some of those who were of the synagogue called " The Libertines , " and of the Cyrenians , of the Alexandrians , and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose , disputing with Stephen .
they weren 't able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke .
then they secretly induced men to say , " We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God . "
they stirred up the people , the elders , and the scribes , and came against him and seized him , and brought him in to the council ,
and set up false witnesses who said , " This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law .
for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place , and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us . "
all who sat in the council , fastening their eyes on him , saw his face like it was the face of an angel .
the high priest said , " Are these things so ? "
then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and lived in Haran . from there , when his father was dead , God moved him into this land , where you are now living .
God spoke in this way : that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land , and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years .
'i will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage , ' said God , ' and after that will they come out , and serve me in this place . '
he gave him the Covenant of circumcision . so Abraham became the father of Isaac , and circumcised him the eighth day . Isaac became the father of Jacob , and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs .
now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan , and great affliction . our fathers found no food .
but when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent out our fathers the first time .
on the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers , and Joseph 's race was revealed to Pharaoh .
Jacob went down into Egypt , and he died , himself and our fathers ,
and they were brought back to Shechem , and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem .
" but as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham , the people grew and multiplied in Egypt ,
until there arose a different king , who didn 't know Joseph .
the same took advantage of our race , and mistreated our fathers , and forced them to throw out their babies , so that they wouldn 't stay alive .
Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians . he was mighty in his words and works .
but when he was forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brothers , the children of Israel .
seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him who was oppressed , striking the Egyptian .
he supposed that his brothers understood that God , by his hand , was giving them deliverance ; but they didn 't understand .
" the day following , he appeared to them as they fought , and urged them to be at peace again , saying , ' Sirs , you are brothers . why do you wrong one another ? '
but he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away , saying , ' Who made you a ruler and a judge over us ?
do you want to kill me , as you killed the Egyptian yesterday ? '
Moses fled at this saying , and became a stranger in the land of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
" when forty years were fulfilled , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai , in a flame of fire in a bush .
the Lord said to him , ' Take your sandals off of your feet , for the place where you stand is holy ground .
I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their groaning . I have come down to deliver them . now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
this man led them out , having worked wonders and signs in Egypt , in the Red Sea , and in the wilderness for forty years .
this is that Moses , who said to the children of Israel , ' The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . '
to whom our fathers wouldn 't be obedient , but rejected him , and turned back in their hearts to Egypt ,
saying to Aaron , ' Make us gods that will go before us , for as for this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don 't know what has become of him . '
they made a calf in those days , and brought a sacrifice to the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their hands .
you took up the tabernacle of Moloch , the star of your god Rephan , the figures which you made to worship . I will carry you away beyond Babylon . '
" our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness , even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen ;
who found favor in the sight of God , and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob .
but Solomon built him a house .
" you stiff @-@ necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , you always resist the Holy Spirit ! as your fathers did , so you do .
now when they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed at him with their teeth .
but he , being full of the Holy Spirit , looked up steadfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
and said , " behold , I see the heavens opened , and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God ! "
but they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and rushed at him with one accord .
they threw him out of the city , and stoned him . the witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul .
they stoned Stephen as he called out , saying , " Lord Jesus , receive my spirit ! "
he kneeled down , and cried with a loud voice , " Lord , don 't hold this sin against them ! " when he had said this , he fell asleep .
Saul was consenting to his death . a great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day . they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria , except for the Apostles .
devout men buried Stephen , and lamented greatly over him .
but Saul ravaged the assembly , entering into every house , and dragged both men and women off to prison .
therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word .
Philip went down to the city of Samaria , and proclaimed to them the Christ .
the multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
for unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them . they came out , crying with a loud voice . many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed .
there was great joy in that city .
to whom they all listened , from the least to the greatest , saying , " This man is that great power of God . "
they listened to him , because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries .
but when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
Simon himself also believed . being baptized , he continued with Philip . seeing signs and great miracles occurring , he was amazed .
now when the Apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them ,
who , when they had come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Spirit ;
for as yet he had fallen on none of them . they had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus .
then they laid their hands on them , and they received the Holy Spirit .
but Peter said to him , " May your silver perish with you , because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money !
you have neither part nor lot in this matter , for your heart isn 't right before God .
repent therefore of this , your wickedness , and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you .
for I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity . "
Simon answered , " pray for me to the Lord , that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me . "
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans .
but an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip , saying , " arise , and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza . this is a desert . "
he arose and went ; and behold , there was a man of Ethiopia , a eunuch of great authority under Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , who was over all her treasure , who had come to Jerusalem to worship .
he was returning and sitting in his chariot , and was reading the prophet Isaiah .
Philip ran to him , and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet , and said , " Do you understand what you are reading ? "
he said , " How can I , unless someone explains it to me ? " he begged Philip to come up and sit with him .
now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this , " He was led as a sheep to the slaughter . as a lamb before his shearer is silent , so he doesn 't open his mouth .
in his humiliation , his judgment was taken away . who will declare His generation ? for his life is taken from the earth . "
the eunuch answered Philip , " Who is the prophet talking about ? about himself , or about someone else ? "
Philip opened his mouth , and beginning from this Scripture , preached to him Jesus .
as they went on the way , they came to some water , and the eunuch said , " behold , here is water . what is keeping me from being baptized ? "
he commanded the chariot to stand still , and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the eunuch , and he baptized him .
when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away , and the eunuch didn 't see him any more , for he went on his way rejoicing .
but Philip was found at Azotus . passing through , he preached the Good News to all the cities , until he came to Caesarea .
as he traveled , it happened that he got close to Damascus , and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him .
he fell on the earth , and heard a voice saying to him , " Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? "
he said , " Who are you , Lord ? " the Lord said , " I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting .
but rise up , and enter into the city , and you will be told what you must do . "
the men who traveled with him stood speechless , hearing the sound , but seeing no one .
Saul arose from the ground , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no one . they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
he was without sight for three days , and neither ate nor drank .
now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias . the Lord said to him in a vision , " Ananias ! " he said , " behold , it 's me , Lord . "
the Lord said to him , " arise , and go to the street which is called straight , and inquire in the house of Judah for one named Saul , a man of Tarsus . for behold , he is praying ,
and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in , and laying his hands on him , that he might receive his sight . "
but Ananias answered , " Lord , I have heard from many about this man , how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem .
here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name . "
but the Lord said to him , " Go your way , for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings , and the children of Israel .
for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name 's sake . "
immediately something like scales fell from his eyes , and he received his sight . he arose and was baptized .
he took food and was strengthened . Saul stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus .
immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ , that he is the Son of God .
but Saul increased more in strength , and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus , proving that this is the Christ .
when many days were fulfilled , the Jews conspired together to kill him ,
but their plot became known to Saul . they watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him ,
but his disciples took him by night , and let him down through the wall , lowering him in a basket .
when Saul had come to Jerusalem , he tried to join himself to the disciples ; but they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
he was with them entering into Jerusalem ,
preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus . he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists , but they were seeking to kill him .
when the brothers knew it , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him off to Tarsus .
so the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace , and were built up . they were multiplied , walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit .
it happened , as Peter went throughout all those parts , he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda .
there he found a certain man named Aeneas , who had been bedridden for eight years , because he was paralyzed .
Peter said to him , " Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you . get up and make your bed ! " immediately he arose .
all who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which when translated , means Dorcas . this woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did .
it happened in those days that she fell sick , and died . when they had washed her , they laid her in an upper room .
as Lydda was near Joppa , the disciples , hearing that Peter was there , sent two men to him , imploring him not to delay in coming to them .
Peter put them all out , and kneeled down and prayed . turning to the body , he said , " Tabitha , get up ! " she opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
he gave her his hand , and raised her up . calling the saints and widows , he presented her alive .
and it became known throughout all Joppa , and many believed in the Lord .
it happened , that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon , a tanner .
now there was a certain man in Caesarea , Cornelius by name , a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment ,
a devout man , and one who feared God with all his house , who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people , and always prayed to God .
at about the ninth hour of the day , he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him , and saying to him , " Cornelius ! "
now send men to Joppa , and get Simon , who is surnamed Peter .
he lodges with one Simon , a tanner , whose house is by the seaside . "
when the angel who spoke to him had departed , Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually .
having explained everything to them , he sent them to Joppa .
now on the next day as they were on their journey , and got close to the city , Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon .
he became hungry and desired to eat , but while they were preparing , he fell into a trance .
he saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him , like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth ,
in which were all kinds of four @-@ footed animals of the earth , wild animals , reptiles , and birds of the sky .
but Peter said , " Not so , Lord ; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean . "
a voice came to him again the second time , " What God has cleansed , you must not call unclean . "
this was done three times , and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven .
now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , behold , the men who were sent by Cornelius , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
and called and asked whether Simon , who was surnamed Peter , was lodging there .
while Peter was pondering the vision , the Spirit said to him , " behold , three men seek you .
but arise , get down , and go with them , doubting nothing ; for I have sent them . "
Peter went down to the men , and said , " behold , I am he whom you seek . why have you come ? "
so he called them in and lodged them . on the next day Peter arose and went out with them , and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him .
on the next day they entered into Caesarea . Cornelius was waiting for them , having called together his relatives and his near friends .
when it happened that Peter entered , Cornelius met him , fell down at his feet , and worshiped him .
but Peter raised him up , saying , " Stand up ! I myself am also a man . "
as he talked with him , he went in and found many gathered together .
therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for . I ask therefore , why did you send for me ? "
Cornelius said , " Four days ago , I was fasting until this hour , and at the ninth hour , I prayed in my house , and behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
and said , ' Cornelius , your prayer is heard , and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God .
send therefore to Joppa , and summon Simon , who is surnamed Peter . he lodges in the house of Simon a tanner , by the seaside . when he comes , he will speak to you . '
the word which he sent to the children of Israel , preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ--he is Lord of all--
we are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they also killed , hanging him on a tree .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead .
all the prophets testify about him , that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins . "
while Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word .
they of the circumcision who believed were amazed , as many as came with Peter , because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles .
he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . then they asked him to stay some days .
now the Apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God .
when Peter had come up to Jerusalem , those who were of the circumcision contended with him ,
saying , " You went in to uncircumcised men , and ate with them ! "
but Peter began , and explained to them in order , saying ,
when I had looked intently at it , I considered , and saw the four @-@ footed animals of the earth , wild animals , creeping things , and birds of the sky .
I also heard a voice saying to me , ' Rise , Peter , kill and eat ! '
but I said , ' Not so , Lord , for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth . '
but a voice answered me the second time out of heaven , ' What God has cleansed , don 't you call unclean . '
this was done three times , and all were drawn up again into heaven .
behold , immediately three men stood before the house where I was , having been sent from Caesarea to me .
the Spirit told me to go with them , without discriminating . these six brothers also accompanied me , and we entered into the man 's house .
he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house , and saying to him , ' Send to Joppa , and get Simon , whose surname is Peter ,
who will speak to you words by which you will be saved , you and all your house . '
as I began to speak , the Holy Spirit fell on them , even as on us at the beginning .
I remembered the word of the Lord , how he said , ' John indeed baptized in water , but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit . '
if then God gave to them the same gift as us , when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I , that I could withstand God ? "
they therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , speaking the word to no one except to Jews only .
but there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who , when they had come to Antioch , spoke to the Hellenists , preaching the Lord Jesus .
the hand of the Lord was with them , and a great number believed and turned to the Lord .
the report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem . they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch ,
now in these days , prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
one of them named Agabus stood up , and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world , which also happened in the days of Claudius .
as any of the disciples had plenty , each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea ;
which they also did , sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul .
now about that time , King Herod stretched out his hands to oppress some of the assembly .
he killed James , the brother of John , with the sword .
when he saw that it pleased the Jews , he proceeded to seize Peter also . this was during the days of unleavened bread .
when he had arrested him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him , intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover .
Peter therefore was kept in the prison , but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him .
the same night when Herod was about to bring him out , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains . guards in front of the door kept the prison .
the angel said to him , " Get dressed and put on your sandals . " he did so . he said to him , " Put on your cloak , and follow me . "
and he went out and followed him . he didn 't know that what was being done by the angel was real , but thought he saw a vision .
thinking about that , he came to the house of Mary , the mother of John whose surname was Mark , where many were gathered together and were praying .
when Peter knocked at the door of the gate , a maid named Rhoda came to answer .
when she recognized Peter 's voice , she didn 't open the gate for joy , but ran in , and reported that Peter was standing in front of the gate .
they said to her , " You are crazy ! " but she insisted that it was so . they said , " It is his angel . "
but Peter continued knocking . when they had opened , they saw him , and were amazed .
now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter .
when Herod had sought for him , and didn 't find him , he examined the guards , and commanded that they should be put to death . he went down from Judea to Caesarea , and stayed there .
on an appointed day , Herod dressed himself in royal clothing , sat on the throne , and gave a speech to them .
the people shouted , " The voice of a god , and not of a man ! "
immediately an angel of the Lord struck him , because he didn 't give God the glory , and he was eaten by worms and died .
but the word of God grew and multiplied .
Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their service , also taking with them John whose surname was Mark .
now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers : Barnabas , Simeon who was called Niger , Lucius of Cyrene , Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
as they served the Lord and fasted , the Holy Spirit said , " separate Barnabas and Saul for me , for the work to which I have called them . "
then , when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
so , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia . from there they sailed to Cyprus .
when they were at Salamis , they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues . they had also John as their attendant .
when they had gone through the island to Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Bar Jesus ,
then the proconsul , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the teaching of the Lord .
now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos , and came to Perga in Pamphylia . John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem .
but they , passing on from Perga , came to Antioch of Pisidia . they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and sat down .
after the reading of the law and the prophets , the rulers of the synagogue sent to them , saying , " Brothers , if you have any word of exhortation for the people , speak . "
Paul stood up , and beckoning with his hand said , " Men of Israel , and you who fear God , listen .
afterward they asked for a king , and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
from this man 's seed , God has brought salvation to Israel according to his promise ,
before his coming , when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to Israel .
as John was fulfilling his course , he said , ' What do you suppose that I am ? I am not he . but behold , one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie . '
brothers , children of the stock of Abraham , and those among you who fear God , the word of this salvation is sent out to you .
for those who dwell in Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they didn 't know him , nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath , fulfilled them by condemning him .
though they found no cause for death , they still asked Pilate to have him killed .
when they had fulfilled all things that were written about him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a tomb .
but God raised him from the dead ,
and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are his witnesses to the people .
" concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has spoken thus : ' I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . '
therefore he says also in another psalm , ' You will not allow your Holy One to see decay . '
for David , after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God , fell asleep , and was laid with his fathers , and saw decay .
but he whom God raised up saw no decay .
so when the Jews went out of the synagogue , the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath .
now when the synagogue broke up , many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas ; who , speaking to them , urged them to continue in the grace of God .
the next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God .
but when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with jealousy , and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul , and blasphemed .
for so has the Lord commanded us , saying , ' I have set you as a light for the Gentiles , that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth . ' "
as the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of God . as many as were appointed to eternal life believed .
the Lord 's word was spread abroad throughout all the region .
but the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city , and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and threw them out of their borders .
but they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came to Iconium .
the disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit .
it happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews , and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed .
but the disbelieving Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers .
but the multitude of the city was divided . part sided with the Jews , and part with the Apostles .
when some of both the Gentiles and the Jews , with their rulers , made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them ,
they became aware of it , and fled to the cities of Lycaonia , Lystra , Derbe , and the surrounding region .
at Lystra a certain man sat , impotent in his feet , a cripple from his mother 's womb , who never had walked .
when the multitude saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice , saying in the language of Lycaonia , " The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men ! "
they called Barnabas " Jupiter , " and Paul " Mercury , " because he was the chief speaker .
the priest of Jupiter , whose temple was in front of their city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates , and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes .
but when the Apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of it , they tore their clothes , and sprang into the multitude , crying out ,
who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways .
yet he didn 't leave himself without witness , in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness . "
even saying these things , they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them .
but some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there , and having persuaded the multitudes , they stoned Paul , and dragged him out of the city , supposing that he was dead .
but as the disciples stood around him , he rose up , and entered into the city . on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe .
when they had appointed elders for them in every assembly , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they had believed .
they passed through Pisidia , and came to Pamphylia .
when they had spoken the word in Perga , they went down to Attalia .
from there they sailed to Antioch , from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled .
when they had arrived , and had gathered the assembly together , they reported all the things that God had done with them , and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations .
they stayed there with the disciples for a long time .
some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers , " Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses , you can 't be saved . "
therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them , they appointed Paul and Barnabas , and some others of them , to go up to Jerusalem to the Apostles and elders about this question .
they , being sent on their way by the assembly , passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles . they caused great joy to all the brothers .
when they had come to Jerusalem , they were received by the assembly and the Apostles and the elders , and they reported all things that God had done with them .
but some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up , saying , " It is necessary to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the law of Moses . "
the Apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter .
God , who knows the heart , testified about them , giving them the Holy Spirit , just like he did to us .
he made no distinction between us and them , cleansing their hearts by faith .
now therefore why do you tempt God , that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
but we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus , just as they are . "
all the multitude kept silence , and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the nations through them .
after they were silent , James answered , " Brothers , listen to me .
Simeon has reported how God first visited the nations , to take out of them a people for his name .
that the rest of men may seek after the Lord ; All the Gentiles who are called by my name , Says the Lord , who does all these things .
" therefore my judgment is that we don 't trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God ,
but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols , from sexual immorality , from what is strangled , and from blood .
for Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him , being read in the synagogues every Sabbath . "
they wrote these things by their hand : " the Apostles , the elders , and the brothers , to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch , Syria , and Cilicia : greetings .
because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words , unsettling your souls , saying , ' You must be circumcised and keep the law , ' to whom we gave no commandment ;
it seemed good to us , having come to one accord , to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
we have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth .
so , when they were sent off , they came to Antioch . having gathered the multitude together , they delivered the letter .
when they had read it , they rejoiced over the encouragement .
Judas and Silas , also being prophets themselves , encouraged the brothers with many words , and strengthened them .
after they had spent some time there , they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the Apostles .
but Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
after some days Paul said to Barnabas , " Let 's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord , to see how they are doing . "
Barnabas planned to take John , who was called Mark , with them also .
but Paul didn 't think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia , and didn 't go with them to do the work .
then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other . Barnabas took Mark with him , and sailed away to Cyprus ,
but Paul chose Silas , and went out , being commended by the brothers to the grace of God .
he went through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the assemblies .
he came to Derbe and Lystra : and behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timothy , the son of a Jewess who believed ; but his father was a Greek .
the brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him .
Paul wanted to have him go out with him , and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts ; for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
as they went on their way through the cities , they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the Apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem .
so the assemblies were strengthened in the faith , and increased in number daily .
when they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia , they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia .
when they had come opposite Mysia , they tried to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit didn 't allow them .
passing by Mysia , they came down to Troas .
a vision appeared to Paul in the night . there was a man of Macedonia standing , begging him , and saying , " Come over into Macedonia and help us . "
when he had seen the vision , immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia , concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them .
setting sail therefore from Troas , we made a straight course to Samothrace , and the day following to Neapolis ;
and from there to Philippi , which is a city of Macedonia , the foremost of the district , a Roman colony . we were staying some days in this city .
on the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside , where we supposed there was a place of prayer , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
it happened , as we were going to prayer , that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us , who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling .
following Paul and us , she cried out , " These men are servants of the Most High God , who proclaim to us a way of salvation ! "
but when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they seized Paul and Silas , and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers .
the multitude rose up together against them , and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them , and commanded them to be beaten with rods .
when they had laid many stripes on them , they threw them into prison , charging the jailer to keep them safely ,
who , having received such a command , threw them into the inner prison , and secured their feet in the stocks .
but about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the prisoners were listening to them .
suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken ; and immediately all the doors were opened , and everyone 's bonds were loosened .
the jailer , being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open , drew his sword and was about to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had escaped .
but Paul cried with a loud voice , saying , " Don 't harm yourself , for we are all here ! "
he called for lights and sprang in , and , fell down trembling before Paul and Silas ,
and brought them out and said , " Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? "
they said , " Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ , and you will be saved , you and your household . "
they spoke the word of the Lord to him , and to all who were in his house .
he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes , and was immediately baptized , he and all his household .
he brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and rejoiced greatly , with all his household , having believed in God .
but when it was day , the magistrates sent the sergeants , saying , " Let those men go . "
the jailer reported these words to Paul , saying , " The magistrates have sent to let you go ; now therefore come out , and go in peace . "
the sergeants reported these words to the magistrates , and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans ,
and they came and begged them . when they had brought them out , they asked them to depart from the city .
they went out of the prison , and entered into Lydia 's house . when they had seen the brothers , they encouraged them , and departed .
now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where there was a Jewish synagogue .
Paul , as was his custom , went in to them , and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures ,
explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead , and saying , " This Jesus , whom I proclaim to you , is the Christ . "
some of them were persuaded , and joined Paul and Silas , of the devout Greeks a great multitude , and not a few of the chief women .
when they didn 't find them , they dragged Jason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city , crying , " These who have turned the world Upside down have come here also ,
whom Jason has received . these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , Jesus ! "
the multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things .
when they had taken security from Jason and the rest , they let them go .
the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea . when they arrived , they went into the Jewish synagogue .
now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind , examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so .
many of them therefore believed ; also of the prominent Greek women , and not a few men .
but when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also , they came there likewise , agitating the multitudes .
then the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea , and Silas and Timothy still stayed there .
but those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens . receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly , they departed .
now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols .
so he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons , and in the marketplace every day with those who met him .
they took hold of him , and brought him to the Areopagus , saying , " May we know what this new teaching is , which is spoken by you ?
for you bring certain strange things to our ears . we want to know therefore what these things mean . "
now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to hear some new thing .
Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus , and said , " You men of Athens , I perceive that you are very religious in all things .
for as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an altar with this inscription : ' to an unknown God . ' what therefore you worship in ignorance , this I announce to you .
the God who made the world and all things in it , he , being Lord of heaven and earth , doesn 't dwell in temples made with hands ,
he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth , having determined appointed seasons , and the boundaries of their dwellings ,
that they should seek the Lord , if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
'For in him we live , and move , and have our being . ' as some of your own poets have said , ' For we are also his offspring . '
being then the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold , or silver , or stone , engraved by art and design of man .
the times of ignorance therefore God overlooked . but now he commands that all people everywhere should repent ,
because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained ; of which he has given assurance to all men , in that he has raised him from the dead . "
now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked ; but others said , " We want to hear you again concerning this . "
thus Paul went out from among them .
but certain men joined with him , and believed , among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
after these things Paul departed from Athens , and came to Corinth .
he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath , and persuaded Jews and Greeks .
but when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia , Paul was compelled by the Spirit , testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ .
he departed there , and went into the house of a certain man named Justus , one who worshiped God , whose house was next door to the synagogue .
Crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord with all his house . many of the Corinthians , when they heard , believed and were baptized .
the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision , " Don 't be afraid , but speak and don 't be silent ;
for I am with you , and no one will attack you to harm you , for I have many people in this city . "
he lived there a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
but when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat ,
saying , " This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law . "
but if they are questions about words and names and your own law , look to it yourselves . for I don 't want to be a judge of these matters . "
he drove them from the judgment seat .
then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . Gallio didn 't care about any of these things .
he came to Ephesus , and he left them there ; but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
when they asked him to stay with them a longer time , he declined ;
but taking his leave of them , and saying , " I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem , but I will return again to you if God Wills , " he set sail from Ephesus .
when he had landed at Caesarea , he went up and greeted the assembly , and went down to Antioch .
having spent some time there , he departed , and went through the region of Galatia , and Phrygia , in order , establishing all the disciples .
now a certain Jew named Apollos , an Alexandrian by race , an eloquent man , came to Ephesus . he was mighty in the Scriptures .
this man had been instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in spirit , he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus , although he knew only the baptism of John .
he began to speak boldly in the synagogue . but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him aside , and explained to him the way of God more accurately .
for he powerfully refuted the Jews , publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ .
he said , " Into what then were you baptized ? " they said , " Into John 's baptism . "
Paul said , " John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance , saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him , that is , in Jesus . "
when they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
when Paul had laid his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came on them , and they spoke with other languages and prophesied .
they were about twelve men in all .
he entered into the synagogue , and spoke boldly for a period of three months , reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God .
this continued for two years , so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks .
God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul ,
so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick , and the evil spirits went out .
there were seven sons of one Sceva , a Jewish chief priest , who did this .
the evil spirit answered , " Jesus I know , and Paul I know , but who are you ? "
the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them , and overpowered them , and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
this became known to all , both Jews and Greeks , who lived at Ephesus . fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
many also of those who had believed came , confessing , and declaring their deeds .
many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . they counted their price , and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver .
so the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty .
now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him , Timothy and Erastus , he himself stayed in Asia for a while .
about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way .
for a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of Artemis , brought no little business to the craftsmen ,
whom he gathered together , with the workmen of like occupation , and said , " Sirs , you know that by this business we have our wealth .
when they heard this they were filled with anger , and cried out , saying , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
the whole city was filled with confusion , and they rushed with one accord into the theater , having seized Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul 's companions in travel .
when Paul wanted to enter in to the people , the disciples didn 't allow him .
certain also of the Asiarchs , being his friends , sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater .
some therefore cried one thing , and some another , for the assembly was in confusion . most of them didn 't know why they had come together .
they brought Alexander out of the multitude , the Jews putting him forward . Alexander beckoned with his hand , and would have made a defense to the people .
but when they perceived that he was a Jew , all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
seeing then that these things can 't be denied , you ought to be quiet , and to do nothing rash .
for you have brought these men here , who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess .
if therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone , the courts are open , and there are proconsuls . let them press charges against one another .
but if you seek anything about other matters , it will be settled in the regular assembly .
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wouldn 't be able to give an account of this commotion . "
when he had thus spoken , he dismissed the assembly .
after the uproar had ceased , Paul sent for the disciples , took leave of them , and departed to go into Macedonia .
when he had gone through those parts , and had encouraged them with many words , he came into Greece .
when he had spent three months there , and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria , he determined to return through Macedonia .
but these had gone ahead , and were waiting for us at Troas .
we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread , and came to them at Troas in five days , where we stayed seven days .
on the first day of the week , when the disciples were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , intending to depart on the next day , and continued his speech until midnight .
there were many lights in the upper room where we were gathered together .
a certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window , weighed down with deep sleep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sleep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
Paul went down , and fell upon him , and embracing him said , " Don 't be troubled , for his life is in him . "
when he had gone up , and had broken bread , and eaten , and had talked with them a long while , even until break of day , he departed .
they brought the boy in alive , and were greatly comforted .
but we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos , intending to take Paul aboard there , for he had so arranged , intending himself to go by land .
when he met us at Assos , we took him aboard , and came to Mitylene .
sailing from there , we came the following day opposite Chios . the next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium , and the day after we came to Miletus .
for Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was hastening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .
from Miletus he sent to Ephesus , and called to himself the elders of the assembly .
serving the Lord with all humility , with many tears , and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews ;
how I didn 't shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable , teaching you publicly and from house to house ,
testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus .
now , behold , I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem , not knowing what will happen to me there ;
except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me .
" now , behold , I know that you all , among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God , will see my face no more .
therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men ,
for I didn 't shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God .
for I know that after my departure , vicious wolves will enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
men will arise from among your own selves , speaking perverse things , to draw away the disciples after them .
therefore watch , remembering that for a period of three years I didn 't cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears .
I coveted no one 's silver , or gold , or clothing .
you yourselves know that these hands served my necessities , and those who were with me .
when he had spoken these things , he knelt down and prayed with them all .
they all wept a lot , and fell on Paul 's neck and kissed him ,
sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken , that they should see his face no more . and they accompanied him to the ship .
when it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail , we came with a straight course to Cos , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia , we went aboard , and set sail .
when we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left hand , we sailed to Syria , and landed at Tyre , for there the ship was to unload her cargo .
having found disciples , we stayed there seven days . these said to Paul through the Spirit , that he should not go up to Jerusalem .
after saying goodbye to each other , we went on board the ship , and they returned home again .
when we had finished the voyage from Tyre , we arrived at Ptolemais . we greeted the brothers , and stayed with them one day .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's companions , departed , and came to Caesarea . we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied .
as we stayed there some days , a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea .
when we heard these things , both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem .
after these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem .
some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us , bringing one Mnason of Cyprus , an early disciple , with whom we would stay .
when we had come to Jerusalem , the brothers received us gladly .
the day following , Paul went in with us to James ; and all the elders were present .
when he had greeted them , he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry .
they , when they heard it , glorified God . they said to him , " You see , brother , how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed , and they are all zealous for the law .
what then ? the assembly must certainly meet , for they will hear that you have come .
therefore do what we tell you . we have four men who have taken a vow .
when the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him ,
for they had seen Trophimus , the Ephesian , with him in the city , and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple .
all the city was moved , and the people ran together . they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple . immediately the doors were shut .
as they were trying to kill him , news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
immediately he took soldiers and centurions , and ran down to them . they , when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , stopped beating Paul .
then the commanding officer came near , arrested him , commanded him to be bound with two chains , and inquired who he was and what he had done .
some shouted one thing , and some another , among the crowd . when he couldn 't find out the truth because of the noise , he commanded him to be brought into the barracks .
when he came to the stairs , it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd ;
for the multitude of the people followed after , crying out , " away with him ! "
as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks , he asked the commanding officer , " May I speak to you ? " he said , " Do you know Greek ?
Aren 't you then the Egyptian , who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins ? "
when he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the stairs , beckoned with his hand to the people . when there was a great silence , he spoke to them in the Hebrew language , saying ,
" brothers and fathers , listen to the defense which I now make to you . "
I persecuted this Way to the death , binding and delivering into prisons both men and women .
it happened that , as I made my journey , and came close to Damascus , about noon , suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me .
I fell to the ground , and heard a voice saying to me , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? '
I answered , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' he said to me , ' I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom you persecute . '
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they didn 't understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
I said , ' What shall I do , Lord ? ' the Lord said to me , ' arise , and go into Damascus . there you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do . '
when I couldn 't see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Damascus .
he said , ' The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will , and to see the Righteous One , and to hear a voice from his mouth .
for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard .
now why do you wait ? arise , be baptized , and wash away your sins , calling on the name of the Lord . '
I said , ' Lord , they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you .
when the blood of Stephen , your witness , was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting to his death , and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him . '
they listened to him until he said that ; then they lifted up their voice , and said , " Rid the earth of this fellow , for he isn 't fit to live ! "
when they had tied him up with thongs , Paul asked the centurion who stood by , " Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman , and not found guilty ? "
when the centurion heard it , he went to the commanding officer and told him , " Watch what you are about to do , for this man is a Roman ! "
the commanding officer came and asked him , " Tell me , are you a Roman ? " he said , " Yes . "
the commanding officer answered , " I bought my citizenship for a great price . " Paul said , " But I was born a Roman . "
immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him , and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
Paul , looking steadfastly at the council , said , " Brothers , I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day . "
the high priest , Ananias , commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth .
those who stood by said , " Do you malign God 's high priest ? "
Paul said , " I didn 't know , brothers , that he was high priest . for it is written , ' You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people . ' "
when he had said this , an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees , and the assembly was divided .
for the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , nor angel , nor spirit ; but the Pharisees confess all of these .
when a great argument arose , the commanding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
the following night , the Lord stood by him , and said , " cheer up , Paul , for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem , so you must testify also at Rome . "
when it was day , some of the Jews banded together , and bound themselves under a curse , saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul .
there were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy .
they came to the chief priests and the elders , and said , " We have bound ourselves under a great curse , to taste nothing until we have killed Paul .
but Paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul .
Paul summoned one of the centurions , and said , " Bring this young man to the commanding officer , for he has something to tell him . "
so he took him , and brought him to the commanding officer , and said , " Paul , the prisoner , summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
the commanding officer took him by the hand , and going aside , asked him privately , " What is it that you have to tell me ? "
he said , " The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow , as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him .
so the commanding officer let the young man go , charging him , " Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me . "
he asked them to provide animals , that they might set Paul on one , and bring him safely to Felix the governor .
he wrote a letter like this :
" this man was seized by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them , when I came with the soldiers and rescued him , having learned that he was a Roman .
desiring to know the cause why they accused him , I brought him down to their council .
I found him to be accused about questions of their law , but not to be charged with anything worthy of death or of imprisonment .
when I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man , I sent him to you immediately , charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you . farewell . "
so the soldiers , carrying out their orders , took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris .
but on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him , and returned to the barracks .
when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor , they also presented Paul to him .
after five days , the high priest , Ananias , came down with certain elders and an orator , one Tertullus . they informed the governor against Paul .
but , that I don 't delay you , I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words .
for we have found this man to be a plague , an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes .
he even tried to profane the temple , and we arrested him .
the Jews also joined in the attack , affirming that these things were so .
when the governor had beckoned to him to speak , Paul answered , " Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years , I cheerfully make my defense ,
seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem .
in the temple they didn 't find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd , either in the synagogues , or in the city .
nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me .
having hope toward God , which these also themselves look for , that there will be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men .
now after some years , I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation , and offerings ;
amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple , not with a mob , nor with turmoil .
they ought to have been here before you , and to make accusation , if they had anything against me .
or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council ,
unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them , ' concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today ! ' "
but Felix , having more exact knowledge concerning the Way , deferred them , saying , " When Lysias , the commanding officer , comes down , I will decide your case . "
he ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
but after some days , Felix came with Drusilla , his wife , who was a Jewess , and sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus .
as he reasoned about righteousness , self @-@ control , and the judgment to come , Felix was terrified , and answered , " Go your way for this time , and when it is convenient for me , I will summon you . "
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
but when two years were fulfilled , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus , and desiring to gain favor with the Jews , Felix left Paul in bonds .
Festus therefore , having come into the province , after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
when he had stayed among them more than ten days , he went down to Caesarea , and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat , and commanded Paul to be brought .
when he had come , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove ,
while he said in his defense , " Neither against the law of the Jews , nor against the temple , nor against Caesar , have I sinned at all . "
but Festus , desiring to gain favor with the Jews , answered Paul and said , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem , and be judged by me there concerning these things ? "
but Paul said , " I am standing before Caesar 's judgment seat , where I ought to be tried . I have done no wrong to the Jews , as you also know very well .
then Festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , " You have appealed to Caesar . to Caesar you shall go . "
now when some days had passed , King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea , and greeted Festus .
as he stayed there many days , Festus laid Paul 's case before the king , saying , " There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix ;
about whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , asking for a sentence against him .
when therefore they had come together here , I didn 't delay , but on the next day sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought .
concerning whom , when the accusers stood up , they brought no charge of such things as I supposed ;
but had certain questions against him about their own religion , and about one Jesus , who was dead , whom Paul affirmed to be alive .
being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things , I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters .
but when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor , I commanded him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar . "
so on the next day , when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp , and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city , at the command of Festus , Paul was brought in .
but when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death , and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him .
for it seems to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not to also specify the charges against him . "
especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews . therefore I beg you to hear me patiently .
" indeed , all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up , which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem ;
having known me from the first , if they are willing to testify , that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers ,
which our twelve tribes , earnestly serving night and day , hope to attain . concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews , King Agrippa !
why is it judged incredible with you , if God does raise the dead ?
" I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
this I also did in Jerusalem . I both shut up many of the saints in prisons , having received authority from the chief priests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
punishing them often in all the synagogues , I tried to make them blaspheme . being exceedingly enraged against them , I persecuted them even to foreign cities .
" Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests ,
at noon , O king , I saw on the way a light from the sky , brighter than the sun , shining around me and those who traveled with me .
when we had all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? it is hard for you to kick against the goads . '
" I said , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' " he said , ' I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting .
but arise , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
" therefore , King Agrippa , I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision ,
but declared first to them of Damascus , at Jerusalem , and throughout all the country of Judea , and also to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , doing works worthy of repentance .
for this reason the Jews seized me in the temple , and tried to kill me .
how the Christ must suffer , and how , by the resurrection of the dead , he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles . "
as he thus made his defense , Festus said with a loud voice , " Paul , you are crazy ! your great learning is driving you insane ! "
but he said , " I am not crazy , most excellent Festus , but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness .
King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know that you believe . "
Agrippa said to Paul , " With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian ? "
Agrippa said to Festus , " This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar . "
when it was determined that we should sail for Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius , of the Augustan band .
embarking in a ship of Adramyttium , which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia , we put to sea ; Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
the next day , we touched at Sidon . Julius treated Paul kindly , and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself .
putting to sea from there , we sailed under the Lee of Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy , and he put us on board .
when we had sailed slowly many days , and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus , the wind not allowing us further , we sailed under the Lee of Crete , opposite Salmone .
with difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair havens , near the city of Lasea .
but the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul .
when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete , close to shore .
but before long , a stormy wind beat down from shore , which is called Euroclydon .
when the ship was caught , and couldn 't face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven along .
running under the Lee of a small island called Clauda , we were able , with difficulty , to secure the boat .
after they had hoisted it up , they used cables to help reinforce the ship . fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars , they lowered the sea anchor , and so were driven along .
as we labored exceedingly with the storm , the next day they began to throw things overboard .
on the third day , they threw out the ship 's tackle with their own hands .
when neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days , and no small storm pressed on us , all hope that we would be saved was now taken away .
when they had been long without food , Paul stood up in the middle of them , and said , " Sirs , you should have listened to me , and not have set sail from Crete , and have gotten this injury and loss .
now I exhort you to cheer up , for there will be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship .
therefore , sirs , cheer up ! for I believe God , that it will be just as it has been spoken to me .
but we must run aground on a certain island . "
but when the fourteenth night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land .
they took soundings , and found twenty fathoms . after a little while , they took soundings again , and found fifteen fathoms .
fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground , they let go four anchors from the stern , and wished for daylight .
as the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea , pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow ,
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , " Unless these stay in the ship , you can 't be saved . "
then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat , and let it fall off .
therefore I beg you to take some food , for this is for your safety ; for not a hair will perish from any of your heads . "
when he had said this , and had taken bread , he gave thanks to God in the presence of all , and he broke it , and began to eat .
then they all cheered up , and they also took food .
in all , we were two hundred seventy @-@ six souls on the ship .
when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , throwing out the wheat into the sea .
when it was day , they didn 't recognize the land , but they noticed a certain bay with a beach , and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it .
casting off the anchors , they left them in the sea , at the same time untying the rudder ropes . Hoisting up the foresail to the wind , they made for the beach .
the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , so that none of them would swim out and escape .
when we had escaped , then they learned that the island was called Malta .
the natives showed us uncommon kindness ; for they kindled a fire , and received us all , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
but when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand , they said one to another , " No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he has escaped from the sea , yet Justice has not allowed to live . "
however he shook off the creature into the fire , and wasn 't harmed .
now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island , named Publius , who received us , and courteously entertained us for three days .
it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery . Paul entered in to him , prayed , and laying his hands on him , healed him .
then when this was done , the rest also who had diseases in the island came , and were cured .
they also honored us with many honors , and when we sailed , they put on board the things that we needed .
after three months , we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island , whose sign was " The Twin Brothers . "
touching at Syracuse , we stayed there three days .
from there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium . after one day , a south wind sprang up , and on the second day we came to Puteoli ,
where we found brothers , and were entreated to stay with them for seven days . so we came to Rome .
from there the brothers , when they heard of us , came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three taverns . when Paul saw them , he thanked God , and took courage .
when we entered into Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
who , when they had examined me , desired to set me free , because there was no cause of death in me .
but when the Jews spoke against it , I was constrained to appeal to Caesar , not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation .
for this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you . for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain . "
they said to him , " We neither received letters from Judea concerning you , nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you .
but we desire to hear from you what you think . for , as concerning this sect , it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against . "
some believed the things which were spoken , and some disbelieved .
when they didn 't agree among themselves , they departed after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah , the prophet , to our fathers ,
saying , ' Go to this people , and say , in hearing , you will hear , but will in no way understand . in seeing , you will see , but will in no way perceive .
for this people 's heart has grown callous . their ears are dull of hearing . their eyes they have closed . Lest they should see with their eyes , hear with their ears , understand with their heart , and would turn again , and I would heal them . '
" be it known therefore to you , that the salvation of God is sent to the nations . they will also listen . "
Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house , and received all who were coming to him ,
preaching the Kingdom of God , and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness , without hindrance .
Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an Apostle , set apart for the Good News of God ,
through whom we received grace and apostleship , for obedience of faith among all the nations , for his name 's sake ;
among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ ;
to all who are in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
first , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world .
for I long to see you , that I may impart to you some spiritual gift , to the end that you may be established ;
that is , that I with you may be encouraged in you , each of us by the other 's faith , both yours and mine .
I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners , both to the wise and to the foolish .
so , as much as is in me , I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome .
for I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ , for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes ; for the Jew first , and also for the Greek .
for in it is revealed God 's righteousness from faith to faith . as it is written , " But the righteous shall live by faith . "
for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who suppress the truth in unrighteousness ,
because that which is known of God is revealed in them , for God revealed it to them .
for the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made , even his everlasting power and divinity ; that they may be without excuse .
because , knowing God , they didn 't glorify him as God , neither gave thanks , but became vain in their reasoning , and their senseless heart was darkened .
Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man , and of birds , and four @-@ footed animals , and creeping things .
therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness , that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves ,
who exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
for this reason , God gave them up to vile passions . for their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature .
even as they refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not fitting ;
being filled with all unrighteousness , sexual immorality , wickedness , covetousness , malice ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , evil habits , secret slanderers ,
backbiters , hateful to God , insolent , haughty , boastful , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
who , knowing the ordinance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but also approve of those who practice them .
therefore you are without excuse , O man , whoever you are who judge . for in that which you judge another , you condemn yourself . for you who judge practice the same things .
we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things .
do you think this , O man who judges those who practice such things , and do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
or do you despise the riches of his Goodness , forbearance , and patience , not knowing that the Goodness of God leads you to repentance ?
but according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath , revelation , and of the righteous judgment of God ;
who " will pay back to everyone according to their works : "
to those who by patience in well @-@ doing seek for glory , honor , and incorruptibility , eternal life ;
but to those who are self @-@ seeking , and don 't obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , will be wrath and indignation ,
for there is no partiality with God .
for as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law . as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law .
for it isn 't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God , but the doers of the law will be justified
( for when Gentiles who don 't have the law do by nature the things of the law , these , not having the law , are a law to themselves ,
in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience testifying with them , and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them )
in the day when God will judge the secrets of men , according to my Good News , by Jesus Christ .
indeed you bear the name of a Jew , and rest on the law , and glory in God ,
and know his will , and approve the things that are excellent , being instructed out of the law ,
and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
you therefore who teach another , don 't you teach yourself ? you who preach that a man shouldn 't steal , do you steal ?
you who say a man shouldn 't commit adultery . do you commit adultery ? you who abhor idols , do you rob temples ?
you who glory in the law , through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God ?
for " the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you , " just as it is written .
for circumcision indeed profits , if you are a doer of the law , but if you are a transgressor of the law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
if therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law , won 't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision ?
won 't the uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfills the law , judge you , who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law ?
for he is not a Jew who is one outwardly , neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh ;
then what advantage does the Jew have ? or what is the profit of circumcision ?
much in every way ! because first of all , they were entrusted with the oracles of God .
for what if some were without faith ? will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God ?
May it never be ! yes , let God be found true , but every man a liar . as it is written , " That you might be justified in your words , and might prevail when you come into judgment . "
but if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God , what will we say ? is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath ? I speak like men do .
May it never be ! for then how will God judge the world ?
for if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory , why am I also still judged as a sinner ?
why not ( as we are slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ) , " Let us do evil , that good may come ? " those who say so are justly condemned .
as it is written , " There is no one righteous ; no , not one .
there is no one who understands . there is no one who seeks after God .
they have all turned aside . they have together become unprofitable . there is no one who does good , no , not , so much as one . "
" their throat is an open tomb . with their tongues they have used deceit . " " the poison of vipers is under their lips " ;
" whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness . "
" their feet are swift to shed blood .
destruction and misery are in their ways .
the way of peace , they haven 't known . "
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
because by the works of the law , no flesh will be justified in his sight . for through the law comes the knowledge of sin .
but now apart from the law , a righteousness of God has been revealed , being testified by the law and the prophets ;
even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe . for there is no distinction ,
for all have sinned , and fall short of the glory of God ;
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus ;
where then is the boasting ? it is excluded . by what kind of law ? of works ? no , but by a law of faith .
we maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law .
or is God the God of Jews only ? Isn 't he the God of Gentiles also ? yes , of Gentiles also ,
since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith , and the uncircumcised through faith .
do we then nullify the law through faith ? May it never be ! no , we establish the law .
what then will we say that Abraham , our forefather , has found according to the flesh ?
for if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about , but not toward God .
for what does the Scripture say ? " Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him for righteousness . "
now to him who works , the reward is not counted as grace , but as something owed .
but to him who doesn 't work , but believes in him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is accounted for righteousness .
even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works ,
" blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven , whose sins are covered .
blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin . "
is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised , or on the uncircumcised also ? for we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness .
how then was it counted ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision , that he might be the father of all those who believe , though they might be in uncircumcision , that righteousness might also be accounted to them .
he is the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had in uncircumcision .
for the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn 't through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
for if those who are of the law are heirs , faith is made void , and the promise is made of no effect .
for the law works wrath , for where there is no law , neither is there disobedience .
who in hope believed against hope , to the end that he might become a father of many nations , according to that which had been spoken , " So will your seed be . "
without being weakened in faith , he didn 't consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the deadness of Sarah 's womb .
yet , looking to the promise of God , he didn 't waver through unbelief , but grew strong through faith , giving glory to God ,
and being fully assured that what he had promised , he was also able to perform .
therefore it also was " reckoned to him for righteousness . "
who was delivered up for our trespasses , and was raised for our justification .
being therefore justified by faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ;
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand . we rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
not only this , but we also rejoice in our sufferings , knowing that suffering works perseverance ;
and hope doesn 't disappoint us , because God 's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
for while we were yet weak , at the right time Christ died for the ungodly .
for one will hardly die for a righteous man . yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die .
but God commends his own love toward us , in that while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
much more then , being now justified by his blood , we will be saved from God 's wrath through him .
for if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we will be saved by his life .
not only so , but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received the reconciliation .
therefore as sin entered into the world through one man , and death through sin ; and so death passed to all men , because all sinned .
for until the law , sin was in the world ; but sin is not charged when there is no law .
nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses , even over those whose sins weren 't like Adam 's disobedience , who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come .
the gift is not as through one who sinned : for the judgment came by one to condemnation , but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification .
so then as through one trespass , all men were condemned ; even so through one act of righteousness , all men were justified to life .
for as through the one man 's disobedience many were made sinners , even so through the obedience of the one , many will be made righteous .
the law came in besides , that the trespass might abound ; but where sin abounded , grace abounded more exceedingly ;
that as sin reigned in death , even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
what shall we say then ? shall we continue in sin , that grace may abound ?
May it never be ! we who died to sin , how could we live in it any longer ?
or don 't you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
we were buried therefore with him through baptism to death , that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we also might walk in newness of life .
for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death , we will also be part of his resurrection ;
knowing this , that our old man was crucified with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin .
for he who has died has been freed from sin .
but if we died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him ;
knowing that Christ , being raised from the dead , dies no more . death no more has dominion over him !
for the death that he died , he died to sin one time ; but the life that he lives , he lives to God .
thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin , but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord .
therefore don 't let sin reign in your mortal body , that you should obey it in its lusts .
neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness , but present yourselves to God , as alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness to God .
for sin will not have dominion over you . for you are not under law , but under grace .
what then ? shall we sin , because we are not under law , but under grace ? May it never be !
but thanks be to God , that , whereas you were bondservants of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered .
being made free from sin , you became bondservants of righteousness .
for when you were servants of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
but now , being made free from sin , and having become servants of God , you have your fruit of sanctification , and the result of eternal life .
for the wages of sin is death , but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
or don 't you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives ?
for the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives , but if the husband dies , she is discharged from the law of the husband .
for when we were in the flesh , the sinful passions which were through the law , worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death .
but sin , finding occasion through the commandment , produced in me all kinds of coveting . for apart from the law , sin is dead .
I was alive apart from the law once , but when the commandment came , sin revived , and I died .
for sin , finding occasion through the commandment , deceived me , and through it killed me .
therefore the law indeed is holy , and the commandment holy , and righteous , and good .
for we know that the law is spiritual , but I am fleshly , sold under sin .
for I don 't know what I am doing . for I don 't practice what I desire to do ; but what I hate , that I do .
but if what I don 't desire , that I do , I consent to the law that it is good .
so now it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwells in me .
for I know that in me , that is , in my flesh , dwells no good thing . for desire is present with me , but I don 't find it doing that which is good .
for the good which I desire , I don 't do ; but the evil which I don 't desire , that I practice .
but if what I don 't desire , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwells in me .
I find then the law , that , to me , while I desire to do good , evil is present .
for I delight in God 's law after the inward man ,
but I see a different law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members .
what a wretched man I am ! who will deliver me out of the body of this death ?
I thank God through Jesus Christ , our Lord ! so then with the mind , I myself serve God 's law , but with the flesh , the sin 's law .
there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus , who don 't walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
for the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death .
for what the law couldn 't do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God did , sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ;
that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit , the things of the Spirit .
for the mind of the flesh is death , but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace ;
because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God ; for it is not subject to God 's law , neither indeed can it be .
those who are in the flesh can 't please God .
but you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you . but if any man doesn 't have the Spirit of Christ , he is not his .
if Christ is in you , the body is dead because of sin , but the spirit is alive because of righteousness .
but if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you .
so then , brothers , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh .
for if you live after the flesh , you must die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
for as many as are led by the Spirit of God , these are children of God .
for you didn 't receive the spirit of bondage again to fear , but you received the Spirit of adoption , by whom we cry , " ABBA ! father ! "
the Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God ;
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint heirs with Christ ; if indeed we suffer with him , that we may also be glorified with him .
for I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us .
for the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed .
for we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now .
not only so , but ourselves also , who have the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for adoption , the redemption of our body .
for we were saved in hope , but hope that is seen is not hope . for who hopes for that which he sees ?
but if we hope for that which we don 't see , we wait for it with patience .
in the same way , the Spirit also helps our weaknesses , for we don 't know how to pray as we ought . but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can 't be uttered .
he who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit 's mind , because he makes intercession for the saints according to God .
we know that all things work together for good for those who love God , to those who are called according to his purpose .
for whom he foreknew , he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brothers .
whom he predestined , those he also called . whom he called , those he also justified . whom he justified , those he also glorified .
what then shall we say about these things ? if God is for us , who can be against us ?
he who didn 't spare his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how would he not also with him freely give us all things ?
who could bring a charge against God 's chosen ones ? it is God who justifies .
who is he who condemns ? it is Christ who died , yes rather , who was raised from the dead , who is at the right hand of God , who also makes intercession for us .
who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? could oppression , or anguish , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
even as it is written , " For your sake we are killed all day long . we were accounted as sheep for the slaughter . "
no , in all these things , we are more than conquerors through him who loved us .
I tell the truth in Christ . I am not lying , my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit ,
that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart .
of whom are the fathers , and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh , who is over all , God , blessed forever . Amen .
but it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing . for they are not all Israel , that are of Israel .
neither , because they are Abraham 's seed , are they all children . but , " In Isaac will your seed be called . "
that is , it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God , but the children of the promise are counted as a seed .
for this is a word of promise , " At the appointed time I will come , and Sarah will have a son . "
not only so , but Rebecca also conceived by one , by our father Isaac .
even as it is written , " Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . "
what shall we say then ? is there unrighteousness with God ? May it never be !
for he said to Moses , " I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . "
so then it is not of him who Wills , nor of him who runs , but of God who has mercy .
for the Scripture says to Pharaoh , " For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up , that I might show in you my power , and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth . "
so then , he has mercy on whom he desires , and he hardens whom he desires .
you will say then to me , " Why does he still find fault ? for who withstands his will ? "
but indeed , O man , who are you to reply against God ? will the thing formed ask him who formed it , " Why did you make me like this ? "
or hasn 't the Potter a right over the clay , from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor , and another for dishonor ?
what if God , willing to show his wrath , and to make his power known , endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction ,
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy , which he prepared beforehand for glory ,
US , whom he also called , not from the Jews only , but also from the Gentiles ?
as he says also in Hosea , " I will call them ' my people , ' which were not my people ; and her ' beloved , ' who was not beloved . "
" it will be that in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' There they will be called ' children of the living God . ' "
Isaiah cries concerning Israel , " If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea , it is the remnant who will be saved ;
for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness , because the Lord will make a short work upon the earth . "
as Isaiah has said before , " Unless the Lord of Armies had left us a seed , we would have become like Sodom , and would have been made like Gomorrah . "
what shall we say then ? that the Gentiles , who didn 't follow after righteousness , attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith ;
but Israel , following after a law of righteousness , didn 't arrive at the law of righteousness .
why ? because they didn 't seek it by faith , but as it were by works of the law . they stumbled over the stumbling stone ;
even as it is written , " behold , I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense ; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed . "
brothers , my heart 's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel , that they may be saved .
for I testify about them that they have a zeal for God , but not according to knowledge .
for being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and seeking to establish their own righteousness , they didn 't subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
for Christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes .
for Moses writes about the righteousness of the law , " The one who does them will live by them . "
but what does it say ? " the word is near you , in your mouth , and in your heart " ; that is , the word of faith , which we preach :
that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
for with the heart , one believes unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
for the Scripture says , " Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed . "
for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
for , " Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved . "
how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? how will they believe in him whom they have not heard ? how will they hear without a preacher ?
and how will they preach unless they are sent ? as it is written : " how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace , who bring glad tidings of good things ! "
but they didn 't all listen to the glad news . for Isaiah says , " Lord , who has believed our report ? "
so faith comes by hearing , and hearing by the word of God .
but I say , didn 't they hear ? yes , most certainly , " Their sound went out into all the earth , their words to the ends of the world . "
but I ask , didn 't Israel know ? first Moses says , " I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation , with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry . "
Isaiah is very bold , and says , " I was found by those who didn 't seek me . I was revealed to those who didn 't ask for me . "
but as to Israel he says , " All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people . "
I ask then , did God reject his people ? May it never be ! for I also am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
God didn 't reject his people , which he foreknew . or don 't you know what the Scripture says about Elijah ? how he pleads with God against Israel :
" Lord , they have killed your prophets , they have broken down your altars ; and I am left alone , and they seek my life . "
but how does God answer him ? " I have reserved for myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to Baal . "
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
what then ? that which Israel seeks for , that he didn 't obtain , but the chosen ones obtained it , and the rest were hardened .
according as it is written , " God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear , to this very day . "
David says , " Let their table be made a snare , and a trap , a stumbling block , and a retribution to them .
let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see . bow down their back always . "
I ask then , did they stumble that they might fall ? May it never be ! but by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles , to provoke them to jealousy .
now if their fall is the riches of the world , and their loss the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fullness ?
for I speak to you who are Gentiles . since then as I am an Apostle to Gentiles , I glorify my ministry ;
if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh , and may save some of them .
for if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world , what would their acceptance be , but life from the dead ?
if the first fruit is holy , so is the lump . if the root is holy , so are the branches .
you will say then , " branches were broken off , that I might be grafted in . "
true ; by their unbelief they were broken off , and you stand by your faith . Don 't be conceited , but fear ;
for if God didn 't spare the natural branches , neither will he spare you .
see then the Goodness and severity of God . toward those who fell , severity ; but toward you , Goodness , if you continue in his Goodness ; otherwise you also will be cut off .
they also , if they don 't continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
for if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree , and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree , how much more will these , which are the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
and so all Israel will be saved . even as it is written , " There will come out of Zion the Deliverer , and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob .
this is my Covenant to them , when I will take away their sins . "
concerning the Good News , they are enemies for your sake . but concerning the election , they are beloved for the fathers ' sake .
for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable .
for as you in time past were disobedient to God , but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience ,
even so these also have now been disobedient , that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy .
for God has shut up all to disobedience , that he might have mercy on all .
Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past tracing out !
" for who has known the mind of the Lord ? or who has been his counselor ? "
" or who has first given to him , and it will be repaid to him again ? "
therefore I urge you , brothers , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable to God , which is your spiritual service .
Don 't be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you may prove what is the good , well @-@ pleasing , and perfect will of God .
for even as we have many members in one body , and all the members don 't have the same function ,
having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us , if prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith ;
or service , let us give ourselves to service ; or he who teaches , to his teaching ;
or he who exhorts , to his exhorting : he who gives , let him do it with liberality ; he who rules , with diligence ; he who shows mercy , with cheerfulness .
let love be without hypocrisy . Abhor that which is evil . cling to that which is good .
in love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another ; in honor preferring one another ;
not lagging in diligence ; fervent in spirit ; serving the Lord ;
rejoicing in hope ; enduring in troubles ; continuing steadfastly in prayer ;
contributing to the needs of the saints ; given to hospitality .
bless those who persecute you ; bless , and don 't curse .
rejoice with those who rejoice . Weep with those who weep .
be of the same mind one toward another . Don 't set your mind on high things , but associate with the humble . Don 't be wise in your own conceits .
repay no one evil for evil . respect what is honorable in the sight of all men .
if it is possible , as much as it is up to you , be at peace with all men .
Don 't seek revenge yourselves , beloved , but give place to God 's wrath . for it is written , " vengeance belongs to me ; I will repay , says the Lord . "
therefore " If your enemy is hungry , feed him . if he is thirsty , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will heap coals of fire on his head . "
Don 't be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities , for there is no authority except from God , and those who exist are ordained by God .
therefore he who resists the authority , withstands the ordinance of God ; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment .
for rulers are not a terror to the good work , but to the evil . do you desire to have no fear of the authority ? do that which is good , and you will have praise from the same ,
therefore you need to be in subjection , not only because of the wrath , but also for conscience ' sake .
for this reason you also pay taxes , for they are servants of God 's service , attending continually on this very thing .
give therefore to everyone what you owe : taxes to whom taxes are due ; customs to whom customs ; respect to whom respect ; honor to whom honor .
owe no one anything , except to love one another ; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law .
love doesn 't harm a neighbor . love therefore is the fulfillment of the law .
do this , knowing the time , that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep , for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed .
the night is far gone , and the day is near . let 's therefore throw off the works of darkness , and let 's put on the armor of light .
let us walk properly , as in the day ; not in reveling and drunkenness , not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts , and not in strife and jealousy .
but put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh , for its lusts .
now accept one who is weak in faith , but not for disputes over opinions .
one man has faith to eat all things , but he who is weak eats only vegetables .
Don 't let him who eats despise him who doesn 't eat . Don 't let him who doesn 't eat judge him who eats , for God has accepted him .
one man esteems one day as more important . another esteems every day alike . let each man be fully assured in his own mind .
he who observes the day , observes it to the Lord ; and he who does not observe the day , to the Lord he does not observe it . he who eats , eats to the Lord , for he gives God thanks . he who doesn 't eat , to the Lord he doesn 't eat , and gives God thanks .
for none of us lives to himself , and none dies to himself .
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
for to this end Christ died , rose , and lived again , that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
but you , why do you judge your brother ? or you again , why do you despise your brother ? for we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
for it is written , " ' As I live , ' says the Lord , ' to me every knee will bow . every tongue will confess to God . ' "
so then each one of us will give account of himself to God .
therefore let 's not judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block in his brother 's way , or an occasion for falling .
I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean of itself ; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
yet if because of food your brother is grieved , you walk no longer in love . Don 't destroy with your food him for whom Christ died .
then don 't let your good be slandered ,
for the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness , peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit .
for he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men .
so then , let us follow after things which make for peace , and things by which we may build one another up .
Don 't overthrow God 's work for food 's sake . all things indeed are clean , however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating .
it is good to not eat meat , drink wine , nor do anything by which your brother stumbles , is offended , or is made weak .
do you have faith ? have it to yourself before God . happy is he who doesn 't judge himself in that which he approves .
now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good , to be building him up .
for even Christ didn 't please himself . but , as it is written , " The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me . "
for whatever things were written before were written for our learning , that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope .
now the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus ,
that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
therefore accept one another , even as Christ also accepted you , to the glory of God .
again , Isaiah says , " There will be the root of Jesse , he who arises to rule over the Gentiles ; in him the Gentiles will hope . "
now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that you may abound in hope , in the power of the Holy Spirit .
I myself am also persuaded about you , my brothers , that you yourselves are full of Goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish others .
but I write the more boldly to you in part , as reminding you , because of the grace that was given to me by God ,
I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God .
yes , making it my aim to preach the Good News , not where Christ was already named , that I might not build on another 's foundation .
but , as it is written , " They will see , to whom no news of him came . they who haven 't heard will understand . "
therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you ,
but now , I say , I am going to Jerusalem , serving the saints .
for it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem .
yes , it has been their good pleasure , and they are their debtors . for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things .
when therefore I have accomplished this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will go on by way of you to Spain .
I know that , when I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ .
now I beg you , brothers , by our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the love of the Spirit , that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea , and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ;
that I may come to you in joy through the will of God , and together with you , find rest .
now the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
I commend to you Phoebe , our sister , who is a servant of the assembly that is at Cenchreae ,
that you receive her in the Lord , in a way worthy of the saints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she herself also has been a helper of many , and of my own self .
greet Prisca and Aquila , my fellow workers in Christ Jesus ,
who for my life , laid down their own necks ; to whom not only I give thanks , but also all the assemblies of the Gentiles .
greet the assembly that is in their house . greet Epaenetus , my beloved , who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ .
greet Mary , who labored much for us .
greet Andronicus and Junia , my relatives and my fellow prisoners , who are notable among the Apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
greet Amplias , my beloved in the Lord .
greet Urbanus , our fellow worker in Christ , and Stachys , my beloved .
greet Apelles , the approved in Christ . greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus .
greet Herodion , my kinsman . greet them of the household of Narcissus , who are in the Lord .
greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who labor in the Lord . greet Persis , the beloved , who labored much in the Lord .
greet Rufus , the chosen in the Lord , and his mother and mine .
greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brothers who are with them .
greet Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
greet one another with a holy kiss . the assemblies of Christ greet you .
now I beg you , brothers , look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling , contrary to the doctrine which you learned , and turn away from them .
for those who are such don 't serve our Lord , Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by their smooth and flattering speech , they deceive the hearts of the innocent .
for your obedience has become known to all . I rejoice therefore over you . but I desire to have you wise in that which is good , but innocent in that which is evil .
and the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet . the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
Timothy , my fellow worker , greets you , as do Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater , my relatives .
I , Tertius , who write the letter , greet you in the Lord .
Gaius , my host and host of the whole assembly , greets you . Erastus , the treasurer of the city , greets you , as does Quartus , the brother .
I always thank my God concerning you , for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus ;
that in everything you were enriched in him , in all speech and all knowledge ;
so that you come behind in no gift ; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
who will also confirm you until the end , blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ , our Lord .
now I beg you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Chloe 's household , that there are contentions among you .
now I mean this , that each one of you says , " I follow Paul , " " I follow Apollos , " " I follow Cephas , " and , " I follow Christ . "
is Christ divided ? was Paul crucified for you ? or were you baptized into the name of Paul ?
I thank God that I baptized none of you , except Crispus and Gaius ,
( I also baptized the household of Stephanas ; besides them , I don 't know whether I baptized any other . )
for Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the Good News--not in wisdom of words , so that the cross of Christ wouldn 't be made void .
for the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying , but to us who are saved it is the power of God .
for it is written , " I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing . "
where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the lawyer of this world ? Hasn 't God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
for seeing that in the wisdom of God , the world through its wisdom didn 't know God , it was God 's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe .
but we preach Christ crucified ; a stumbling block to Jews , and foolishness to Greeks ,
but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
because the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
for you see your calling , brothers , that not many are wise according to the flesh , not many mighty , and not many noble ;
but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to shame the things that are strong ;
and God chose the lowly things of the world , and the things that are despised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
that no flesh should boast before God .
but of him , you are in Christ Jesus , who was made to us wisdom from God , and righteousness and sanctification , and redemption :
when I came to you , brothers , I didn 't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom , proclaiming to you the testimony of God .
for I determined not to know anything among you , except Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
I was with you in weakness , in fear , and in much trembling .
my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
that your faith wouldn 't stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
we speak wisdom , however , among those who are full grown ; yet a wisdom not of this world , nor of the rulers of this world , who are coming to nothing .
but as it is written , " Things which an eye didn 't see , and an ear didn 't hear , which didn 't enter into the heart of man , these God has prepared for those who love him . "
but to us , God revealed them through the Spirit . for the Spirit searches all things , yes , the deep things of God .
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spirit .
but we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
which things also we speak , not in words which man 's wisdom teaches , but which the Holy Spirit teaches , comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .
now the natural man doesn 't receive the things of God 's Spirit , for they are foolishness to him , and he can 't know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
but he who is spiritual discerns all things , and he himself is judged by no one .
" for who has known the mind of the Lord , that he should instruct him ? " but we have Christ 's mind .
brothers , I couldn 't speak to you as to spiritual , but as to fleshly , as to babies in Christ .
I fed you with milk , not with meat ; for you weren 't yet ready . indeed , not even now are you ready ,
for you are still fleshly . for insofar as there is jealousy , strife , and factions among you , aren 't you fleshly , and don 't you walk in the ways of men ?
for when one says , " I follow Paul , " and another , " I follow Apollos , " aren 't you fleshly ?
who then is Apollos , and who is Paul , but servants through whom you believed ; and each as the Lord gave to him ?
I planted . Apollos watered . but God gave the increase .
so then neither he who plants is anything , nor he who waters , but God who gives the increase .
now he who plants and he who waters are the same , but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
for we are God 's fellow workers . you are God 's farming , God 's building .
according to the grace of God which was given to me , as a wise master builder I laid a foundation , and another builds on it . but let each man be careful how he builds on it .
for no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid , which is Jesus Christ .
but if anyone builds on the foundation with gold , silver , costly stones , wood , hay , or stubble ;
each man 's work will be revealed . for the Day will declare it , because it is revealed in fire ; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man 's work is .
if any man 's work remains which he built on it , he will receive a reward .
if any man 's work is burned , he will suffer loss , but he himself will be saved , but as through fire .
Don 't you know that you are a temple of God , and that God 's Spirit lives in you ?
if anyone destroys the temple of God , God will destroy him ; for God 's temple is holy , which you are .
let no one deceive himself . if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world , let him become a fool , that he may become wise .
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . for it is written , " He has taken the wise in their craftiness . "
and again , " The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise , that it is worthless . "
therefore let no one boast in men . for all things are yours ,
whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come . all are yours ,
and you are Christ 's , and Christ is God 's .
so let a man think of us as Christ 's servants , and stewards of God 's mysteries .
here , moreover , it is required of stewards , that they be found faithful .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don 't judge my own self .
for I know nothing against myself . yet I am not justified by this , but he who judges me is the Lord .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you didn 't receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
you are already filled . you have already become rich . you have come to reign without us . yes , and I wish that you did reign , that we also might reign with you .
we are fools for Christ 's sake , but you are wise in Christ . we are weak , but you are strong . you have honor , but we have dishonor .
even to this present hour we hunger , thirst , are naked , are beaten , and have no certain dwelling place .
we toil , working with our own hands . when people curse us , we bless . being persecuted , we endure .
being defamed , we entreat . we are made as the Filth of the world , the dirt wiped off by all , even until now .
I don 't write these things to shame you , but to admonish you as my beloved children .
for though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ , yet not many fathers . for in Christ Jesus , I became your father through the Good News .
I beg you therefore , be imitators of me .
now some are puffed up , as though I were not coming to you .
but I will come to you shortly , if the Lord is willing . and I will know , not the word of those who are puffed up , but the power .
for the Kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .
what do you want ? shall I come to you with a rod , or in love and a spirit of gentleness ?
it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles , that one has his father 's wife .
you are puffed up , and didn 't rather mourn , that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you .
your boasting is not good . Don 't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump ?
purge out the old yeast , that you may be a new lump , even as you are unleavened . for indeed Christ , our Passover , has been sacrificed in our place .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old yeast , neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners ;
yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world , or with the covetous and extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then you would have to leave the world .
for what have I to do with also judging those who are outside ? Don 't you judge those who are within ?
but those who are outside , God judges . " put away the wicked man from among yourselves . "
dare any of you , having a matter against his neighbor , go to law before the unrighteous , and not before the saints ?
Don 't you know that the saints will judge the world ? and if the world is judged by you , are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
Don 't you know that we will judge angels ? how much more , things that pertain to this life ?
if then , you have to judge things pertaining to this life , do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly ?
I say this to move you to shame . Isn 't there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers ?
but brother goes to law with brother , and that before unbelievers !
therefore it is already altogether a defect in you , that you have lawsuits one with another . why not rather be wronged ? why not rather be defrauded ?
no , but you yourselves do wrong , and defraud , and that against your brothers .
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sanctified . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
" all things are lawful for me , " but not all things are expedient . " all things are lawful for me , " but I will not be brought under the power of anything .
now God raised up the Lord , and will also raise us up by his power .
Don 't you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them members of a prostitute ? May it never be !
or don 't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body ? for , " The two , " says he , " will become one flesh . "
but he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit .
flee sexual immorality ! " every sin that a man does is outside the body , " but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body .
or don 't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
for you were bought with a price . therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit , which are God 's .
now concerning the things about which you wrote to me : it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
but , because of sexual immoralities , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
the wife doesn 't have authority over her own body , but the husband . likewise also the husband doesn 't have authority over his own body , but the wife .
Don 't deprive one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer , and may be together again , that Satan doesn 't tempt you because of your lack of self @-@ control .
but this I say by way of concession , not of commandment .
yet I wish that all men were like me . however each man has his own gift from God , one of this kind , and another of that kind .
but I say to the unmarried and to widows , it is good for them if they remain even as I am .
but if they don 't have self @-@ control , let them marry . for it 's better to marry than to burn .
but to the married I command--not I , but the Lord--that the wife not leave her husband
( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
but to the rest I--not the Lord--say , if any brother has an unbelieving wife , and she is content to live with him , let him not leave her .
the woman who has an unbelieving husband , and he is content to live with her , let her not leave her husband .
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband . otherwise your children would be unclean , but now they are holy .
yet if the unbeliever departs , let there be separation . the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called us in peace .
for how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
only , as the Lord has distributed to each man , as God has called each , so let him walk . so I command in all the assemblies .
was anyone called having been circumcised ? let him not become uncircumcised . has anyone been called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
let each man stay in that calling in which he was called .
were you called being a bondservant ? Don 't let that bother you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it .
for he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord 's free man . likewise he who was called being free is Christ 's bondservant .
you were bought with a price . Don 't become bondservants of men .
brothers , let each man , in whatever condition he was called , stay in that condition with God .
now concerning virgins , I have no commandment from the Lord , but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy .
I think that it is good therefore , because of the distress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
are you bound to a wife ? Don 't seek to be freed . are you free from a wife ? Don 't seek a wife .
but I desire to have you to be free from cares . he who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world , how he may please his wife .
this I say for your own profit ; not that I may ensnare you , but for that which is appropriate , and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction .
but he who stands steadfast in his heart , having no necessity , but has power over his own heart , to keep his own virgin , does well .
so then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well , and he who doesn 't give her in marriage does better .
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to whomever she desires , only in the Lord .
but she is happier if she stays as she is , in my judgment , and I think that I also have God 's Spirit .
now concerning things sacrificed to idols : we know that we all have knowledge . knowledge puffs up , but love builds up .
but if anyone thinks that he knows anything , he doesn 't yet know as he ought to know .
but if anyone loves God , the same is known by him .
therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols , we know that no idol is anything in the world , and that there is no other God but one .
but food will not commend us to God . for neither , if we don 't eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
but be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak .
for if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol 's temple , won 't his conscience , if he is weak , be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols ?
and through your knowledge , he who is weak perishes , the brother for whose sake Christ died .
thus , sinning against the brothers , and wounding their conscience when it is weak , you sin against Christ .
therefore if food causes my brother to stumble , I will eat no meat forevermore , that I don 't cause my brother to stumble .
am I not free ? am I not an Apostle ? haven 't I seen Jesus Christ , our Lord ? Aren 't you my work in the Lord ?
if to others I am not an Apostle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
my defense to those who examine me is this .
have we no right to eat and to drink ?
have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer , even as the rest of the Apostles , and the brothers of the Lord , and Cephas ?
or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work ?
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a vineyard , and doesn 't eat of its fruit ? or who feeds a flock , and doesn 't drink from the flock 's milk ?
do I speak these things according to the ways of men ? or doesn 't the law also say the same thing ?
if we sowed to you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things ?
Don 't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple , and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar ?
even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News .
but I have used none of these things , and I don 't write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my boasting void .
for if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . but if not of my own will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me .
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
for though I was free from all , I brought myself under bondage to all , that I might gain the more .
to the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain Jews ; to those who are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain those who are under the law ;
to those who are without law , as without law ( not being without law toward God , but under law toward Christ ) , that I might win those who are without law .
to the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
now I do this for the sake of the Good News , that I may be a joint partaker of it .
Don 't you know that those who run in a race all run , but one receives the prize ? run like that , that you may win .
every man who strives in the games exercises self @-@ control in all things . now they do it to receive a corruptible crown , but we an incorruptible .
I therefore run like that , as not uncertainly . I fight like that , as not beating the air ,
but I beat my body and bring it into submission , lest by any means , after I have preached to others , I myself should be rejected .
now I would not have you ignorant , brothers , that our fathers were all under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
and all ate the same spiritual food ;
and all drank the same spiritual drink . for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ .
however with most of them , God was not well pleased , for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted .
neither be idolaters , as some of them were . as it is written , " The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play . "
neither let us commit sexual immorality , as some of them committed , and in one day twenty @-@ three thousand fell .
neither let us test the Lord , as some of them tested , and perished by the Serpents .
neither grumble , as some of them also grumbled , and perished by the destroyer .
now all these things happened to them by way of example , and they were written for our admonition , on whom the ends of the ages have come .
therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn 't fall .
therefore , my beloved , flee from idolatry .
I speak as to wise men . judge what I say .
the cup of blessing which we bless , isn 't it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , isn 't it a sharing of the body of Christ ?
because there is one loaf of bread , we , who are many , are one body ; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread .
consider Israel according to the flesh . Don 't those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar ?
what am I saying then ? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to demons , and not to God , and I don 't desire that you would have fellowship with demons .
you can 't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . you can 't both partake of the table of the Lord , and of the table of demons .
or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? are we stronger than he ?
" all things are lawful for me , " but not all things are profitable . " all things are lawful for me , " but not all things build up .
let no one seek his own , but each one his neighbor 's good .
whatever is sold in the butcher shop , eat , asking no question for the sake of conscience ,
for " the earth is the Lord 's , and its fullness . "
but if one of those who don 't believe invites you to a meal , and you are inclined to go , eat whatever is set before you , asking no questions for the sake of conscience .
but if anyone says to you , " This was offered to idols , " don 't eat it for the sake of the one who told you , and for the sake of conscience . for " the earth is the Lord 's , and all its fullness . "
conscience , I say , not your own , but the other 's conscience . for why is my liberty judged by another conscience ?
if I partake with thankfulness , why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks ?
whether therefore you eat , or drink , or whatever you do , do all to the glory of God .
give no occasions for stumbling , either to Jews , or to Greeks , or to the assembly of God ;
even as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be saved .
be imitators of me , even as I also am of Christ .
now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
every man praying or prophesying , having his head covered , dishonors his head .
but every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head . for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved .
for if a woman is not covered , let her also be shorn . but if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
for man is not from woman , but woman from man ;
for neither was man created for the woman , but woman for the man .
for this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head , because of the angels .
nevertheless , neither is the woman independent of the man , nor the man independent of the woman , in the Lord .
for as woman came from man , so a man also comes through a woman ; but all things are from God .
judge for yourselves . is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled ?
but if any man seems to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither do God 's assemblies .
but in giving you this command , I don 't praise you , that you come together not for the better but for the worse .
for first of all , when you come together in the assembly , I hear that divisions exist among you , and I partly believe it .
for there also must be factions among you , that those who are approved may be revealed among you .
when therefore you assemble yourselves together , it is not the Lord 's Supper that you eat .
for in your eating each one takes his own Supper first . one is hungry , and another is drunken .
in the same way he also took the cup , after Supper , saying , " This cup is the new Covenant in my blood . do this , as often as you drink , in memory of me . "
for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord 's death until he comes .
therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord 's cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of the bread , and drink of the cup .
for he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he doesn 't discern the Lord 's body .
for this cause many among you are weak and sickly , and not a few sleep .
for if we discerned ourselves , we wouldn 't be judged .
but when we are judged , we are punished by the Lord , that we may not be condemned with the world .
therefore , my brothers , when you come together to eat , wait for one another .
but if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest your coming together be for judgment . the rest I will set in order whenever I come .
now concerning spiritual things , brothers , I don 't want you to be ignorant .
you know that when you were heathen , you were led away to those mute idols , however you might be led .
now there are various kinds of gifts , but the same Spirit .
there are various kinds of service , and the same Lord .
there are various kinds of workings , but the same God , who works all things in all .
but to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all .
but the one and the same Spirit works all of these , distributing to each one separately as he desires .
for as the body is one , and has many members , and all the members of the body , being many , are one body ; so also is Christ .
for the body is not one member , but many .
if the foot would say , " Because I 'm not the hand , I 'm not part of the body , " it is not therefore not part of the body .
if the ear would say , " Because I 'm not the eye , I 'm not part of the body , " it 's not therefore not part of the body .
if the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? if the whole were hearing , where would the smelling be ?
but now God has set the members , each one of them , in the body , just as he desired .
if they were all one member , where would the body be ?
but now they are many members , but one body .
the eye can 't tell the hand , " I have no need for you , " or again the head to the feet , " I have no need for you . "
no , much rather , those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary .
those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable , on those we bestow more abundant honor ; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety ;
whereas our presentable parts have no such need . but God composed the body together , giving more abundant honor to the inferior part ,
that there should be no division in the body , but that the members should have the same care for one another .
when one member suffers , all the members suffer with it . or when one member is honored , all the members rejoice with it .
now you are the body of Christ , and members individually .
are all Apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? are all miracle workers ?
do all have gifts of healings ? do all speak with various languages ? do all interpret ?
but earnestly desire the best gifts . moreover , I show a most excellent way to you .
if I speak with the languages of men and of angels , but don 't have love , I have become sounding brass , or a clanging cymbal .
if I have the gift of prophecy , and know all mysteries and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but don 't have love , I am nothing .
if I dole out all my goods to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but don 't have love , it profits me nothing .
love is patient and is kind ; love doesn 't envy . love doesn 't brag , is not proud ,
doesn 't behave itself inappropriately , doesn 't seek its own way , is not provoked , takes no account of evil ;
doesn 't rejoice in unrighteousness , but rejoices with the truth ;
bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
love never fails . but where there are prophecies , they will be done away with . where there are various languages , they will cease . where there is knowledge , it will be done away with .
for we know in part , and we prophesy in part ;
but when that which is complete has come , then that which is partial will be done away with .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away childish things .
for now we see in a mirror , dimly , but then face to face . now I know in part , but then I will know fully , even as I was also fully known .
but now faith , hope , and love remain--these three . the greatest of these is love .
follow after love , and earnestly desire spiritual gifts , but especially that you may prophesy .
for he who speaks in another language speaks not to men , but to God ; for no one understands ; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries .
but he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification , exhortation , and consolation .
he who speaks in another language edifies himself , but he who prophesies edifies the assembly .
now I desire to have you all speak with other languages , but rather that you would prophesy . for he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages , unless he interprets , that the assembly may be built up .
but now , brothers , if I come to you speaking with other languages , what would I profit you , unless I speak to you either by way of revelation , or of knowledge , or of prophesying , or of teaching ?
even things without life , giving a voice , whether pipe or harp , if they didn 't give a distinction in the sounds , how would it be known what is piped or harped ?
for if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound , who would prepare himself for war ?
so also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of sounds in the world , and none of them is without meaning .
if then I don 't know the meaning of the sound , I would be to him who speaks a foreigner , and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me .
so also you , since you are zealous for spiritual gifts , seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly .
therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret .
for if I pray in another language , my spirit prays , but my understanding is unfruitful .
what is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
otherwise if you bless with the spirit , how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the " Amen " at your giving of thanks , seeing he doesn 't know what you say ?
for you most certainly give thanks well , but the other person is not built up .
I thank my God , I speak with other languages more than you all .
however in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in another language .
brothers , don 't be children in thoughts , yet in malice be babies , but in thoughts be mature .
in the law it is written , " By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people . not even thus will they hear me , says the Lord . "
therefore other languages are for a sign , not to those who believe , but to the unbelieving ; but prophesying is for a sign , not to the unbelieving , but to those who believe .
if therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages , and unlearned or unbelieving people come in , won 't they say that you are crazy ?
but if all prophesy , and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in , he is reproved by all , and he is judged by all .
and thus the secrets of his heart are revealed . so he will fall down on his face and worship God , declaring that God is among you indeed .
if any man speaks in another language , let it be two , or at the most three , and in turn ; and let one interpret .
but if there is no interpreter , let him keep silent in the assembly , and let him speak to himself , and to God .
let the prophets speak , two or three , and let the others discern .
but if a revelation is made to another sitting by , let the first keep silent .
for you all can prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be exhorted .
the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets ,
for God is not a God of confusion , but of peace . as in all the assemblies of the saints ,
let your wives keep silent in the assemblies , for it has not been permitted for them to speak ; but let them be in subjection , as the law also says .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly .
what ? was it from you that the word of God went out ? or did it come to you alone ?
if any man thinks himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him recognize the things which I write to you , that they are the commandment of the Lord .
but if anyone is ignorant , let him be ignorant .
therefore , brothers , desire earnestly to prophesy , and don 't forbid speaking with other languages .
now I declare to you , brothers , the Good News which I preached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand ,
by which also you are saved , if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you--unless you believed in vain .
for I delivered to you first of all that which I also received : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures ,
then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once , most of whom remain until now , but some have also fallen asleep .
then he appeared to James , then to all the Apostles ,
for I am the least of the Apostles , who is not worthy to be called an Apostle , because I persecuted the assembly of God .
whether then it is I or they , so we preach , and so you believed .
now if Christ is preached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
but if there is no resurrection of the dead , neither has Christ been raised .
if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain , and your faith also is in vain .
yes , we are found false witnesses of God , because we testified about God that he raised up Christ , whom he didn 't raise up , if it is so that the dead are not raised .
for if the dead aren 't raised , neither has Christ been raised .
if Christ has not been raised , your faith is vain ; you are still in your sins .
then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
if we have only hoped in Christ in this life , we are of all men most pitiable .
but now Christ has been raised from the dead . he became the first fruits of those who are asleep .
for since death came by man , the resurrection of the dead also came by man .
for as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive .
but each in his own order : Christ the first fruits , then those who are Christ 's , at his coming .
then the end comes , when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power .
for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet .
the last enemy that will be abolished is death .
when all things have been subjected to him , then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him , that God may be all in all .
or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead ? if the dead aren 't raised at all , why then are they baptized for the dead ?
why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour ?
I affirm , by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily .
if I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes , what does it profit me ? if the dead are not raised , then " let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . "
Don 't be deceived ! " evil companionships corrupt good morals . "
wake up righteously , and don 't sin , for some have no knowledge of God . I say this to your shame .
but someone will say , " How are the dead raised ? " and , " With what kind of body do they come ? "
you foolish one , that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies .
that which you sow , you don 't sow the body that will be , but a bare grain , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind .
but God gives it a body even as it pleased him , and to each seed a body of its own .
all flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of men , another flesh of animals , another of fish , and another of birds .
there are also celestial bodies , and terrestrial bodies ; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial .
there is one glory of the sun , another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differs from another star in glory .
so also is the resurrection of the dead . it is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption .
it is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .
it is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . there is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body .
so also it is written , " The first man , Adam , became a living soul . " the last Adam became a life @-@ giving spirit .
however that which is spiritual isn 't first , but that which is natural , then that which is spiritual .
the first man is of the earth , made of dust . the second man is the Lord from heaven .
as is the one made of dust , such are those who are also made of dust ; and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
as we have borne the image of those made of dust , let 's also bear the image of the heavenly .
now I say this , brothers , that flesh and blood can 't inherit the Kingdom of God ; neither does corruption inherit incorruption .
for this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality .
but when this corruptible will have put on incorruption , and this mortal will have put on immortality , then what is written will happen : " death is swallowed up in victory . "
" death , where is your sting ? Hades , where is your victory ? "
the sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
but thanks be to God , who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
therefore , my beloved brothers , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the Lord 's work , because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .
now concerning the collection for the saints , as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia , you do likewise .
on the first day of the week , let each one of you save , as he may prosper , that no collections be made when I come .
when I arrive , I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem .
if it is appropriate for me to go also , they will go with me .
but I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia , for I am passing through Macedonia .
but with you it may be that I will stay , or even winter , that you may send me on my journey wherever I go .
for I do not wish to see you now in passing , but I hope to stay a while with you , if the Lord permits .
but I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost ,
for a great and effective door has opened to me , and there are many adversaries .
now if Timothy comes , see that he is with you without fear , for he does the work of the Lord , as I also do .
therefore let no one despise him . but set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
now concerning Apollos , the brother , I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers ; and it was not at all his desire to come now ; but he will come when he has an opportunity .
watch ! stand firm in the faith ! be courageous ! be strong !
let all that you do be done in love .
I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus ; for that which was lacking on your part , they supplied .
for they refreshed my spirit and yours . therefore acknowledge those who are like that .
the assemblies of Asia greet you . Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord , together with the assembly that is in their house .
all the brothers greet you . greet one another with a holy kiss .
this greeting is by me , Paul , with my own hand .
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
my love to all of you in Christ Jesus . Amen .
Paul , an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia :
grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and God of all comfort ;
who comforts us in all our affliction , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
for as the sufferings of Christ abound to us , even so our comfort also abounds through Christ .
but if we are afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation . if we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer .
our hope for you is steadfast , knowing that , since you are partakers of the sufferings , so also are you of the comfort .
yes , we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead ,
for our boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in holiness and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you .
in this confidence , I was determined to come first to you , that you might have a second benefit ;
but as God is faithful , our word toward you was not " Yes and no . "
for the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us , by me , Silvanus , and Timothy , was not " Yes and no , " but in him is " Yes . "
for however many are the promises of God , in him is the " Yes . " therefore also through him is the " Amen , " to the glory of God through us .
now he who establishes us with you in Christ , and anointed us , is God ;
who also sealed us , and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts .
but I call God for a witness to my soul , that I didn 't come to Corinth to spare you .
not that we have lordship over your faith , but are fellow workers with you for your joy . for you stand firm in faith .
but I determined this for myself , that I would not come to you again in sorrow .
for if I make you sorry , then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me ?
and I wrote this very thing to you , so that , when I came , I wouldn 't have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy would be shared by all of you .
for out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears , not that you should be made sorry , but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you .
but if any has caused sorrow , he has caused sorrow , not to me , but in part ( that I not press too heavily ) to you all .
sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many ;
so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him , lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow .
therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him .
for to this end I also wrote , that I might know the proof of you , whether you are obedient in all things .
now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything . for if indeed I have forgiven anything , I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ ,
that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan ; for we are not ignorant of his schemes .
now thanks be to God , who always leads us in triumph in Christ , and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place .
for we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God , in those who are saved , and in those who perish ;
to the one a stench from death to death ; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life . who is sufficient for these things ?
are we beginning again to commend ourselves ? or do we need , as do some , letters of commendation to you or from you ?
you are our letter , written in our hearts , known and read by all men ;
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
such confidence we have through Christ toward God ;
not that we are sufficient of ourselves , to account anything as from ourselves ; but our sufficiency is from God ;
who also made us sufficient as servants of a new Covenant ; not of the letter , but of the Spirit . for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
for if the service of condemnation has glory , the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory .
for most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect , by reason of the glory that surpasses .
for if that which passes away was with glory , much more that which remains is in glory .
having therefore such a hope , we use great boldness of speech ,
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel wouldn 't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away .
but their minds were hardened , for until this very day at the reading of the old Covenant the same veil remains , because in Christ it passes away .
but to this day , when Moses is read , a veil lies on their heart .
but whenever one turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
therefore seeing we have this ministry , even as we obtained mercy , we don 't faint .
but we have renounced the hidden things of shame , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
even if our Good News is veiled , it is veiled in those who perish ;
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
for we don 't preach ourselves , but Christ Jesus as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for Jesus ' sake ;
but we have this treasure in clay vessels , that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God , and not from ourselves .
we are pressed on every side , yet not crushed ; perplexed , yet not to despair ;
pursued , yet not forsaken ; struck down , yet not destroyed ;
always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus , that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body .
for we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh .
so then death works in us , but life in you .
but having the same spirit of faith , according to that which is written , " I believed , and therefore I spoke . " we also believe , and therefore also we speak ;
knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus , and will present us with you .
for all things are for your sakes , that the grace , being multiplied through the many , may cause the Thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God .
therefore we don 't faint , but though our outward man is decaying , yet our inward man is renewed day by day .
for our light affliction , which is for the moment , works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory ;
while we don 't look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal .
for we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal , in the heavens .
for most certainly in this we groan , longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven ;
if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked .
for indeed we who are in this tent do groan , being burdened ; not that we desire to be unclothed , but that we desire to be clothed , that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
now he who made us for this very thing is God , who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit .
therefore we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord ;
for we walk by faith , not by sight .
we are courageous , I say , and are willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be at home with the Lord .
therefore also we make it our aim , whether at home or absent , to be well pleasing to him .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
knowing therefore the fear of the Lord , we persuade men , but we are revealed to God ; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences .
for we are not commending ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance , and not in heart .
for if we are beside ourselves , it is for God . or if we are of sober mind , it is for you .
for the love of Christ constrains us ; because we judge thus , that one died for all , therefore all died .
he died for all , that those who live should no longer live to themselves , but to him who for their sakes died and rose again .
therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on . even though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now we know him so no more .
therefore if anyone is in Christ , he is a new creation . the old things have passed away . behold , all things have become new .
but all things are of God , who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ , and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
namely , that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself , not reckoning to them their trespasses , and having committed to us the word of reconciliation .
we are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ , as though God were entreating by us : we beg you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God .
for him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf ; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God .
working together , we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain ,
for he says , " At an acceptable time I listened to you , in a day of salvation I helped you . " behold , now is the acceptable time . behold , now is the day of salvation .
we give no occasion of stumbling in anything , that our service may not be blamed ,
as unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and behold , we live ; as punished , and not killed ;
as sorrowful , yet always rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , and yet possessing all things .
our mouth is open to you , Corinthians . our heart is enlarged .
now in return , I speak as to my children , you also be open wide .
Don 't be unequally yoked with unbelievers , for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity ? or what fellowship has light with darkness ?
what agreement has Christ with Belial ? or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever ?
therefore " ' Come out from among them , and be separate , ' says the Lord . ' touch no unclean thing . I will receive you .
I will be to you a Father . you will be to me sons and daughters , ' says the Lord Almighty . "
having therefore these promises , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God .
open your hearts to us . we wronged no one . we corrupted no one . we took advantage of no one .
I say this not to condemn you , for I have said before , that you are in our hearts to die together and live together .
great is my boldness of speech toward you . great is my boasting on your behalf . I am filled with comfort . I overflow with joy in all our affliction .
for even when we had come into Macedonia , our flesh had no relief , but we were afflicted on every side . Fightings were outside . fear was inside .
for godly sorrow works repentance to salvation , which brings no regret . but the sorrow of the world works death .
so although I wrote to you , I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered the wrong , but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God .
therefore we have been comforted . in our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by you all .
for if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf , I was not disappointed . but as we spoke all things to you in truth , so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth .
his affection is more abundantly toward you , while he remembers all of your obedience , how with fear and trembling you received him .
I rejoice that in everything I am confident concerning you .
for according to their power , I testify , yes and beyond their power , they gave of their own accord ,
begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints .
this was not as we had hoped , but first they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us through the will of God .
so we urged Titus , that as he made a beginning before , so he would also complete in you this grace .
but as you abound in everything , in faith , utterance , knowledge , all earnestness , and in your love to us , see that you also abound in this grace .
I speak not by way of commandment , but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love .
for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
I give a judgment in this : for this is expedient for you , who were the first to start a year ago , not only to do , but also to be willing .
but now complete the doing also , that as there was the readiness to be willing , so there may be the completion also out of your ability .
for if the readiness is there , it is acceptable according to what you have , not according to what you don 't have .
but thanks be to God , who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus .
for he indeed accepted our exhortation , but being himself very earnest , he went out to you of his own accord .
we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies .
we are avoiding this , that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us .
having regard for honorable things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
we have sent with them our brother , whom we have many times proved earnest in many things , but now much more earnest , by reason of the great confidence which he has in you .
as for Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker for you . as for our brothers , they are the Apostles of the assemblies , the glory of Christ .
therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies , and of our boasting on your behalf .
it is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints ,
but I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect , that , just as I said , you may be prepared ,
so that I won 't by any means , if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared , we ( to say nothing of you ) should be disappointed in this confident boasting .
remember this : he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly . he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully .
let each man give according as he has determined in his heart ; not grudgingly , or under compulsion ; for God loves a cheerful giver .
and God is able to make all grace abound to you , that you , always having all sufficiency in everything , may abound to every good work .
as it is written , " He has scattered abroad , he has given to the poor . his righteousness remains forever . "
now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food , supply and multiply your seed for sowing , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ;
you being enriched in everything to all liberality , which works through us Thanksgiving to God .
for this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints , but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God ;
seeing that through the proof given by this service , they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ , and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all ;
while they themselves also , with supplication on your behalf , yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you .
now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift !
for though we walk in the flesh , we don 't wage war according to the flesh ;
for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh , but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds ,
throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God , and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ ;
and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience , when your obedience will be made full .
do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face ? if anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ 's , let him consider this again with himself , that , even as he is Christ 's , so also we are Christ 's .
for though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be disappointed ,
that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters .
for , " His letters , " they say , " are weighty and strong , but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech is despised . "
let such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when we are absent , such are we also in deed when we are present .
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
but we will not boast beyond proper limits , but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us , which reach even to you .
for we don 't stretch ourselves too much , as though we didn 't reach to you . for we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ ,
not boasting beyond proper limits in other men 's labors , but having hope that as your faith grows , we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence ,
so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you , not to boast in what someone else has already done .
for it isn 't he who commends himself who is approved , but whom the Lord commends .
I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness , but indeed you do bear with me .
for I am Jealous over you with a godly jealousy . for I married you to one husband , that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ .
but I am afraid that somehow , as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness , so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
for I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best Apostles .
but though I am unskilled in speech , yet I am not unskilled in knowledge . no , in every way we have been revealed to you in all things .
or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted , because I preached to you God 's Good News free of charge ?
I robbed other assemblies , taking wages from them that I might serve you .
as the truth of Christ is in me , no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
why ? because I don 't love you ? God knows .
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they boast , they may be found even as we .
for such men are false Apostles , deceitful workers , masquerading as Christ 's Apostles .
and no wonder , for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light .
it is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness , whose end will be according to their works .
I say again , let no one think me foolish . but if so , yet receive me as foolish , that I also may boast a little .
that which I speak , I don 't speak according to the Lord , but as in foolishness , in this confidence of boasting .
seeing that many boast after the flesh , I will also boast .
for you bear with the foolish gladly , being wise .
for you bear with a man , if he brings you into bondage , if he devours you , if he takes you captive , if he exalts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
I speak by way of disparagement , as though we had been weak . yet however any is bold ( I speak in foolishness ) , I am bold also .
are they Hebrews ? so am I. Are they Israelites ? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I.
five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one .
three times I was beaten with rods . once I was stoned . three times I suffered shipwreck . I have been a night and a day in the deep .
I have been in travels often , perils of rivers , perils of robbers , perils from my countrymen , perils from the Gentiles , perils in the city , perils in the wilderness , perils in the sea , perils among false brothers ;
in labor and travail , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , and in cold and nakedness .
besides those things that are outside , there is that which presses on me daily , anxiety for all the assemblies .
who is weak , and I am not weak ? who is caused to stumble , and I don 't burn with indignation ?
if I must boast , I will boast of the things that concern my weakness .
the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ , he who is blessed forevermore , knows that I don 't lie .
in Damascus the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of the Damascenes desiring to arrest me .
through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall , and escaped his hands .
it is doubtless not profitable for me to boast . for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
on behalf of such a one I will boast , but on my own behalf I will not boast , except in my weaknesses .
for if I would desire to boast , I will not be foolish ; for I will speak the truth . but I refrain , so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me , or hears from me .
by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations , that I should not be exalted excessively , there was given to me a Thorn in the flesh , a messenger of Satan to torment me , that I should not be exalted excessively .
concerning this thing , I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me .
he has said to me , " My grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness . " most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses , that the power of Christ may rest on me .
therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses , in injuries , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses , for Christ 's sake . for when I am weak , then am I strong .
truly the signs of an Apostle were worked among you in all patience , in signs and wonders and mighty works .
for what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this wrong .
I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls . if I love you more abundantly , am I loved the less ?
but be it so , I did not myself burden you . but , being crafty , I caught you with deception .
did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you ?
I exhorted Titus , and I sent the brother with him . did Titus take any advantage of you ? Didn 't we walk in the same spirit ? Didn 't we walk in the same steps ?
again , do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you ? in the sight of God we speak in Christ . but all things , beloved , are for your edifying .
this is the third time I am coming to you . " at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established . "
seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me ; who toward you is not weak , but is powerful in you .
for he was crucified through weakness , yet he lives through the power of God . for we also are weak in him , but we will live with him through the power of God toward you .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don 't you know as to your own selves , that Jesus Christ is in you ? --unless indeed you are disqualified .
but I hope that you will know that we aren 't disqualified .
now I pray to God that you do no evil ; not that we may appear approved , but that you may do that which is honorable , though we are as reprobate .
for we can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth .
for we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong . and this we also pray for , even your perfecting .
for this cause I write these things while absent , that I may not deal sharply when present , according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up , and not for tearing down .
greet one another with a holy kiss .
all the saints greet you .
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit , be with you all . Amen .
grace to you and peace from God the Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ ,
who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us out of this present evil age , according to the will of our God and Father--
to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different " good news " ;
and there isn 't another " good news . " only there are some who trouble you , and want to pervert the Good News of Christ .
but even though we , or an angel from heaven , should preach to you any " good news " other than that which we preached to you , let him be Cursed .
as we have said before , so I now say again : if any man preaches to you any " good news " other than that which you received , let him be Cursed .
for am I now seeking the favor of men , or of God ? or am I striving to please men ? for if I were still pleasing men , I wouldn 't be a servant of Christ .
but I make known to you , brothers , concerning the Good News which was preached by me , that it is not according to man .
for neither did I receive it from man , nor was I taught it , but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ .
for you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God , and ravaged it .
I advanced in the Jews ' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen , being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers .
but when it was the good pleasure of God , who separated me from my mother 's womb , and called me through his grace ,
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me , but I went away into Arabia . then I returned to Damascus .
then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter , and stayed with him fifteen days .
but of the other Apostles I saw no one , except James , the Lord 's brother .
now about the things which I write to you , behold , before God , I 'm not lying .
then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ ,
but they only heard : " he who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy . "
and they glorified God in me .
then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking Titus also with me .
but not even Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised .
to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection , not for an hour , that the truth of the Good News might continue with you .
but from those who were reputed to be important ( whatever they were , it makes no difference to me ; God doesn 't show partiality to man ) --they , I say , who were respected imparted nothing to me ,
but to the contrary , when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision , even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision
( for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles ) ;
they only asked us to remember the poor--which very thing I was also zealous to do .
but when Peter came to Antioch , I resisted him to his face , because he stood condemned .
and the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy ; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy .
" we , being Jews by nature , and not Gentile sinners ,
but if , while we sought to be justified in Christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is Christ a servant of sin ? certainly not !
for if I build up again those things which I destroyed , I prove myself a law @-@ breaker .
for I , through the law , died to the law , that I might live to God .
I don 't make void the grace of God . for if righteousness is through the law , then Christ died for nothing ! "
foolish Galatians , who has bewitched you not to obey the truth , before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as crucified ?
I just want to learn this from you . did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by hearing of faith ?
are you so foolish ? having begun in the Spirit , are you now completed in the flesh ?
did you suffer so many things in vain , if it is indeed in vain ?
he therefore who supplies the Spirit to you , and works miracles among you , does he do it by the works of the law , or by hearing of faith ?
even as Abraham " believed God , and it was counted to him for righteousness . "
know therefore that those who are of faith , the same are children of Abraham .
the Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham , saying , " In you all the nations will be blessed . "
so then , those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse . for it is written , " Cursed is everyone who doesn 't continue in all things that are written in the book of the law , to do them . "
now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident , for , " The righteous will live by faith . "
the law is not of faith , but , " The man who does them will live by them . "
brothers , speaking of human terms , though it is only a man 's Covenant , yet when it has been confirmed , no one makes it void , or adds to it .
now I say this . a Covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ , the law , which came four hundred thirty years after , does not annul , so as to make the promise of no effect .
for if the inheritance is of the law , it is no more of promise ; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise .
now a mediator is not between one , but God is one .
is the law then against the promises of God ? certainly not ! for if there had been a law given which could make alive , most certainly righteousness would have been of the law .
but the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin , that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
but before faith came , we were kept in custody under the law , confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
so that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
but now that faith has come , we are no longer under a tutor .
for you are all children of God , through faith in Christ Jesus .
for as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
there is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free man , there is neither male nor female ; for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
if you are Christ 's , then you are Abraham 's seed and heirs according to promise .
but I say that so long as the heir is a child , he is no different from a bondservant , though he is lord of all ;
but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father .
so we also , when we were children , were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world .
and because you are children , God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , crying , " ABBA , Father ! "
so you are no longer a bondservant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir of God through Christ .
however at that time , not knowing God , you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods .
you observe days , months , seasons , and years .
I am afraid for you , that I might have wasted my labor for you .
I beg you , brothers , become as I am , for I also have become as you are . you did me no wrong ,
but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time .
what was the blessing you enjoyed ? for I testify to you that , if possible , you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
so then , have I become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
they zealously seek you in no good way . no , they desire to alienate you , that you may seek them .
but it is always good to be zealous in a good cause , and not only when I am present with you .
my little children , of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you--
but I could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone , for I am perplexed about you .
tell me , you that desire to be under the law , don 't you listen to the law ?
for it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the handmaid , and one by the free woman .
however , the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh , but the son by the free woman was born through promise .
these things contain an allegory , for these are two covenants . one is from Mount Sinai , bearing children to bondage , which is Hagar .
for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia , and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now , for she is in bondage with her children .
but the Jerusalem that is above is free , which is the mother of us all .
now we , brothers , as Isaac was , are children of promise .
but as then , he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , so also it is now .
however what does the Scripture say ? " throw out the handmaid and her son , for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman . "
so then , brothers , we are not children of a handmaid , but of the free woman .
stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free , and don 't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage .
behold , I , Paul , tell you that if you receive circumcision , Christ will profit you nothing .
yes , I testify again to every man who receives circumcision , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
you are alienated from Christ , you who desire to be justified by the law . you have fallen away from grace .
for we , through the Spirit , by faith wait for the hope of righteousness .
for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything , nor uncircumcision , but faith working through love .
you were running well ! who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth ?
this persuasion is not from him who calls you .
a little yeast grows through the whole lump .
I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way . but he who troubles you will bear his judgment , whoever he is .
but I , brothers , if I still preach circumcision , why am I still persecuted ? then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed .
I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off .
for you , brothers , were called for freedom . only don 't use your freedom for gain to the flesh , but through love be servants to one another .
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word , in this : " you shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
but if you bite and devour one another , be careful that you don 't consume one another .
but I say , walk by the Spirit , and you won 't fulfill the lust of the flesh .
for the flesh lusts against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; and these are contrary to one another , that you may not do the things that you desire .
but if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
but the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , Goodness , faith ,
those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts .
if we live by the Spirit , let 's also walk by the Spirit .
let 's not become conceited , provoking one another , and envying one another .
brothers , even if a man is caught in some fault , you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness ; looking to yourself so that you also aren 't tempted .
bear one another 's burdens , and so fulfill the law of Christ .
for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
but let each man test his own work , and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor .
for each man will bear his own burden .
but let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches .
Don 't be deceived . God is not mocked , for whatever a man sows , that he will also reap .
for he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption . but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
let us not be weary in doing good , for we will reap in due season , if we don 't give up .
so then , as we have opportunity , let 's do what is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
see with what large letters I write to you with my own hand .
as many as desire to look good in the flesh , they compel you to be circumcised ; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
for even they who receive circumcision don 't keep the law themselves , but they desire to have you circumcised , that they may boast in your flesh .
but far be it from me to boast , except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
for in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creation .
as many as walk by this rule , peace and mercy be on them , and on God 's Israel .
from now on , let no one cause me any trouble , for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body .
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers . Amen .
Paul , an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , to the saints who are at Ephesus , and the faithful in Christ Jesus :
grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ ;
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love ;
having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his desire ,
in whom we have our redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace ,
making known to us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
to an administration of the fullness of the times , to sum up all things in Christ , the things in the heavens , and the things on the earth , in him ;
in whom also we were assigned an inheritance , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ;
to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory , we who had before hoped in Christ :
in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Good News of your salvation--in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise ,
who is a pledge of our inheritance , to the redemption of God 's own possession , to the praise of his glory .
for this cause I also , having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you , and the love which you have toward all the saints ,
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ;
far above all rule , and authority , and power , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this age , but also in that which is to come .
he put all things in subjection under his feet , and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly ,
which is his body , the fullness of him who fills all in all .
but God , being rich in mercy , for his great love with which he loved us ,
and raised us up with him , and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus ,
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus ;
for by grace you have been saved through faith , and that not of yourselves ; it is the gift of God ,
not of works , that no one would boast .
for we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God prepared before that we would walk in them .
that you were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
but now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ .
he came and preached peace to you who were far off and to those who were near .
for through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father .
so then you are no longer strangers and foreigners , but you are fellow citizens with the saints , and of the household of God ,
being built on the foundation of the Apostles and prophets , Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone ;
in whom the whole building , fitted together , grows into a holy temple in the Lord ;
in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit .
for this cause I , Paul , am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles ,
if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you ;
how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me , as I wrote before in few words ,
by which , when you read , you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ ;
which in other generations was not made known to the children of men , as it has now been revealed to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit ;
that the Gentiles are fellow heirs , and fellow members of the body , and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News ,
of which I was made a servant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places ,
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord ;
in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him .
therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you , which are your glory .
for this cause , I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that works in us ,
to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever . Amen .
I therefore , the prisoner in the Lord , beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called ,
with all lowliness and humility , with patience , bearing with one another in love ;
being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
but to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
therefore he says , " When he ascended on high , he led captivity captive , and gave gifts to men . "
now this , " He ascended , " what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth ?
he who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens , that he might fill all things .
he gave some to be Apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , Evangelists ; and some , shepherds and teachers ;
for the perfecting of the saints , to the work of serving , to the building up of the body of Christ ;
until we all attain to the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a full grown man , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ;
that we may no longer be children , tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the trickery of men , in craftiness , after the wiles of error ;
but speaking truth in love , we may grow up in all things into him , who is the head , Christ ;
from whom all the body , being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk , in the futility of their mind ,
being darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their hearts ;
who having become callous gave themselves up to lust , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
but you did not learn Christ that way ;
if indeed you heard him , and were taught in him , even as truth is in Jesus :
that you put away , as concerning your former way of life , the old man , that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit ;
and put on the new man , who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth .
therefore putting away falsehood , speak truth each one with his neighbor . for we are members of one another .
" be angry , and don 't sin . " Don 't let the sun go down on your wrath ,
neither give place to the devil .
let him who stole steal no more ; but rather let him labor , working with his hands the thing that is good , that he may have something to give to him who has need .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
Don 't grieve the Holy Spirit of God , in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
let all bitterness , wrath , anger , outcry , and slander , be put away from you , with all malice .
and be kind to one another , tenderhearted , forgiving each other , just as God also in Christ forgave you .
be therefore imitators of God , as beloved children .
walk in love , even as Christ also loved you , and gave himself up for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet @-@ smelling fragrance .
but sexual immorality , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not even be mentioned among you , as becomes saints ;
nor filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor jesting , which are not appropriate ; but rather giving of thanks .
know this for sure , that no sexually immoral person , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God .
let no one deceive you with empty words . for because of these things , the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience .
therefore don 't be partakers with them .
for you were once darkness , but are now light in the Lord . walk as children of light ,
for the fruit of the Spirit is in all Goodness and righteousness and truth ,
proving what is well pleasing to the Lord .
have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather even reprove them .
for the things which are done by them in secret , it is a shame even to speak of .
but all things , when they are reproved , are revealed by the light , for everything that reveals is light .
therefore he says , " awake , you who sleep , and arise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you . "
therefore watch carefully how you walk , not as unwise , but as wise ;
redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
therefore don 't be foolish , but understand what the will of the Lord is .
Don 't be drunken with wine , in which is dissipation , but be filled with the Spirit ,
speaking to one another in psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs ; singing , and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to God , even the Father ;
subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ .
wives , be subject to your own husbands , as to the Lord .
for the husband is the head of the wife , and Christ also is the head of the assembly , being himself the Savior of the body .
but as the assembly is subject to Christ , so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything .
husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the assembly , and gave himself up for it ;
that he might sanctify it , having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word ,
that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously , not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies . he who loves his own wife loves himself .
for no man ever hated his own flesh ; but nourishes and cherishes it , even as the Lord also does the assembly ;
because we are members of his body , of his flesh and bones .
" for this cause a man will leave his father and mother , and will be joined to his wife . the two will become one flesh . "
this mystery is great , but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly .
nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself ; and let the wife see that she respects her husband .
children , obey your parents in the Lord , for this is right .
" honor your father and mother , " which is the first commandment with a promise :
you fathers , don 't provoke your children to wrath , but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord .
servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as to Christ ;
not in the way of service only when eyes are on you , as men pleasers ; but as servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart ;
with good will doing service , as to the Lord , and not to men ;
knowing that whatever good thing each one does , he will receive the same again from the Lord , whether he is bound or free .
you masters , do the same things to them , and give up threatening , knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is no partiality with him .
finally , be strong in the Lord , and in the strength of his might .
put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
for our wrestling is not against flesh and blood , but against the principalities , against the powers , against the world 's rulers of the darkness of this age , and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places .
therefore put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to withstand in the evil day , and , having done all , to stand .
stand therefore , having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
above all , taking up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one .
and take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God ;
with all prayer and requests , praying at all times in the Spirit , and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints :
on my behalf , that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth , to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News ,
for which I am an ambassador in chains ; that in it I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
but that you also may know my affairs , how I am doing , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ;
whom I have sent to you for this very purpose , that you may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts .
peace be to the brothers , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love . Amen .
Paul and Timothy , servants of Jesus Christ ; To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi , with the overseers and servants :
grace to you , and peace from God , our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
I thank my God whenever I remember you ,
always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy ,
being confident of this very thing , that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ .
for God is my witness , how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus .
this I pray , that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment ;
so that you may approve the things that are excellent ; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ ;
now I desire to have you know , brothers , that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News ;
so that it became evident to the whole palace guard , and to all the rest , that my bonds are in Christ ;
and that most of the brothers in the Lord , being confident through my bonds , are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear .
some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife , and some also out of good will .
the former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition , thinking that they add affliction to my chains ;
but the latter out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News .
what does it matter ? only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed . I rejoice in this , yes , and will rejoice .
for I know that this will turn out to my salvation , through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
for to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
but if I live on in the flesh , this will bring fruit from my work ; yet I don 't know what I will choose .
but I am in a dilemma between the two , having the desire to depart and be with Christ , which is far better .
yet , to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake .
having this confidence , I know that I will remain , yes , and remain with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again .
doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit , but in humility , each counting others better than himself ;
each of you not just looking to his own things , but each of you also to the things of others .
have this in your mind , which was also in Christ Jesus ,
who , existing in the form of God , didn 't consider equality with God a thing to be grasped ,
but emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being made in the likeness of men .
therefore God also highly exalted him , and gave to him the name which is above every name ;
so then , my beloved , even as you have always obeyed , not only in my presence , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
for it is God who works in you both to will and to work , for his good pleasure .
yes , and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice , and rejoice with you all .
in the same way , you also rejoice , and rejoice with me .
but I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing .
for I have no one else like @-@ minded , who will truly care about you .
for they all seek their own , not the things of Jesus Christ .
but you know the proof of him , that , as a child serves a father , so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News .
therefore I hope to send him at once , as soon as I see how it will go with me .
but I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly .
but I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , fellow worker , fellow soldier , and your Apostle and servant of my need ;
since he longed for you all , and was very troubled , because you had heard that he was sick .
for indeed he was sick , nearly to death , but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sorrow on sorrow .
I have sent him therefore the more diligently , that , when you see him again , you may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy , and hold such in honor ,
because for the work of Christ he came near to death , risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me .
finally , my brothers , rejoice in the Lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not tiresome , but for you it is safe .
beware of the dogs , beware of the evil workers , beware of the false circumcision .
for we are the circumcision , who worship God in the Spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh ;
though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh . if any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh , I yet more :
circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; concerning the law , a Pharisee ;
concerning zeal , persecuting the assembly ; concerning the righteousness which is in the law , found blameless .
however , what things were gain to me , these have I counted loss for Christ .
that I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , becoming conformed to his death ;
not that I have already obtained , or am already made perfect ; but I press on , if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus .
let us therefore , as many as are perfect , think this way . if in anything you think otherwise , God will also reveal that to you .
nevertheless , to the extent that we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule . let us be of the same mind .
brothers , be imitators together of me , and note those who walk this way , even as you have us for an example .
for many walk , of whom I told you often , and now tell you even weeping , as the enemies of the cross of Christ ,
whose end is destruction , whose god is the belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who think about earthly things .
for our citizenship is in heaven , from where we also wait for a Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ;
who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
therefore , my brothers , beloved and longed for , my joy and crown , so stand firm in the Lord , my beloved .
I exhort Euodia , and I exhort Syntyche , to think the same way in the Lord .
rejoice in the Lord always ! again I will say , " rejoice ! "
let your gentleness be known to all men . the Lord is at hand .
in nothing be anxious , but in everything , by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving , let your requests be made known to God .
and the peace of God , which surpasses all understanding , will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus .
finally , brothers , whatever things are true , whatever things are honorable , whatever things are just , whatever things are pure , whatever things are lovely , whatever things are of good report ; if there is any virtue , and if there is any praise , think about these things .
the things which you learned , received , heard , and saw in me : do these things , and the God of peace will be with you .
but I rejoice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revived your thought for me ; in which you did indeed take thought , but you lacked opportunity .
not that I speak in respect to lack , for I have learned in whatever state I am , to be content in it .
I can do all things through Christ , who strengthens me .
however you did well that you shared in my affliction .
you yourselves also know , you Philippians , that in the beginning of the Good News , when I departed from Macedonia , no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only .
for even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need .
not that I seek for the gift , but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account .
my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever ! Amen .
greet every saint in Christ Jesus . the brothers who are with me greet you .
all the saints greet you , especially those who are of Caesar 's household .
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
we give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which you have toward all the saints ,
even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant , who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf ,
who also declared to us your love in the Spirit .
for this cause , we also , since the day we heard this , don 't cease praying and making requests for you , that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
that you may walk worthily of the Lord , to please him in all respects , bearing fruit in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
strengthened with all power , according to the might of his glory , for all endurance and perseverance with joy ;
giving thanks to the Father , who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light ;
who delivered us out of the power of darkness , and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love ;
in whom we have our redemption , the forgiveness of our sins ;
who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation .
for by him all things were created , in the heavens and on the earth , things visible and things invisible , whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and for him .
he is before all things , and in him all things are held together .
he is the head of the body , the assembly , who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he might have the preeminence .
for all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him ;
and through him to reconcile all things to himself , by him , whether things on the earth , or things in the heavens , having made peace through the blood of his cross .
you , being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works ,
yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him ,
now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body 's sake , which is the assembly ;
whom we proclaim , admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus ;
for which I also labor , striving according to his working , which works in me mightily .
for I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you , and for those at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ;
now this I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech .
for though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejoicing and seeing your order , and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ .
as therefore you received Christ Jesus , the Lord , walk in him ,
rooted and built up in him , and established in the faith , even as you were taught , abounding in it in Thanksgiving .
be careful that you don 't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the elements of the world , and not after Christ .
for in him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily ,
and in him you are made full , who is the head of all principality and power ;
in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ ;
having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
you were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh . he made you alive together with him , having forgiven us all our trespasses ,
wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us ; and he has taken it out of the way , nailing it to the cross ;
having stripped the principalities and the powers , he made a show of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
let no one therefore judge you in eating , or in drinking , or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day ,
which are a shadow of the things to come ; but the body is Christ 's .
( all of which perish with use ) , according to the precepts and doctrines of men ?
if then you were raised together with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is , seated on the right hand of God .
set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are on the earth .
for you died , and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
when Christ , our life , is revealed , then you will also be revealed with him in glory .
put to death therefore your members which are on the earth : sexual immorality , uncleanness , depraved passion , evil desire , and covetousness , which is idolatry ;
for which things ' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience .
you also once walked in those , when you lived in them ;
but now you also put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , slander , and shameful speaking out of your mouth .
Don 't lie to one another , seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings ,
and have put on the new man , who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator ,
where there can 't be Greek and Jew , circumcision and uncircumcision , barbarian , Scythian , bondservant , Freeman ; but Christ is all , and in all .
put on therefore , as God 's chosen ones , holy and beloved , a heart of compassion , kindness , lowliness , humility , and perseverance ;
bearing with one another , and forgiving each other , if any man has a complaint against any ; even as Christ forgave you , so you also do .
above all these things , walk in love , which is the bond of perfection .
and let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to which also you were called in one body ; and be thankful .
whatever you do , in word or in deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father , through him .
wives , be in subjection to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
husbands , love your wives , and don 't be bitter against them .
children , obey your parents in all things , for this pleases the Lord .
fathers , don 't provoke your children , so that they won 't be discouraged .
servants , obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh , not just when they are looking , as men pleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing God .
and whatever you do , work heartily , as for the Lord , and not for men ,
but he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done , and there is no partiality .
Masters , give to your servants that which is just and equal , knowing that you also have a Master in heaven .
continue steadfastly in prayer , watching therein with Thanksgiving ;
praying together for us also , that God may open to us a door for the word , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds ;
that I may reveal it as I ought to speak .
walk in wisdom toward those who are outside , redeeming the time .
let your speech always be with grace , seasoned with salt , that you may know how you ought to answer each one .
all my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus , the beloved brother , faithful servant , and fellow bondservant in the Lord .
I am sending him to you for this very purpose , that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts ,
together with Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they will make known to you everything that is going on here .
Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , greets you , and Mark , the cousin of Barnabas ( concerning whom you received commandments , " if he comes to you , receive him " ) ,
and Jesus who is called Justus . these are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God who are of the circumcision , men who have been a comfort to me .
for I testify about him , that he has great zeal for you , and for those in Laodicea , and for those in Hierapolis .
greet the brothers who are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the assembly that is in his house .
when this letter has been read among you , cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans ; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea .
tell Archippus , " Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord , that you fulfill it . "
the salutation of me , Paul , with my own hand : remember my bonds . grace be with you . Amen .
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
we know , brothers loved by God , that you are chosen ,
and that our Good News came to you not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spirit , and with much assurance . you know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake .
you became imitators of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Spirit ,
so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia .
for from you the word of the Lord has been declared , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out ; so that we need not to say anything .
for you yourselves know , brothers , our visit to you wasn 't in vain ,
but having suffered before and been shamefully treated , as you know , at Philippi , we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict .
for our exhortation is not of error , nor of uncleanness , nor in deception .
but even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News , so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , who tests our hearts .
for neither were we at any time found using words of flattery , as you know , nor a cloak of covetousness ( God is witness ) ,
nor seeking glory from men ( neither from you nor from others ) , when we might have claimed authority as Apostles of Christ .
but we were gentle among you , like a nursing mother cherishes her own children .
even so , affectionately longing for you , we were well pleased to impart to you , not the Good News of God only , but also our own souls , because you had become very dear to us .
for you remember , brothers , our labor and travail ; for working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we preached to you the Good News of God .
you are witnesses with God , how holy , righteously , and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe .
as you know , we exhorted , comforted , and implored every one of you , as a father does his own children ,
to the end that you should walk worthily of God , who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory .
because we wanted to come to you--indeed , I , Paul , once and again--but Satan hindered us .
for what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? Isn 't it even you , before our Lord Jesus at his coming ?
for most certainly , when we were with you , we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction , even as it happened , and you know .
for this cause , brothers , we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith .
for now we live , if you stand fast in the Lord .
for what Thanksgiving can we render again to God for you , for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God ;
night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face , and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
now may our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way to you ;
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints .
for you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus .
for this is the will of God : your sanctification , that you abstain from sexual immorality ,
that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor ,
that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter ; because the Lord is an avenger in all these things , as also we forewarned you and testified .
for God called us not for uncleanness , but in sanctification .
therefore he who rejects this doesn 't reject man , but God , who has also given his Holy Spirit to you .
but concerning brotherly love , you have no need that one write to you . for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another ,
for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia . but we exhort you , brothers , that you abound more and more ;
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
that you may walk properly toward those who are outside , and may have need of nothing .
but we don 't want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen asleep , so that you don 't grieve like the rest , who have no hope .
for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus .
for this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep .
for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the Archangel , and with God 's trumpet . the dead in Christ will rise first ,
then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air . so we will be with the Lord forever .
therefore comfort one another with these words .
but concerning the times and the seasons , brothers , you have no need that anything be written to you .
for you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night .
for when they are saying , " Peace and safety , " then sudden destruction will come on them , like birth pains on a pregnant woman ; and they will in no way escape .
but you , brothers , aren 't in darkness , that the day should overtake you like a thief .
you are all children of light , and children of the day . we don 't belong to the night , nor to darkness ,
so then let 's not sleep , as the rest do , but let 's watch and be sober .
for those who sleep , sleep in the night , and those who are drunk are drunk in the night .
but let us , since we belong to the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love , and , for a helmet , the hope of salvation .
for God didn 't appoint us to wrath , but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him .
therefore exhort one another , and build each other up , even as you also do .
but we beg you , brothers , to know those who labor among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ,
and to respect and honor them in love for their work 's sake . be at peace among yourselves .
we exhort you , brothers , admonish the disorderly , encourage the fainthearted , support the weak , be patient toward all .
see that no one returns evil for evil to anyone , but always follow after that which is good , for one another , and for all .
pray without ceasing .
in everything give thanks , for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you .
Don 't quench the Spirit .
test all things , and hold firmly that which is good .
abstain from every form of evil .
May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely . May your whole spirit , soul , and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
he who calls you is faithful , who will also do it .
brothers , pray for us .
greet all the brothers with a holy kiss .
I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers .
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ :
grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith grows exceedingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds ;
so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure .
this is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God , to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God , for which you also suffer .
that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
let no one deceive you in any way . for it will not be , unless the departure comes first , and the man of sin is revealed , the son of destruction ,
Don 't you remember that , when I was still with you , I told you these things ?
now you know what is restraining him , to the end that he may be revealed in his own season .
for the mystery of lawlessness already works . only there is one who restrains now , until he is taken out of the way .
then the lawless one will be revealed , whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth , and destroy by the manifestation of his coming ;
because of this , God sends them a working of error , that they should believe a lie ;
that they all might be judged who didn 't believe the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
to which he called you through our Good News , for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
so then , brothers , stand firm , and hold the traditions which you were taught by us , whether by word , or by letter .
finally , brothers , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified , even as also with you ;
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men ; for not all have faith .
but the Lord is faithful , who will establish you , and guard you from the evil one .
we have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you both do and will do the things we command .
May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patience of Christ .
now we command you , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion , and not after the tradition which they received from us .
for you know how you ought to imitate us . for we didn 't behave ourselves rebelliously among you ,
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in labor and travail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
not because we don 't have the right , but to make ourselves an example to you , that you should imitate us .
for even when we were with you , we commanded you this : " if anyone will not work , neither let him eat . "
for we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion , who don 't work at all , but are busybodies .
now those who are that way , we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
but you , brothers , don 't be weary in doing well .
if any man doesn 't obey our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be ashamed .
Don 't count him as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . the Lord be with you all .
the greeting of me , Paul , with my own hand , which is the sign in every letter : this is how I write .
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
but the goal of this command is love , out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith ;
from which things some , having missed the mark , have turned aside to vain talking ;
desiring to be teachers of the law , though they understand neither what they say , nor about what they strongly affirm .
but we know that the law is good , if a man uses it lawfully ,
according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
and I thank him who enabled me , Christ Jesus our Lord , because he counted me faithful , appointing me to service ;
although I was before a blasphemer , a persecutor , and insolent . however , I obtained mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief .
the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
the saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
now to the King eternal , Immortal , invisible , to God who alone is wise , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
this instruction I commit to you , my child Timothy , according to the prophecies which led the way to you , that by them you may wage the good warfare ;
holding faith and a good conscience ; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith ;
of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I delivered to Satan , that they might be taught not to blaspheme .
for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior ;
who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth .
to which I was appointed a preacher and an Apostle ( I am telling the truth in Christ , not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
I desire therefore that the men in every place pray , lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting .
let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection .
but I don 't permit a woman to teach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in quietness .
for Adam was first formed , then Eve .
but she will be saved through her childbearing , if they continue in faith , love , and sanctification with sobriety .
this is a faithful saying : if a man seeks the office of an overseer , he desires a good work .
the overseer therefore must be without reproach , the husband of one wife , temperate , sensible , modest , hospitable , good at teaching ;
not a drinker , not violent , not greedy for money , but gentle , not quarrelsome , not covetous ;
one who rules his own house well , having children in subjection with all reverence ;
( but if a man doesn 't know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
not a new convert , lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil .
moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside , to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil .
servants , in the same way , must be reverent , not double @-@ tongued , not addicted to much wine , not greedy for money ;
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
let them also first be tested ; then let them serve if they are blameless .
their wives in the same way must be reverent , not slanderers , temperate , faithful in all things .
let servants be husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
for those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
for every creature of God is good , and nothing is to be rejected , if it is received with Thanksgiving .
for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer .
if you instruct the brothers of these things , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , nourished in the words of the faith , and of the good doctrine which you have followed .
but refuse profane and old wives ' fables . exercise yourself toward godliness .
for bodily exercise has some value , but godliness has value in all things , having the promise of the life which is now , and of that which is to come .
this saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance .
for to this end we both labor and suffer reproach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
command and teach these things .
let no man despise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity .
until I come , pay attention to reading , to exhortation , and to teaching .
Don 't neglect the gift that is in you , which was given to you by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the elders .
be diligent in these things . give yourself wholly to them , that your progress may be revealed to all .
pay attention to yourself , and to your teaching . continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
Don 't rebuke an older man , but exhort him as a father ; the younger men as brothers ;
honor widows who are widows indeed .
now she who is a widow indeed , and desolate , has her hope set on God , and continues in petitions and prayers night and day .
but she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives .
also command these things , that they may be without reproach .
but if anyone doesn 't provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
but refuse younger widows , for when they have grown wanton against Christ , they desire to marry ;
having condemnation , because they have rejected their first pledge .
besides , they also learn to be idle , going about from house to house . not only idle , but also gossips and busybodies , saying things which they ought not .
I desire therefore that the younger widows marry , bear children , rule the household , and give no occasion to the adversary for insulting .
for already some have turned aside after Satan .
if any man or woman who believes has widows , let them relieve them , and don 't let the assembly be burdened ; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed .
let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching .
for the Scripture says , " You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain . " and , " The laborer is worthy of his wages . "
Don 't receive an accusation against an elder , except at the word of two or three witnesses .
those who sin , reprove in the sight of all , that the rest also may be in fear .
I command you in the sight of God , and Christ Jesus , and the chosen angels , that you observe these things without prejudice , doing nothing by partiality .
lay hands hastily on no one , neither be a participant in other men 's sins . keep yourself pure .
be no longer a drinker of water only , but use a little wine for your stomach 's sake and your frequent infirmities .
some men 's sins are evident , preceding them to judgment , and some also follow later .
in the same way also there are good works that are obvious , and those that are otherwise can 't be hidden .
let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed .
but godliness with contentment is great gain .
for we brought nothing into the world , and we certainly can 't carry anything out .
but having food and clothing , we will be content with that .
but those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts , such as drown men in ruin and destruction .
for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . some have been led astray from the faith in their greed , and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
but you , man of God , flee these things , and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , and gentleness .
fight the good fight of faith . lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called , and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses .
that they do good , that they be rich in good works , that they be ready to distribute , willing to communicate ;
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold of eternal life .
Timothy , guard that which is committed to you , turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called ;
which some professing have erred concerning the faith . grace be with you . Amen .
I thank God , whom I serve as my forefathers did , with a pure conscience . how unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions , night and day
longing to see you , remembering your tears , that I may be filled with joy ;
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lois , and your mother Eunice , and , I am persuaded , in you also .
for this cause , I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
for God didn 't give us a spirit of fear , but of power , love , and self @-@ control .
therefore don 't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner ; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God ,
for this , I was appointed as a preacher , an Apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
that good thing which was committed to you , guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us .
this you know , that all who are in Asia turned away from me ; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes .
May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus , for he often refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain ,
but when he was in Rome , he sought me diligently , and found me
( the Lord grant to him to find the Lord 's mercy in that day ) ; and in how many things he served at Ephesus , you know very well .
you therefore , my child , be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to faithful men , who will be able to teach others also .
you therefore must endure hardship , as a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
no soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life , that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier .
also , if anyone competes in athletics , he isn 't crowned unless he has competed by the rules .
the farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops .
consider what I say , and may the Lord give you understanding in all things .
remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , of the seed of David , according to my Good News ,
in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal . but God 's word isn 't chained .
therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones ' sake , that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
this saying is faithful : " for if we died with him , we will also live with him .
if we endure , we will also reign with him . if we deny him , he also will deny us .
if we are Faithless , he remains faithful . he can 't deny himself . "
remind them of these things , charging them in the sight of the Lord , that they don 't argue about words , to no profit , to the subverting of those who hear .
give diligence to present yourself approved by God , a workman who doesn 't need to be ashamed , properly handling the Word of Truth .
but shun empty chatter , for it will go further in ungodliness ,
and those words will consume like gangrene , of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus ;
men who have erred concerning the truth , saying that the resurrection is already past , and overthrowing the faith of some .
now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of clay . some are for honor , and some for dishonor .
if anyone therefore purges himself from these , he will be a vessel for honor , sanctified , and suitable for the master 's use , prepared for every good work .
flee from youthful lusts ; but pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
but refuse foolish and ignorant questionings , knowing that they generate strife .
the Lord 's servant must not quarrel , but be gentle towards all , able to teach , patient ,
in gentleness correcting those who oppose him : perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth ,
and they may recover themselves out of the devil 's snare , having been taken captive by him to his will .
but know this , that in the last days , grievous times will come .
traitors , headstrong , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ;
even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so do these also oppose the truth ; men corrupted in mind , who concerning the faith , are rejected .
but they will proceed no further . for their Folly will be evident to all men , as theirs also came to be .
yes , and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution .
but evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse , deceiving and being deceived .
every Scripture is God @-@ breathed and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for instruction in righteousness ,
that the man of God may be complete , thoroughly equipped for every good work .
for the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine , but , having itching ears , will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts ;
and will turn away their ears from the truth , and turn aside to fables .
but you be sober in all things , suffer hardship , do the work of an Evangelist , and fulfill your ministry .
for I am already being offered , and the time of my departure has come .
I have fought the good fight . I have finished the course . I have kept the faith .
be diligent to come to me soon ,
for Demas left me , having loved this present world , and went to Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia .
only Luke is with me . take Mark , and bring him with you , for he is useful to me for service .
but I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come , and the books , especially the parchments .
Alexander , the coppersmith , did much evil to me . the Lord will repay him according to his works ,
of whom you also must beware ; for he greatly opposed our words .
at my first defense , no one came to help me , but all left me . May it not be held against them .
but the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gentiles might hear ; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
greet Prisca and Aquila , and the house of Onesiphorus .
Erastus remained at Corinth , but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick .
be diligent to come before winter . Eubulus salutes you , as do Pudens , Linus , Claudia , and all the brothers .
the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . grace be with you . Amen .
in hope of eternal life , which God , who can 't lie , promised before time began ;
but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior ;
to Titus , my true child according to a common faith : grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior .
I left you in Crete for this reason , that you would set in order the things that were lacking , and appoint elders in every city , as I directed you ;
if anyone is blameless , the husband of one wife , having children who believe , who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior .
for the overseer must be blameless , as God 's steward ; not self @-@ pleasing , not easily angered , not given to wine , not violent , not greedy for dishonest gain ;
but given to hospitality , a lover of good , sober minded , fair , holy , self @-@ controlled ;
holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching , that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine , and to convict those who contradict him .
for there are also many unruly men , vain talkers and deceivers , especially those of the circumcision ,
whose mouths must be stopped ; men who overthrow whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for dishonest gain 's sake .
one of them , a prophet of their own , said , " Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , and idle gluttons . "
this testimony is true . for this cause , reprove them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ,
to the pure , all things are pure ; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving , nothing is pure ; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled .
they profess that they know God , but by their works they deny him , being abominable , disobedient , and unfit for any good work .
but say the things which fit sound doctrine ,
that older men should be temperate , sensible , sober minded , sound in faith , in love , and in patience :
and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior , not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine , teachers of that which is good ;
likewise , exhort the younger men to be sober minded ;
Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters , and to be well @-@ pleasing in all things ; not contradicting ;
not stealing , but showing all good fidelity ; that they may adorn the doctrine of God , our Savior , in all things .
for the grace of God has appeared , bringing salvation to all men ,
instructing us to the intent that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we would live soberly , righteously , and godly in this present world ;
looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior , Jesus Christ ;
who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify for himself a people for his own possession , zealous for good works .
say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority . let no man despise you .
remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities , to be obedient , to be ready for every good work ,
to speak evil of no one , not to be contentious , to be gentle , showing all humility toward all men .
for we were also once foolish , disobedient , deceived , serving various lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , and hating one another .
that , being justified by his grace , we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
but shun foolish questionings , genealogies , strife , and disputes about the law ; for they are unprofitable and vain .
avoid a factious man after a first and second warning ;
knowing that such a one is perverted , and sins , being self @-@ condemned .
when I send Artemas to you , or Tychicus , be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis , for I have determined to winter there .
send Zenas , the lawyer , and Apollos on their journey speedily , that nothing may be lacking for them .
let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses , that they may not be unfruitful .
all who are with me greet you . greet those who love us in faith . grace be with you all . Amen .
Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , to Philemon , our beloved fellow worker ,
grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
I thank my God always , making mention of you in my prayers ,
that the fellowship of your faith may become effective , in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus .
for we have much joy and comfort in your love , because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you , brother .
therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate ,
I am sending him back . therefore receive him , that is , my own heart ,
for perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while , that you would have him forever ,
if then you count me a partner , receive him as you would receive me .
but if he has wronged you at all , or owes you anything , put that to my account .
I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides ) .
yes , brother , let me have joy from you in the Lord . Refresh my heart in the Lord .
having confidence in your obedience , I write to you , knowing that you will do even beyond what I say .
also , prepare a guest room for me , for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you .
Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , greets you ,
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
God , having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways ,
has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds .
having become so much better than the angels , as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have .
for to which of the angels did he say at any time , " You are my Son . today have I become your father ? " and again , " I will be to him a Father , and he will be to me a Son ? "
again , when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says , " Let all the angels of God worship him . "
of the angels he says , " Who makes his angels winds , and his servants a flame of fire . "
but of the Son he says , " Your throne , O God , is forever and ever . the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom .
you have loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows . "
and , " You , Lord , in the beginning , laid the foundation of the earth . the heavens are the works of your hands .
they will perish , but you continue . they all will grow old like a garment does .
as a mantle , you will roll them up , and they will be changed ; but you are the same . your years will not fail . "
but which of the angels has he told at any time , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet ? "
Aren 't they all serving spirits , sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation ?
therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard , lest perhaps we drift away .
God also testifying with them , both by signs and wonders , by various works of power , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit , according to his own will ?
for he didn 't subject the world to come , of which we speak , to angels .
but one has somewhere testified , saying , " What is man , that you think of him ? or the son of man , that you care for him ?
you made him a little lower than the angels . you crowned him with glory and honor .
you have put all things in subjection under his feet . " for in that he subjected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . but now we don 't see all things subjected to him , yet .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to glory , to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
for both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one , for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers ,
saying , " I will declare your name to my brothers . in the midst of the Congregation I will sing your praise . "
again , " I will put my trust in him . " again , " behold , here I am with the children whom God has given me . "
and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
for most certainly , he doesn 't give help to angels , but he gives help to the seed of Abraham .
therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers , that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make Atonement for the sins of the people .
for in that he himself has suffered being tempted , he is able to help those who are tempted .
therefore , holy brothers , partakers of a heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession , Jesus ;
who was faithful to him who appointed him , as also was Moses in all his house .
for he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses , inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house .
for every house is built by someone ; but he who built all things is God .
Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken ,
but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house ; whose house we are , if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end .
therefore , even as the Holy Spirit says , " Today if you will hear his voice ,
where your fathers tested me by proving me , and saw my works for forty years .
therefore I was displeased with that generation , and said , ' They always err in their heart , but they didn 't know my ways ; '
as I swore in my wrath , ' They will not enter into my rest . ' "
beware , brothers , lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief , in falling away from the living God ;
but exhort one another day by day , so long as it is called " today " ; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
for we have become partakers of Christ , if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end :
while it is said , " Today if you will hear his voice , don 't harden your hearts , as in the rebellion . "
for who , when they heard , rebelled ? no , didn 't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses ?
with whom was he displeased forty years ? Wasn 't it with those who sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ?
to whom did he swear that they wouldn 't enter into his rest , but to those who were disobedient ?
we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief .
let us fear therefore , lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest .
for indeed we have had good news preached to us , even as they also did , but the word they heard didn 't profit them , because it wasn 't mixed with faith by those who heard .
for we who have believed do enter into that rest , even as he has said , " As I swore in my wrath , they will not enter into my rest " ; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
for he has said this somewhere about the seventh day , " God rested on the seventh day from all his works " ;
and in this place again , " They will not enter into my rest . "
seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein , and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience ,
for if Joshua had given them rest , he would not have spoken afterward of another day .
there remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God .
for he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works , as God did from his .
let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest , lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience .
there is no creature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
having then a great high priest , who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold tightly to our confession .
for we don 't have a high priest who can 't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities , but one who has been in all points tempted like we are , yet without sin .
let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy , and may find grace for help in time of need .
for every high priest , being taken from among men , is appointed for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins .
the high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray , because he himself is also surrounded with weakness .
because of this , he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people , as well as for himself .
nobody takes this honor on himself , but he is called by God , just like Aaron was .
so also Christ didn 't glorify himself to be made a high priest , but it was he who said to him , " You are my Son . today I have become your father . "
as he says also in another place , " You are a priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek . "
he , in the days of his flesh , having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his godly fear ,
though he was a Son , yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered .
having been made perfect , he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation ,
named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek .
about him we have many words to say , and hard to interpret , seeing you have become dull of hearing .
for everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness , for he is a baby .
but solid food is for those who are full grown , who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil .
this will we do , if God permits .
for the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receives blessing from God ;
but if it bears thorns and thistles , it is rejected and near being Cursed , whose end is to be burned .
but , beloved , we are persuaded of better things for you , and things that accompany salvation , even though we speak like this .
for God is not unrighteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them .
we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end ,
that you won 't be sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises .
for when God made a promise to Abraham , since he could swear by none greater , he swore by himself ,
saying , " surely blessing I will bless you , and multiplying I will multiply you . "
thus , having patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
for men indeed swear by a greater one , and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation .
in this way God , being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , interposed with an oath ;
this hope we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil ;
where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us , having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek .
for this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of God Most High , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like the Son of God ) , remains a priest continually .
now consider how great this man was , to whom even Abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth out of the best spoils .
they indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest 's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brothers , though these have come out of the body of Abraham ,
but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham , and has blessed him who has the promises .
but without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater .
here people who die receive tithes , but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives .
we can say that through Abraham even Levi , who receives tithes , has paid tithes ,
for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him .
for the priesthood being changed , there is of necessity a change made also in the law .
for he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe , from which no one has officiated at the altar .
for it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah , about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood .
this is yet more abundantly evident , if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest ,
who has been made , not after the law of a fleshly commandment , but after the power of an endless life :
for it is testified , " You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . "
for there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a bringing in of a better hope , through which we draw near to God .
Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath
( for they indeed have been made priests without an oath ) , but he with an oath by him that says of him , " The Lord swore and will not change his mind , ' You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . ' "
by so much , Jesus has become the collateral of a better Covenant .
many , indeed , have been made priests , because they are hindered from continuing by death .
but he , because he lives forever , has his priesthood unchangeable .
therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him , seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them .
for such a high priest was fitting for us : Holy , guiltless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
for the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness , but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected .
for every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices . therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer .
for if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law ;
but now he has obtained a more excellent ministry , by so much as he is also the mediator of a better Covenant , which on better promises has been given as law .
for if that first Covenant had been faultless , then no place would have been sought for a second .
for finding fault with them , he said , " behold , the days come , " says the Lord , " that I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ;
" for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel . after those days , " says the Lord ; " I will put my laws into their mind , I will also write them on their heart . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness . I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more . "
in that he says , " A new Covenant , " he has made the first old . but that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away .
now indeed even the first Covenant had ordinances of divine service , and an earthly sanctuary .
for a tabernacle was prepared . in the first part were the lampstand , the table , and the show bread ; which is called the Holy Place .
after the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies ,
having a golden altar of incense , and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid on all sides with gold , in which was a golden pot holding the manna , Aaron 's rod that budded , and the tablets of the Covenant ;
and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat , of which things we can 't speak now in detail .
now these things having been thus prepared , the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the services ,
but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the errors of the people .
the Holy Spirit is indicating this , that the way into the Holy Place wasn 't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing ;
which is a symbol of the present age , where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable , concerning the conscience , of making the worshipper perfect ;
being only ( with meats and drinks and various washings ) fleshly ordinances , imposed until a time of reformation .
nor yet through the blood of goats and calves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Place , having obtained eternal redemption .
for if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled , sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh :
for where a last will and testament is , there must of necessity be the death of him who made it .
for a will is in force where there has been death , for it is never in force while he who made it lives .
therefore even the first Covenant has not been dedicated without blood .
for when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the calves and the goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
saying , " This is the blood of the Covenant which God has commanded you . "
moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the same way with the blood .
according to the law , nearly everything is cleansed with blood , and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission .
it was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
for Christ hasn 't entered into holy places made with hands , which are representations of the true , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us ;
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own ,
or else wouldn 't they have ceased to be offered , because the worshippers , having been once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sins ?
but in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins .
for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins .
therefore when he comes into the world , he says , " sacrifice and offering you didn 't desire , but you prepared a body for me ;
you had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin .
then I said , ' behold , I have come ( in the scroll of the book it is written of me ) to do your will , O God . ' "
previously saying , " sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn 't desire , neither had pleasure in them " ( those which are offered according to the law ) ,
then he has said , " behold , I have come to do your will . " he takes away the first , that he may establish the second ,
by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins ,
but he , when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet .
for by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified .
the Holy Spirit also testifies to us , for after saying ,
" this is the Covenant that I will make with them : ' after those days , ' says the Lord , ' I will put my laws on their heart , I will also write them on their mind ; ' " then he says ,
" I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more . "
now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
and having a great priest over God 's house ,
let 's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and having our body washed with pure water ,
let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering ; for he who promised is faithful .
let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works ,
not forsaking our own assembling together , as the custom of some is , but exhorting one another ; and so much the more , as you see the Day approaching .
a man who disregards Moses ' law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses .
for we know him who said , " vengeance belongs to me , " says the Lord , " I will repay . " again , " The Lord will judge his people . "
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
but remember the former days , in which , after you were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings ;
partly , being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions ; and partly , becoming partakers with those who were treated so .
for you both had compassion on me in my chains , and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens .
therefore don 't throw away your boldness , which has a great reward .
for you need endurance so that , having done the will of God , you may receive the promise .
" in a very little while , he who comes will come , and will not wait .
but the righteous will live by faith . if he shrinks back , my soul has no pleasure in him . "
but we are not of those who shrink back to destruction , but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul .
now faith is assurance of things hoped for , proof of things not seen .
for by this , the elders obtained testimony .
by faith , we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him .
by faith , Abraham , when he was called , obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance . he went out , not knowing where he went .
by faith , he lived as an alien in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , dwelling in tents , with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise .
for he looked for the city which has the foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
by faith , even Sarah herself received power to conceive , and she bore a child when she was past age , since she counted him faithful who had promised .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore , were fathered by one man , and him as good as dead .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them and embraced them from afar , and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
for those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own .
if indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out , they would have had enough time to return .
but now they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . therefore God is not ashamed of them , to be called their God , for he has prepared a city for them .
by faith , Abraham , being tested , offered up Isaac . yes , he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son ;
even he to whom it was said , " In Isaac will your seed be called " ;
concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead . Figuratively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead .
by faith , Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , even concerning things to come .
by faith , Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshiped , leaning on the top of his staff .
by faith , Joseph , when his end was near , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel ; and gave instructions concerning his bones .
by faith , Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
by faith , Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter ,
choosing rather to share ill treatment with God 's people , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time ;
accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt ; for he looked to the reward .
by faith , he left Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
by faith , he kept the Passover , and the sprinkling of the blood , that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them .
by faith , they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land . when the Egyptians tried to do so , they were swallowed up .
by faith , the walls of Jericho fell down , after they had been encircled for seven days .
by faith , Rahab the prostitute , didn 't perish with those who were disobedient , having received the spies in peace .
what more shall I say ? for the time would fail me if I told of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets ;
who , through faith subdued kingdoms , worked out righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , from weakness were made strong , grew mighty in war , and caused foreign armies to flee .
women received their dead by resurrection . others were tortured , not accepting their deliverance , that they might obtain a better resurrection .
others were tried by mocking and scourging , yes , moreover by bonds and imprisonment .
they were stoned . they were sawn apart . they were tempted . they were slain with the sword . they went around in sheep skins and in goat skins ; being destitute , afflicted , ill @-@ treated
( of whom the world was not worthy ) , wandering in deserts , mountains , caves , and the holes of the earth .
these all , having had testimony given to them through their faith , didn 't receive the promise ,
God having provided some better thing concerning us , so that apart from us they should not be made perfect .
looking to Jesus , the author and perfecter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising its shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
for consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , that you don 't grow weary , fainting in your souls .
you have not yet resisted to blood , striving against sin ;
and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children , " My son , don 't take lightly the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when you are reproved by him ;
for whom the Lord loves , he chastens , and scourges every son whom he receives . "
it is for discipline that you endure . God deals with you as with children , for what son is there whom his father doesn 't discipline ?
but if you are without discipline , of which all have been made partakers , then are you illegitimate , and not children .
furthermore , we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us , and we paid them respect . shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits , and live ?
for they indeed , for a few days , punished us as seemed good to them ; but he for our profit , that we may be partakers of his holiness .
all chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous ; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby .
therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees ,
follow after peace with all men , and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord ,
looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and many be defiled by it ;
lest there be any sexually immoral person , or profane person , like Esau , who sold his birthright for one meal .
for they could not stand that which was commanded , " If even an animal touches the mountain , it shall be stoned " ;
and so fearful was the appearance , that Moses said , " I am terrified and trembling . "
whose voice shook the earth then , but now he has promised , saying , " Yet once more I will shake not only the earth , but also the heavens . "
this phrase , " Yet once more , " signifies the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that have been made , that those things which are not shaken may remain .
therefore , receiving a Kingdom that can 't be shaken , let us have grace , through which we serve God acceptably , with reverence and awe ,
for our God is a consuming fire .
let brotherly love continue .
Don 't forget to show hospitality to strangers , for in doing so , some have entertained angels without knowing it .
remember those who are in bonds , as bound with them ; and those who are ill @-@ treated , since you are also in the body .
let marriage be held in honor among all , and let the bed be undefiled : but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers .
be free from the love of money , content with such things as you have , for he has said , " I will in no way leave you , neither will I in any way forsake you . "
so that with good courage we say , " The Lord is my helper . I will not fear . what can man do to me ? "
remember your leaders , men who spoke to you the word of God , and considering the results of their conduct , imitate their faith .
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
Don 't be carried away by various and strange teachings , for it is good that the heart be established by grace , not by food , through which those who were so occupied were not benefited .
we have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat .
for the bodies of those animals , whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned outside of the camp .
therefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people through his own blood , suffered outside of the gate .
let us therefore go out to him outside of the camp , bearing his reproach .
for we don 't have here an enduring city , but we seek that which is to come .
through him , then , let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name .
but don 't forget to be doing good and sharing , for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
pray for us , for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience , desiring to live honorably in all things .
I strongly urge you to do this , that I may be restored to you sooner .
now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal Covenant , our Lord Jesus ,
make you complete in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
but I exhort you , brothers , endure the word of exhortation , for I have written to you in few words .
know that our brother Timothy has been freed , with whom , if he comes shortly , I will see you .
greet all of your leaders and all the saints . the Italians greet you .
grace be with you all . Amen .
James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are in the dispersion : greetings .
count it all joy , my brothers , when you fall into various temptations ,
knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance .
let endurance have its perfect work , that you may be perfect and complete , lacking in nothing .
but if any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all liberally and without reproach ; and it will be given to him .
but let him ask in faith , without any doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tossed .
for let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord .
but let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position ;
for the sun arises with the scorching wind , and Withers the grass , and the flower in it falls , and the beauty of its appearance perishes . so also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits .
blessed is the man who endures temptation , for when he has been approved , he will receive the crown of life , which the Lord promised to those who love him .
let no man say when he is tempted , " I am tempted by God , " for God can 't be tempted by evil , and he himself tempts no one .
but each one is tempted , when he is drawn away by his own lust , and enticed .
then the lust , when it has conceived , bears sin ; and the sin , when it is full grown , brings forth death .
Don 't be deceived , my beloved brothers .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom can be no variation , nor turning shadow .
of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth , that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures .
so , then , my beloved brothers , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , and slow to anger ;
for the anger of man doesn 't produce the righteousness of God .
therefore , putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness , receive with humility the implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
but be doers of the word , and not only hearers , deluding your own selves .
for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror ;
for he sees himself , and goes away , and immediately forgets what kind of man he was .
but he who looks into the perfect law of freedom , and continues , not being a hearer who forgets , but a doer of the work , this man will be blessed in what he does .
if anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn 't bridle his tongue , but deceives his heart , this man 's religion is worthless .
pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this : to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep oneself unstained by the world .
my brothers , don 't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality .
listen , my beloved brothers . Didn 't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith , and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him ?
but you have dishonored the poor man . Don 't the rich oppress you , and personally drag you before the courts ?
Don 't they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called ?
however , if you fulfill the royal law , according to the Scripture , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself , " you do well .
but if you show partiality , you commit sin , being convicted by the law as transgressors .
for whoever keeps the whole law , and yet stumbles in one point , he has become guilty of all .
for he who said , " Do not commit adultery , " also said , " Do not commit murder . " now if you do not commit adultery , but murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
so speak , and so do , as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom .
for judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy . mercy triumphs over judgment .
what good is it , my brothers , if a man says he has faith , but has no works ? can faith save him ?
even so faith , if it has no works , is dead in itself .
yes , a man will say , " You have faith , and I have works . " show me your faith without works , and I by my works will show you my faith .
you believe that God is one . you do well . the demons also believe , and shudder .
but do you want to know , vain man , that faith apart from works is dead ?
Wasn 't Abraham our father justified by works , in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar ?
you see that faith worked with his works , and by works faith was perfected ;
and the Scripture was fulfilled which says , " Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him as righteousness " ; and he was called the friend of God .
you see then that by works , a man is justified , and not only by faith .
in the same way , wasn 't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works , in that she received the messengers , and sent them out another way ?
for as the body apart from the spirit is dead , even so faith apart from works is dead .
let not many of you be teachers , my brothers , knowing that we will receive heavier judgment .
for in many things we all stumble . if anyone doesn 't stumble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also .
indeed , we put bits into the horses ' mouths so that they may obey us , and we guide their whole body .
behold , the ships also , though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds , are yet guided by a very small rudder , wherever the pilot desires .
so the tongue is also a little member , and boasts great things . see how a small fire can spread to a large forest !
and the tongue is a fire . the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Gehenna .
for every kind of animal , bird , creeping thing , and thing in the sea , is tamed , and has been tamed by mankind .
but nobody can tame the tongue . it is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
with it we bless our God and Father , and with it we curse men , who are made in the image of God .
out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing . my brothers , these things ought not to be so .
does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water ?
can a fig tree , my brothers , yield olives , or a vine figs ? thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water .
who is wise and understanding among you ? let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom .
but if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , don 't boast and don 't lie against the truth .
this wisdom is not that which comes down from above , but is earthly , sensual , and demonic .
for where jealousy and selfish ambition are , there is confusion and every evil deed .
but the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceful , gentle , reasonable , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace .
where do wars and fightings among you come from ? Don 't they come from your pleasures that war in your members ?
you lust , and don 't have . you kill , covet , and can 't obtain . you fight and make war . you don 't have , because you don 't ask .
you ask , and don 't receive , because you ask with wrong motives , so that you may spend it for your pleasures .
you adulterers and adulteresses , don 't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
or do you think that the Scripture says in vain , " The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously " ?
but he gives more grace . therefore it says , " God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . "
be subject therefore to God . but resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . cleanse your hands , you sinners ; and purify your hearts , you double @-@ minded .
Lament , mourn , and weep . let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to gloom .
humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he will exalt you .
Don 't speak against one another , brothers . he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . but if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law , but a judge .
only one is the lawgiver , who is able to save and to destroy . but who are you to judge another ?
but now you glory in your boasting . all such boasting is evil .
to him therefore who knows to do good , and doesn 't do it , to him it is sin .
come now , you rich , weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you .
your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth @-@ eaten .
your gold and your silver are corroded , and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . you have laid up your treasure in the last days .
behold , the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields , which you have kept back by fraud , cry out , and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Armies .
you have lived delicately on the earth , and taken your pleasure . you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter .
you have condemned , you have murdered the righteous one . he doesn 't resist you .
be patient therefore , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . behold , the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until it receives the early and late rain .
you also be patient . establish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is at hand .
Don 't grumble , brothers , against one another , so that you won 't be judged . behold , the judge stands at the door .
take , brothers , for an example of suffering and of patience , the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
is any among you suffering ? let him pray . is any cheerful ? let him sing praises .
is any among you sick ? let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ,
and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up . if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
confess your offenses to one another , and pray for one another , that you may be healed . the insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective .
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it didn 't rain on the earth for three years and six months .
he prayed again , and the sky gave rain , and the earth brought forth its fruit .
Peter , an Apostle of Jesus Christ , to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the dispersion in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
Wherein you greatly rejoice , though now for a little while , if need be , you have been put to grief in various trials ,
whom not having known you love ; in whom , though now you don 't see him , yet believing , you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory--
receiving the result of your faith , the salvation of your souls .
concerning this salvation , the prophets sought and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that would come to you ,
therefore prepare your minds for action , be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ--
as children of obedience , not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance ,
but just as he who called you is holy , you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior ;
because it is written , " You shall be holy ; for I am holy . "
if you call on him as Father , who without respect of persons judges according to each man 's work , pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear :
who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world , but was revealed at the end of times for your sake ,
who through him are believers in God , who raised him from the dead , and gave him glory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection , love one another from the heart fervently :
having been born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , through the word of God , which lives and remains forever .
for , " All flesh is like grass , and all of man 's glory like the flower in the grass . the grass Withers , and its flower falls ;
putting away therefore all wickedness , all deceit , hypocrisies , envies , and all evil speaking ,
as newborn babies , long for the pure milk of the Word , that you may grow thereby ,
if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious :
coming to him , a living stone , rejected indeed by men , but chosen by God , precious .
because it is contained in Scripture , " behold , I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone , chosen , and precious : he who believes in him will not be disappointed . "
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
who in time past were no people , but now are God 's people , who had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
beloved , I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims , to abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ;
having good behavior among the nations , so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they see , glorify God in the day of visitation .
for this is the will of God , that by well @-@ doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
as free , and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness , but as bondservants of God .
honor all men . love the brotherhood . fear God . honor the king .
servants , be in subjection to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the wicked .
for it is commendable if someone endures pain , suffering unjustly , because of conscience toward God .
for what glory is it if , when you sin , you patiently endure beating ? but if , when you do well , you patiently endure suffering , this is commendable with God .
for to this you were called , because Christ also suffered for us , leaving you an example , that you should follow his steps ,
who did not sin , " neither was deceit found in his mouth . "
who , when he was Cursed , didn 't curse back . when he suffered , didn 't threaten , but committed himself to him who judges righteously ;
who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sins , might live to righteousness ; by whose stripes you were healed .
for you were going astray like sheep ; but now have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls .
let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair , and of wearing jewels of gold , or of putting on fine clothing ;
but in the hidden person of the heart , in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God very precious .
for this is how the holy women before , who hoped in God also adorned themselves , being in subjection to their own husbands :
as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord , whose children you now are , if you do well , and are not put in fear by any terror .
finally , be all like @-@ minded , compassionate , loving as brothers , tenderhearted , courteous ,
not rendering evil for evil , or insult for insult ; but instead blessing ; knowing that to this were you called , that you may inherit a blessing .
for , " He who would love life , and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil , and his lips from speaking deceit .
let him turn away from evil , and do good . let him seek peace , and pursue it .
for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous , and his ears open to their prayer ; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil . "
now who is he who will harm you , if you become imitators of that which is good ?
but even if you should suffer for righteousness ' sake , you are blessed . " Don 't fear what they fear , neither be troubled . "
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear :
for it is better , if it is God 's will , that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil .
in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison ,
who is at the right hand of God , having gone into heaven , angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him .
Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same mind ; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ;
that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men , but for the will of God .
they think it is strange that you don 't run with them into the same excess of riot , blaspheming :
who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
for to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead , that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh , but live as to God in the spirit .
but the end of all things is near . therefore be of sound mind , self @-@ controlled , and sober in prayer .
and above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves , for love covers a multitude of sins .
be hospitable to one another without grumbling .
as each has received a gift , employ it in serving one another , as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms .
beloved , don 't be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you , to test you , as though a strange thing happened to you .
but because you are partakers of Christ 's sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy .
if you are insulted for the name of Christ , you are blessed ; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you . on their part he is blasphemed , but on your part he is glorified .
for let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil doer , or a meddler in other men 's matters .
but if one of you suffers for being a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God in this matter .
for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God . if it begins first with us , what will happen to those who don 't obey the Good News of God ?
" if it is hard for the righteous to be saved , what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner ? "
therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him , as to a faithful Creator .
when the chief shepherd is revealed , you will receive the crown of glory that doesn 't fade away .
likewise , you younger ones , be subject to the elder . yes , all of you clothe yourselves with humility , to subject yourselves to one another ; for " God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . "
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time ;
casting all your worries on him , because he cares for you .
be sober and self @-@ controlled . be watchful . your adversary , the devil , walks around like a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour .
withstand him steadfast in your faith , knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings .
but may the God of all grace , who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after you have suffered a little while , perfect , establish , strengthen , and settle you .
to him be the glory and the power forever and ever . Amen .
she who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , greets you ; and so does Mark , my son .
greet one another with a kiss of love . peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
Simon Peter , a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord ,
seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness , through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue ;
yes , and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence , in your faith supply moral excellence ; and in moral excellence , knowledge ;
for if these things are yours and abound , they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
for he who lacks these things is blind , seeing only what is near , having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins .
therefore , brothers , be more diligent to make your calling and election sure . for if you do these things , you will never stumble .
for thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ .
therefore I will not be negligent to remind you of these things , though you know them , and are established in the present truth .
I think it right , as long as I am in this tent , to stir you up by reminding you ;
knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly , even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me .
yes , I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure .
for we did not follow cunningly devised fables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
we heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain .
knowing this first , that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation .
for no prophecy ever came by the will of man : but holy men of God spoke , being moved by the Holy Spirit .
many will follow their immoral ways , and as a result , the way of the truth will be maligned .
in covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words : whose sentence now from of old doesn 't linger , and their destruction will not slumber .
for if God didn 't spare angels when they sinned , but cast them down to Tartarus , and committed them to pits of darkness , to be reserved for judgment ;
and didn 't spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah with seven others , a preacher of righteousness , when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly ;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them to destruction , having made them an example to those who would live ungodly ;
and delivered righteous lot , who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked
( for that righteous man dwelling among them , was tormented in his righteous soul from day to day with seeing and hearing lawless deeds ) :
whereas angels , though greater in might and power , don 't bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord .
having eyes full of adultery , and who can 't cease from sin ; enticing unsettled souls ; having a heart trained in greed ; children of cursing ;
forsaking the right way , they went astray , having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages of wrongdoing ;
but he was rebuked for his own disobedience . a mute donkey spoke with a man 's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet .
these are wells without water , clouds driven by a storm ; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever .
for , uttering great swelling words of emptiness , they entice in the lusts of the flesh , by licentiousness , those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error ;
promising them liberty , while they themselves are bondservants of corruption ; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him .
for if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
but it has happened to them according to the true proverb , " The dog turns to his own vomit again , " and " the sow that has washed to wallowing in the mire . "
this is now , beloved , the second letter that I have written to you ; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you ;
that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and the commandments of us , the Apostles of the Lord and Savior :
for this they willfully forget , that there were heavens from of old , and an earth formed out of water and amid water , by the word of God ;
by which means the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished .
but the heavens that now are , and the earth , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
but don 't forget this one thing , beloved , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
the Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slowness ; but is patient with us , not wishing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
but , according to his promise , we look for new heavens and a new earth , in which righteousness dwells .
therefore , beloved , seeing that you look for these things , be diligent to be found in peace , without blemish and blameless in his sight .
regard the patience of our Lord as salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also , according to the wisdom given to him , wrote to you ;
you therefore , beloved , knowing these things beforehand , beware , lest being carried away with the error of the wicked , you fall from your own steadfastness .
but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . to him be the glory both now and forever . Amen .
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Word of life
( and the life was revealed , and we have seen , and testify , and declare to you the life , the eternal life , which was with the Father , and was revealed to us ) ;
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fellowship with us . yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
and we write these things to you , that our joy may be fulfilled .
this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness , we lie , and don 't tell the truth .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ , his Son , cleanses us from all sin .
if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
if we confess our sins , he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
if we say that we haven 't sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
my little children , I write these things to you so that you may not sin . if anyone sins , we have a counselor with the Father , Jesus Christ , the righteous .
and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins , and not for ours only , but also for the whole world .
this is how we know that we know him : if we keep his commandments .
one who says , " I know him , " and doesn 't keep his commandments , is a liar , and the truth isn 't in him .
but whoever keeps his word , God 's love has most certainly been perfected in him . this is how we know that we are in him :
he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked .
brothers , I write no new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you had from the beginning . the old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning .
again , I write a new commandment to you , which is true in him and in you ; because the darkness is passing away , and the true light already shines .
he who says he is in the light and hates his brother , is in the darkness even until now .
he who loves his brother remains in the light , and there is no occasion for stumbling in him .
but he who hates his brother is in the darkness , and walks in the darkness , and doesn 't know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
I write to you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
I write to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you have overcome the evil one . I write to you , little children , because you know the Father .
I have written to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
Don 't love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone loves the world , the Father 's love isn 't in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , isn 't the Father 's , but is the world 's .
the world is passing away with its lusts , but he who does God 's will remains forever .
little children , these are the end times , and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have arisen . by this we know that it is the final hour .
they went out from us , but they didn 't belong to us ; for if they had belonged to us , they would have continued with us . but they left , that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us .
you have an anointing from the Holy One , and you all have knowledge .
I have not written to you because you don 't know the truth , but because you know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? this is the Antichrist , he who denies the Father and the Son .
whoever denies the Son , the same doesn 't have the Father . he who confesses the Son has the Father also .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the Father .
this is the promise which he promised us , the eternal life .
these things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray .
now , little children , remain in him , that when he appears , we may have boldness , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
if you know that he is righteous , you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him .
behold , how great a love the Father has bestowed on us , that we should be called children of God ! for this cause the world doesn 't know us , because it didn 't know him .
beloved , now we are children of God , and it is not yet revealed what we will be . but we know that , when he is revealed , we will be like him ; for we will see him just as he is .
everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself , even as he is pure .
everyone who sins also commits lawlessness . sin is lawlessness .
you know that he was revealed to take away our sins , and in him is no sin .
whoever remains in him doesn 't sin . whoever sins hasn 't seen him , neither knows him .
little children , let no one lead you astray . he who does righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous .
he who sins is of the devil , for the devil has been sinning from the beginning . to this end the Son of God was revealed , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
whoever is born of God doesn 't commit sin , because his seed remains in him ; and he can 't sin , because he is born of God .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the devil . whoever doesn 't do righteousness is not of God , neither is he who doesn 't love his brother .
for this is the message which you heard from the beginning , that we should love one another ;
unlike Cain , who was of the evil one , and killed his brother . why did he kill him ? because his works were evil , and his brother 's righteous .
Don 't be surprised , my brothers , if the world hates you .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who doesn 't love his brother remains in death .
whoever hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him .
by this we know love , because he laid down his life for us . and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers .
but whoever has the world 's goods , and sees his brother in need , and closes his heart of compassion against him , how does the love of God remain in him ?
my little children , let 's not love in word only , neither with the tongue only , but in deed and truth .
this is his commandment , that we should believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love one another , even as he commanded .
he who keeps his commandments remains in him , and he in him . by this we know that he remains in us , by the Spirit which he gave us .
beloved , don 't believe every spirit , but test the spirits , whether they are of God , because many false prophets have gone out into the world .
by this you know the Spirit of God : every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God ,
and every spirit who doesn 't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God , and this is the spirit of the Antichrist , of whom you have heard that it comes . now it is in the world already .
you are of God , little children , and have overcome them ; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world .
they are of the world . therefore they speak of the world , and the world hears them .
we are of God . he who knows God listens to us . he who is not of God doesn 't listen to us . by this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
beloved , let us love one another , for love is of God ; and everyone who loves is born of God , and knows God .
he who doesn 't love doesn 't know God , for God is love .
by this God 's love was revealed in us , that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him .
in this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins .
beloved , if God loved us in this way , we also ought to love one another .
no one has seen God at any time . if we love one another , God remains in us , and his love has been perfected in us .
by this we know that we remain in him and he in us , because he has given us of his Spirit .
we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world .
whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God , God remains in him , and he in God .
we know and have believed the love which God has for us . God is love , and he who remains in love remains in God , and God remains in him .
in this love has been made perfect among us , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment , because as he is , even so are we in this world .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love casts out fear , because fear has punishment . he who fears is not made perfect in love .
we love him , because he first loved us .
if a man says , " I love God , " and hates his brother , he is a liar ; for he who doesn 't love his brother whom he has seen , how can he love God whom he has not seen ?
this commandment we have from him , that he who loves God should also love his brother .
whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God . whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him .
by this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and keep his commandments .
for this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments . his commandments are not grievous .
for whatever is born of God overcomes the world . this is the victory that has overcome the world : your faith .
who is he who overcomes the world , but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
this is he who came by water and blood , Jesus Christ ; not with the water only , but with the water and the blood . it is the Spirit who testifies , because the Spirit is the truth .
for there are three who testify :
if we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater ; for this is God 's testimony which he has testified concerning his Son .
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who doesn 't believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
the testimony is this , that God gave to us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
he who has the Son has the life . he who doesn 't have God 's Son doesn 't have the life .
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eternal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
this is the boldness which we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he listens to us .
and if we know that he listens to us , whatever we ask , we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him .
all unrighteousness is sin , and there is a sin not leading to death .
we know that whoever is born of God doesn 't sin , but he who was born of God keeps himself , and the evil one doesn 't touch him .
we know that we are of God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
we know that the Son of God has come , and has given us an understanding , that we know him who is true , and we are in him who is true , in his Son Jesus Christ . this is the true God , and eternal life .
little children , keep yourselves from idols .
the elder , to the chosen lady and her children , whom I love in truth ; and not I only , but also all those who know the truth ;
for the truth 's sake , which remains in us , and it will be with us forever :
grace , mercy , and peace will be with us , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth , even as we have been commanded by the Father .
now I beg you , dear lady , not as though I wrote to you a new commandment , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
this is love , that we should walk according to his commandments . this is the commandment , even as you heard from the beginning , that you should walk in it .
for many deceivers have gone out into the world , those who don 't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh . this is the deceiver and the Antichrist .
watch yourselves , that we don 't lose the things which we have accomplished , but that we receive a full reward .
whoever transgresses and doesn 't remain in the teaching of Christ , doesn 't have God . he who remains in the teaching , the same has both the Father and the Son .
if anyone comes to you , and doesn 't bring this teaching , don 't receive him into your house , and don 't welcome him ,
for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works .
having many things to write to you , I don 't want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that our joy may be made full .
the children of your chosen sister greet you . Amen .
the elder to Gaius the beloved , whom I love in truth .
beloved , I pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy , even as your soul prospers .
for I rejoiced greatly , when brothers came and testified about your truth , even as you walk in truth .
I have no greater joy than this , to hear about my children walking in truth .
beloved , you do a faithful work in whatever you accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers .
they have testified about your love before the assembly . you will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way worthy of God ,
because for the sake of the Name they went out , taking nothing from the Gentiles .
we therefore ought to receive such , that we may be fellow workers for the truth .
I wrote to the assembly , but Diotrephes , who loves to be first among them , doesn 't accept what we say .
beloved , don 't imitate that which is evil , but that which is good . he who does good is of God . he who does evil hasn 't seen God .
Demetrius has the testimony of all , and of the truth itself ; yes , we also testify , and you know that our testimony is true .
I had many things to write to you , but I am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen ;
but I hope to see you soon , and we will speak face to face . peace be to you . the friends greet you . greet the friends by name .
Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to those who are called , sanctified by God the Father , and kept for Jesus Christ :
mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied .
now I desire to remind you , though you already know this , that the Lord , having saved a people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who didn 't believe .
angels who didn 't keep their first domain , but deserted their own dwelling place , he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day .
yet in the same way , these also in their dreaming defile the flesh , despise authority , and slander celestial beings .
but Michael , the Archangel , when contending with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses , dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation , but said , " May the Lord rebuke you ! "
but these speak evil of whatever things they don 't know . what they understand naturally , like the creatures without reason , they are destroyed in these things .
Woe to them ! for they went in the way of Cain , and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire , and perished in Korah 's rebellion .
wild waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever .
these are murmurers and complainers , walking after their lusts ( and their mouth speaks proud things ) , showing respect of persons to gain advantage .
but you , beloved , remember the words which have been spoken before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
they said to you that " In the last time there will be mockers , walking after their own ungodly lusts . "
these are they who cause divisions , and are sensual , not having the Spirit .
but you , beloved , keep building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Spirit .
keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life .
on some have compassion , making a distinction ,
and some save , snatching them out of the fire with fear , hating even the clothing stained by the flesh .
this is the revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon , which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant , John ,
who testified to God 's word , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , about everything that he saw .
blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy , and keep the things that are written in it , for the time is at hand .
behold , he is coming with the clouds , and every eye will see him , including those who pierced him . all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him . even so , Amen .
" I am the Alpha and the Omega , " says the Lord God , " who is and who was and who is to come , the Almighty . "
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and I heard behind me a loud voice , like a trumpet
saying , " What you see , write in a book and send to the seven assemblies : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and to Laodicea . "
his head and his hair were white as white wool , like snow . his eyes were like a flame of fire .
his feet were like burnished brass , as if it had been refined in a furnace . his voice was like the voice of many waters .
he had seven stars in his right hand . out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two @-@ edged sword . his face was like the sun shining at its brightest .
when I saw him , I fell at his feet like a dead man . he laid his right hand on me , saying , " Don 't be afraid . I am the first and the last ,
and the Living one . I was dead , and behold , I am alive forevermore . Amen . I have the keys of Death and of Hades .
write therefore the things which you have seen , and the things which are , and the things which will happen hereafter ;
the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand , and the seven golden lampstands . the seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies . the seven lampstands are seven assemblies .
" to the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write : " he who holds the seven stars in his right hand , he who walks among the seven golden lampstands says these things :
you have perseverance and have endured for my name 's sake , and have not grown weary .
but I have this against you , that you left your first love .
remember therefore from where you have fallen , and repent and do the first works ; or else I am coming to you swiftly , and will move your lampstand out of its place , unless you repent .
but this you have , that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . to him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Paradise of my God .
" to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write : " the first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life says these things :
" I know your works , oppression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . he who overcomes won 't be harmed by the second death .
" to the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write : " he who has the sharp two @-@ edged sword says these things :
so you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans likewise .
repent therefore , or else I am coming to you quickly , and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth .
" to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write : " the Son of God , who has his eyes like a flame of fire , and his feet are like burnished brass , says these things :
" I know your works , your love , faith , service , patient endurance , and that your last works are more than the first .
I gave her time to repent , but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality .
behold , I will throw her into a bed , and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression , unless they repent of her works .
I will kill her children with Death , and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts . I will give to each one of you according to your deeds .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies .
" and to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write : " he who has the seven spirits of God , and the seven stars says these things : " I know your works , that you have a reputation of being alive , but you are dead .
wake up , and keep the things that remain , which you were about to throw away , for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God .
nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments . they will walk with me in white , for they are worthy .
he who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments , and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life , and I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies .
" to the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write : " he who is holy , he who is true , he who has the key of David , he who opens and no one can shut , and who shuts and no one opens , says these things :
" I know your works ( behold , I have set before you an open door , which no one can shut ) , that you have a little power , and kept my word , and didn 't deny my name .
behold , I give of the synagogue of Satan , of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but lie . behold , I will make them to come and worship before your feet , and to know that I have loved you .
because you kept my command to endure , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
I am coming quickly ! hold firmly that which you have , so that no one takes your crown .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies .
" to the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write : " the Amen , the faithful and True Witness , the Head of God 's creation , says these things :
" I know your works , that you are neither cold nor hot . I wish you were cold or hot .
so , because you are lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I will vomit you out of my mouth .
because you say , ' I am rich , and have gotten riches , and have need of nothing ; ' and don 't know that you are the wretched one , miserable , poor , blind , and naked ;
as many as I love , I reprove and chasten . be zealous therefore , and repent .
behold , I stand at the door and knock . if anyone hears my voice and opens the door , then I will come in to him , and will dine with him , and he with me .
he who overcomes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne , as I also overcame , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . "
immediately I was in the Spirit . behold , there was a throne set in heaven , and one sitting on the throne
that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius . there was a rainbow around the throne , like an Emerald to look at .
around the throne were twenty @-@ four thrones . on the thrones were twenty @-@ four elders sitting , dressed in white garments , with crowns of gold on their heads .
out of the throne proceed lightnings , sounds , and thunders . there were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne , which are the seven spirits of God .
before the throne was something like a sea of glass , similar to crystal . in the midst of the throne , and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind .
the first creature was like a lion , and the second creature like a calf , and the third creature had a face like a man , and the fourth was like a flying eagle .
I saw , in the right hand of him who sat on the throne , a book written inside and outside , sealed shut with seven seals .
I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice , " Who is worthy to open the book , and to break its seals ? "
no one in heaven above , or on the earth , or under the earth , was able to open the book , or to look in it .
and I wept much , because no one was found worthy to open the book , or to look in it .
I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a lamb standing , as though it had been slain , having seven horns , and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God , sent out into all the earth .
then he came , and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne .
now when he had taken the book , the four living creatures and the twenty @-@ four elders fell down before the lamb , each one having a harp , and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
and made us kings and priests to our God , and we will reign on earth . "
I saw , and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne , the living creatures , and the elders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
saying with a loud voice , " worthy is the lamb who has been killed to receive the power , wealth , wisdom , strength , honor , glory , and blessing ! "
the four living creatures said , " Amen ! " the elders fell down and worshiped .
I saw that the lamb opened one of the seven seals , and I heard one of the four living creatures saying , as with a voice of Thunder , " Come and see ! "
and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it had a bow . a crown was given to him , and he came forth conquering , and to conquer .
when he opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature saying , " Come ! "
when he opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature saying , " Come and see ! " and behold , a black horse , and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand .
I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , " A choenix of wheat for a denarius , and three choenix of barley for a denarius ! Don 't damage the oil and the wine ! "
when he opened the fourth seal , I heard the fourth living creature saying , " Come and see ! "
when he opened the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God , and for the testimony of the lamb which they had .
a long white robe was given to each of them . they were told that they should rest yet for a while , until their fellow servants and their brothers , who would also be killed even as they were , should complete their course .
I saw when he opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair , and the whole moon became as blood .
the stars of the sky fell to the earth , like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind .
the sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up . every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
the kings of the earth , the princes , the commanding officers , the rich , the strong , and every slave and free person , hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains .
they told the mountains and the rocks , " Fall on us , and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne , and from the wrath of the lamb ,
for the great day of his wrath has come ; and who is able to stand ? "
after this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise , having the seal of the living God . he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea ,
saying , " Don 't harm the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads ! "
I heard the number of those who were sealed , one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel :
of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand , of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand , of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand ,
of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand , of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand , of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand ,
of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand , of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand , of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand ,
of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand , of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand , of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
they cried with a loud voice , saying , " salvation be to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the lamb ! "
all the angels were standing around the throne , the elders , and the four living creatures ; and they fell on their faces before his throne , and worshiped God ,
saying , " Amen ! blessing , glory , wisdom , Thanksgiving , honor , power , and might , be to our God forever and ever ! Amen . "
one of the elders answered , saying to me , " These who are arrayed in white robes , who are they , and from where did they come ? "
I told him , " My lord , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tribulation . they washed their robes , and made them white in the lamb 's blood .
therefore they are before the throne of God , they serve him day and night in his temple . he who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them .
they will never be hungry , neither thirsty any more ; neither will the sun beat on them , nor any heat ;
for the lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them , and leads them to springs of waters of life . and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
when he opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
the smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the saints , went up before God out of the angel 's hand .
the angel took the censer , and he filled it with the fire of the altar , and threw it on the earth . there followed thunders , sounds , lightnings , and an earthquake .
the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
the first sounded , and there followed hail and fire , mixed with blood , and they were thrown to the earth . one third of the earth was burnt up , and one third of the trees were burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
the second angel sounded , and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea . one third of the sea became blood ,
and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died . one third of the ships were destroyed .
the third angel sounded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the springs of the waters .
the name of the star is called " Wormwood . " one third of the waters became wormwood . many people died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth . the key to the pit of the abyss was given to him .
he opened the pit of the abyss , and smoke went up out of the pit , like the smoke from a burning furnace . the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit .
then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth , and power was given to them , as the Scorpions of the earth have power .
they were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree , but only those people who don 't have God 's seal on their foreheads .
they were given power not to kill them , but to torment them for five months . their torment was like the torment of a scorpion , when it strikes a person .
in those days people will seek death , and will in no way find it . they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war . on their heads were something like golden crowns , and their faces were like people 's faces .
they had hair like women 's hair , and their teeth were like those of lions .
they had breastplates , like breastplates of iron . the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots , or of many horses rushing to war .
they have tails like those of Scorpions , and stings . in their tails they have power to harm men for five months .
they have over them as king the angel of the abyss . his name in Hebrew is " Abaddon , " but in Greek , he has the name " Apollyon . "
the sixth angel sounded . I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet , " Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates ! "
the four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year , so that they might kill one third of mankind .
the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million . I heard the number of them .
thus I saw the horses in the vision , and those who sat on them , having breastplates of fiery red , hyacinth blue , and sulfur yellow ; and the heads of lions . out of their mouths proceed fire , smoke , and sulfur .
by these three plagues were one third of mankind killed : by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur , which proceeded out of their mouths .
for the power of the horses is in their mouths , and in their tails . for their tails are like Serpents , and have heads , and with them they harm .
they didn 't repent of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their sexual immorality , nor of their thefts .
I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky , clothed with a cloud . a rainbow was on his head . his face was like the sun , and his feet like pillars of fire .
when the seven thunders sounded , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from the sky saying , " Seal up the things which the seven thunders said , and don 't write them . "
the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky ,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the prophets .
the voice which I heard from heaven , again speaking with me , said , " Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as sweet as honey in my mouth . when I had eaten it , my stomach was made bitter .
they told me , " You must prophesy again over many peoples , nations , languages , and kings . "
a Reed like a rod was given to me . someone said , " Rise , and measure God 's temple , and the altar , and those who worship in it .
leave out the court which is outside of the temple , and don 't measure it , for it has been given to the nations . they will tread the holy city under foot for forty @-@ two months .
I will give power to my two witnesses , and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days , clothed in sackcloth . "
these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands , standing before the Lord of the earth .
if anyone desires to harm them , fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies . if anyone desires to harm them , he must be killed in this way .
when they have finished their testimony , the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them , and overcome them , and kill them .
their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
from among the peoples , tribes , languages , and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them , and they will be glad . they will give gifts to one another , because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth .
after the three and a half days , the breath of life from God entered into them , and they stood on their feet . great fear fell on those who saw them .
I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , " Come up here ! " they went up into heaven in the cloud , and their enemies saw them .
in that day there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell . seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were terrified , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
the second woe is past . behold , the third woe comes quickly .
the seventh angel sounded , and great voices in heaven followed , saying , " The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ . he will reign forever and ever ! "
a great sign was seen in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and on her head a crown of twelve stars .
she was with child . she cried out in pain , laboring to give birth .
another sign was seen in heaven . behold , a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and on his heads seven crowns .
his tail drew one third of the stars of the sky , and threw them to the earth . the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might devour her child .
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his throne .
the woman fled into the wilderness , where she has a place prepared by God , that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days .
there was war in the sky . Michael and his angels made war on the dragon . the dragon and his angels made war .
the great dragon was thrown down , the old serpent , he who is called the devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
they overcame him because of the lamb 's blood , and because of the word of their testimony . they didn 't love their life , even to death .
therefore rejoice , heavens , and you who dwell in them . Woe to the earth and to the sea , because the devil has gone down to you , having great wrath , knowing that he has but a short time . "
when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman , that she might fly into the wilderness to her place , so that she might be nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
the serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river , that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream .
the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth .
the dragon grew angry with the woman , and went away to make war with the rest of her seed , who keep God 's commandments and hold Jesus ' testimony .
then I stood on the sand of the sea . I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads . on his horns were ten crowns , and on his heads , blasphemous names .
the beast which I saw was like a Leopard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . the dragon gave him his power , his throne , and great authority .
one of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally . his fatal wound was healed , and the whole earth marveled at the beast .
they worshiped the dragon , because he gave his authority to the beast , and they worshiped the beast , saying , " Who is like the beast ? who is able to make war with him ? "
a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him . authority to make war for forty @-@ two months was given to him .
he opened his mouth for blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name , and his dwelling , those who dwell in heaven .
it was given to him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them . authority over every tribe , people , language , and nation was given to him .
all who dwell on the earth will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb who has been killed .
if anyone has an ear , let him hear .
if anyone is to go into captivity , he will go into captivity . if anyone is to be killed with the sword , he must be killed . here is the endurance and the faith of the saints .
I saw another beast coming up out of the earth . he had two horns like a lamb , and he spoke like a dragon .
he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence . he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
he performs great signs , even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people .
it was given to him to give breath to it , to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause as many as wouldn 't worship the image of the beast to be killed .
he causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the slave , to be given marks on their right hands , or on their foreheads ;
and that no one would be able to buy or to sell , unless he has that mark , the name of the beast or the number of his name .
here is wisdom . he who has understanding , let him calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man . his number is six hundred sixty @-@ six .
I saw , and behold , the lamb standing on Mount Zion , and with him a number , one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his Father , written on their foreheads .
I heard a sound from heaven , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great Thunder . the sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps .
in their mouth was found no lie , for they are blameless .
he said with a loud voice , " Fear the Lord , and give him glory ; for the hour of his judgment has come . worship him who made the heaven , the earth , the sea , and the springs of waters ! "
another , a second angel , followed , saying , " Babylon the great has fallen , which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality . "
the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name .
here is the patience of the saints , those who keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus . "
I looked , and behold , a white cloud ; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
another angel came out from the temple , crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud , " Send forth your sickle , and reap ; for the hour to reap has come ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe ! "
he who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth , and the earth was reaped .
another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven . he also had a sharp sickle .
the winepress was trodden outside of the city , and blood came out from the winepress , even to the bridles of the horses , as far as one thousand six hundred stadia .
I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky : seven angels having the seven last plagues , for in them God 's wrath is finished .
after these things I looked , and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened .
the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out , clothed with pure , bright linen , and wearing golden sashes around their breasts .
one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temple , until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished .
I heard a loud voice out of the temple , saying to the seven angels , " Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth ! "
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshiped his image .
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water , and they became blood .
I heard the angel of the waters saying , " You are righteous , who are and who were , you Holy One , because you have judged these things .
for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets , and you have given them blood to drink . they deserve this . "
I heard the altar saying , " Yes , Lord God , the Almighty , true and righteous are your judgments . "
the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was given to him to scorch men with fire .
people were scorched with great heat , and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues . they didn 't repent and give him glory .
the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was darkened . they gnawed their tongues because of the pain ,
and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores . they didn 't repent of their works .
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , something like frogs ;
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
" behold , I come like a thief . blessed is he who watches , and keeps his clothes , so that he doesn 't walk naked , and they see his shame . "
he gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew , Megiddo .
the seventh poured out his bowl into the air . a loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , " It is done ! "
there were lightnings , sounds , and thunders ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since there were men on the earth , so great an earthquake , so mighty .
the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God , to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me , saying , " Come here . I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters ,
with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality , and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality . "
the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth .
and on her forehead a name was written , " mystery , BABYLON the great , the mother of the prostitutes and of the ABOMINATIONS of the Earth . "
I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . when I saw her , I wondered with great amazement .
the angel said to me , " Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
here is the mind that has wisdom . the seven heads are seven mountains , on which the woman sits .
they are seven kings . five have fallen , the one is , the other has not yet come . when he comes , he must continue a little while .
the beast that was , and is not , is himself also an eighth , and is of the seven ; and he goes to destruction .
the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet , but they receive authority as kings , with the beast , for one hour .
these have one mind , and they give their power and authority to the beast .
these will war against the lamb , and the lamb will overcome them , for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings . they also will overcome who are with him , called and chosen and faithful . "
he said to me , " The waters which you saw , where the prostitute sits , are peoples , multitudes , nations , and languages .
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the prostitute , and will make her desolate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
the woman whom you saw is the great city , which reigns over the kings of the earth . "
after these things , I saw another angel coming down out of the sky , having great authority . the earth was illuminated with his glory .
he cried with a mighty voice , saying , " fallen , fallen is Babylon the great , and she has become a habitation of demons , a prison of every unclean spirit , and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird !
for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality , the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury . "
I heard another voice from heaven , saying , " Come out of her , my people , that you have no participation in her sins , and that you don 't receive of her plagues ,
for her sins have reached to the sky , and God has remembered her iniquities .
return to her just as she returned , and repay her double as she did , and according to her works . in the cup which she mixed , mix to her double .
therefore in one day her plagues will come : death , mourning , and famine ; and she will be utterly burned with fire ; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong .
the kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her , will weep and wail over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
standing far away for the fear of her torment , saying , ' Woe , woe , the great city , Babylon , the strong city ! for your judgment has come in one hour . '
the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her , for no one buys their merchandise any more ;
the fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you , and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you , and you will find them no more at all .
the merchants of these things , who were made rich by her , will stand far away for the fear of her torment , weeping and mourning ;
saying , ' Woe , woe , the great city , she who was dressed in fine linen , purple , and scarlet , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls !
" rejoice over her , O heaven , you saints , Apostles , and prophets ; for God has judged your judgment on her . "
a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea , saying , " Thus with violence will Babylon , the great city , be thrown down , and will be found no more at all .
the light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you . the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you ; for your merchants were the princes of the earth ; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived .
in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints , and of all who have been slain on the earth . "
after these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven , saying , " Hallelujah ! salvation , power , and glory belong to our God :
for true and righteous are his judgments . for he has judged the great prostitute , who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality , and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
a second said , " Hallelujah ! her smoke goes up forever and ever . "
the twenty @-@ four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne , saying , " Amen ! Hallelujah ! "
a voice came forth from the throne , saying , " Give praise to our God , all you his servants , you who fear him , the small and the great ! "
let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad , and let us give the glory to him . for the marriage of the lamb has come , and his wife has made herself ready . "
it was given to her that she would array herself in bright , pure , fine linen : for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints .
he said to me , " Write , ' blessed are those who are invited to the marriage Supper of the lamb . ' " he said to me , " These are true words of God . "
I saw the heaven opened , and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it is called faithful and True . in righteousness he judges and makes war .
his eyes are a flame of fire , and on his head are many crowns . he has names written and a name written which no one knows but he himself .
he is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood . his name is called " The Word of God . "
the armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses , clothed in white , pure , fine linen .
he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written , " King of Kings , and Lord of lords . "
I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse , and against his army .
the rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse , the sword which came forth out of his mouth . all the birds were filled with their flesh .
I saw an angel coming down out of heaven , having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand .
he seized the dragon , the old serpent , which is the devil and Satan , who deceives the whole inhabited earth , and bound him for a thousand years ,
the rest of the dead didn 't live until the thousand years were finished . this is the first resurrection .
blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection . over these , the second death has no power , but they will be priests of God and of Christ , and will reign with him one thousand years .
and after the thousand years , Satan will be released from his prison ,
and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to the war ; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
they went up over the breadth of the earth , and surrounded the camp of the saints , and the beloved city . fire came down out of heaven from God , and devoured them .
the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet are also . they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
I saw a great white throne , and him who sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away . there was found no place for them .
I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the throne , and they opened books . another book was opened , which is the book of life . the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books , according to their works .
the sea gave up the dead who were in it . death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them . they were judged , each one according to his works .
death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . this is the second death , the lake of fire .
if anyone was not found written in the book of life , he was cast into the lake of fire .
I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away , and the sea is no more .
I saw the holy city , New Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God , prepared like a bride adorned for her husband .
he will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes . death will be no more ; neither will there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain , any more . the first things have passed away . "
he who sits on the throne said , " behold , I am making all things new . " he said , " Write , for these words of God are faithful and true . "
he said to me , " It is done ! I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . I will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life .
he who overcomes , I will give him these things . I will be his God , and he will be my son .
but for the cowardly , unbelieving , sinners , abominable , murderers , sexually immoral , sorcerers , idolaters , and all liars , their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur , which is the second death . "
one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls , who were loaded with the seven last plagues came , and he spoke with me , saying , " Come here . I will show you the wife , the lamb 's bride . "
having a great and high wall ; having twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels ; and names written on them , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel .
on the east were three gates ; and on the north three gates ; and on the south three gates ; and on the west three gates .
the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the lamb .
he who spoke with me had for a measure , a golden Reed , to measure the city , its gates , and its walls .
the city lies foursquare , and its length is as great as its breadth . he measured the city with the Reed , Twelve thousand twelve stadia . its length , breadth , and height are equal .
its wall is one hundred forty @-@ four cubits , by the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
the construction of its wall was jasper . the city was pure gold , like pure glass .
the twelve gates were twelve pearls . each one of the gates was made of one pearl . the street of the city was pure gold , like transparent glass .
I saw no temple in it , for the Lord God , the Almighty , and the lamb , are its temple .
the city has no need for the sun , neither of the moon , to shine , for the very glory of God illuminated it , and its lamp is the lamb .
the nations will walk in its light . the kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it .
its gates will in no way be shut by day ( for there will be no night there ) ,
and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter .
there will in no way enter into it anything profane , or one who causes an abomination or a lie , but only those who are written in the lamb 's book of life .
he showed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb ,
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
there will be no curse any more . the throne of God and of the lamb will be in it , and his servants serve him .
they will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads .
there will be no night , and they need no lamp light ; for the Lord God will illuminate them . they will reign forever and ever .
he said to me , " These words are faithful and true . the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bondservants the things which must happen soon . "
" behold , I come quickly . blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book . "
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things .
he said to me , " See you don 't do it ! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers , the prophets , and with those who keep the words of this book . worship God . "
he said to me , " Don 't seal up the words of the prophecy of this book , for the time is at hand .
he who acts unjustly , let him act unjustly still . he who is filthy , let him be filthy still . he who is righteous , let him do righteousness still . he who is holy , let him be holy still . "
" behold , I come quickly . my reward is with me , to repay to each man according to his work .
I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End .
blessed are those who do his commandments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
outside are the dogs , the sorcerers , the sexually immoral , the murderers , the idolaters , and everyone who loves and practices falsehood .
I , Jesus , have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies . I am the root and the offspring of David ; the bright and Morning Star . "
the Spirit and the bride say , " Come ! " he who hears , let him say , " Come ! " he who is thirsty , let him come . he who desires , let him take the water of life freely .
I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book , if anyone adds to them , may God add to him the plagues which are written in this book .
if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy , may God take away his part from the tree of life , and out of the holy city , which are written in this book .
he who testifies these things says , " Yes , I come quickly . " Amen ! yes , come , Lord Jesus .
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints . Amen .
