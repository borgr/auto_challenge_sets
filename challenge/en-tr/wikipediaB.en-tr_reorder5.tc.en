in October 1835 at the age of 17 , Marx travelled to the University of Bonn wishing to study philosophy and literature : however , his father insisted on law as a more practical field .
Marx also joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society ( " Landsmannschaft der Treveraner " ) , at one point serving as club co @-@ president .
such an uprising , as that recommended by the Schapper / Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe .
the " New York Daily Tribune " had been founded in New York City in the United States of America by Horace Greeley in April 1841 .
Marx 's first article for the " New York Tribune " was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the " Tribune " on 21 August 1852 .
however , with the slavery crisis coming to a head in the late 1850s and with the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 , the American public 's interest in European affairs declined .
they both became sure that their economic view of the course of history was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained .
the question of whether a recession would be necessary to create a new revolutionary situation in society became a point of contention between Marx and certain other revolutionaries .
however , in the same letter to Vera Zasulich , Marx points out that " at the core of the capitalist system ... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production .
before he died , Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas , which were published in 1884 under the title " The Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State . "

the influence of these genes is mediated , to varying degrees , by the environment an organism has experienced .
DNA is composed of a chain of nucleotides , of which there are four types : adenine ( A ) , cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) , and thymine ( T ) .
these DNA strands are often extremely long ; the largest human chromosome , for example , is about 247 million base pairs in length .
proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules , sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within the bound molecules ( without changing the structure of the protein itself ) .
the phenotype of an organism depends on the interaction of genes and the environment .
the presence of tryptophan directly affects the activity of the genes - tryptophan molecules bind to the tryptophan repressor ( a transcription factor ) , changing the repressor 's structure such that the repressor binds to the genes .
all the cells in a multicellular organism derive from a single cell , differentiating into variant cell types in response to external and intercellular signals and gradually establishing different patterns of gene expression to create different behaviors .
common research topics in model organism genetics include the study of gene regulation and the involvement of genes in development and cancer .
when searching for an unknown gene that may be involved in a disease , researchers commonly use genetic linkage and genetic pedigree charts to find the location on the genome associated with the disease .

this dynamically induced electric field has closed field lines just as the magnetic field , if not superposed by a static ( charge induced ) electric field .
this aspect of electromagnetic induction is the operating principle behind many electric generators : for example , a rotating bar magnet creates a changing magnetic field , which in turn generates an electric field in a nearby wire .
it is sometimes called the general form of Maxwell 's equations or " Maxwell 's equations in a vacuum . "
the direct space @-@ time formulations make manifest that the Maxwell equations are relativistically invariant ( in fact studying the hidden symmetry of the vector calculus formulation was a major source of inspiration for relativity theory ) .
= = Solutions = = Maxwell 's equations are partial differential equations that relate the electric and magnetic fields to each other and to the electric charges and currents .
often , the charges and currents are themselves dependent on the electric and magnetic fields via the Lorentz force equation and the constitutive relations .
in fact , the solutions of these equations encompass all the diverse phenomena in the entire field of classical electromagnetism .
numerical methods for differential equations can be used to approximately solve Maxwell 's equations when an exact solution is impossible .
= = variations = = Popular variations on the Maxwell equations as a classical theory of electromagnetic fields are relatively scarce because the standard equations have stood the test of time remarkably well .
if they did exist , both Gauss 's law for magnetism and Faraday 's law would need to be modified , and the resulting four equations would be fully symmetric under the interchange of electric and magnetic fields .

it is difficult to give a comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms , but one common definition is that it is the ability of a system to perform work .
an example is mechanical energy which is the sum of ( usually macroscopic ) kinetic and potential energy in a system .
Gustave @-@ Gaspard Coriolis described " kinetic energy " in 1829 in its modern sense , and in 1853 , William Rankine coined the term " potential energy . "
it was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance , dubbed the caloric , or merely a physical quantity , such as momentum .
= = = Chemistry = = = In the context of chemistry , energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic , molecular or aggregate structure .
= = = Biology = = = In biology , energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the Biosphere to the smallest living organism .
in growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose , as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from .
simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones , but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren .
there are strict limits to how efficiently energy can be converted into other forms of energy via work , and heat as described by Carnot 's theorem and the second law of thermodynamics .
similarly , in the case of a chemical explosion , chemical potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy and thermal energy in a very short time .
at its lowest point the kinetic energy is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy .
in different theoretical frameworks , similar formulas were derived by J. J. Thomson ( 1881 ) , Henri Poincaré ( 1900 ) , Friedrich Hasenöhrl ( 1904 ) and others ( see Mass @-@ energy equivalence # History for further information ) .
for example , conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another , is reversible , as in the pendulum system described above .
in this case , energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space , and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space .
this mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval .
the uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured .
each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy , and all types of potential energy ( like all other types of energy ) appears as system mass , whenever present .
= = = Open systems = = = There are other ways in which an open system can gain or lose energy .
it is related to the potential energy , e.g. , molecular structure , crystal structure , and other geometric aspects , as well as the motion of the particles , in form of kinetic energy .
the general formulation of the first law ( i.e. , conservation of energy ) is valid even in situations in which the system is not homogeneous .
= = = Equipartition of energy = = = The energy of a mechanical harmonic oscillator ( a mass on a spring ) is alternatively kinetic and potential .
at two points in the oscillation cycle it is entirely kinetic , and alternatively at two other points it is entirely potential .

for instance , the largest human chromosome , chromosome number 1 , consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and is 85 MM long .
a nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide .
the two strands of DNA in a double helix can therefore be pulled apart like a zipper , either by a mechanical force or high temperature .
as a result of this complementarity , all the information in the double @-@ stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each Strand , which is vital in DNA replication .
indeed , this reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms .
in the laboratory , the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds , their melting temperature ( also called " Tm " value ) .
when all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt , the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules .
in these cases , some DNA sequences do double duty , encoding one protein when read along one Strand , and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other Strand .
if the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix , this is positive supercoiling , and the bases are held more tightly together .
the set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its genome ; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes .
the details of these functions are covered in other articles ; here we focus on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome .
the genetic information in a genome is held within genes , and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype .
a gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism .
these sequences are usually just molecular fossils , although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence .
within a gene , the sequence of bases along a DNA Strand defines a messenger RNA sequence , which then defines one or more protein sequences .
as DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA Strand in a 5 ′ to 3 ′ direction , different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix .
in this way , the base on the old Strand dictates which base appears on the new Strand , and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA .
= = = Forensics = = = Forensic scientists can use DNA in blood , semen , skin , saliva or hair found at a crime scene to identify a matching DNA of an individual , such as a perpetrator .
string searching or matching algorithms , which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters , were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides .

wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances .
waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size , from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom Nuclei .
since the energy levels of electrons in Atoms are discrete , each element and each molecule emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies .
when any wire ( or other conducting object such as an antenna ) conducts alternating current , electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the current .
one rule is obeyed regardless of circumstances : EM radiation in a vacuum travels at the speed of light , " relative to the observer , " regardless of the observer 's velocity .
both of these are ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum .

" most bacteria have not been characterized , and only about half of the phyla of bacteria have species that can be grown in the laboratory .
for about 3 billion years , all organisms were microscopic , and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life .
among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus " Mycoplasma , " which measure only 0.3 micrometres , as small as the largest viruses .

the distribution of Metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy , but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications .
bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups on the basis of three major criteria : the kind of energy used for growth , the source of carbon , and the electron donors used for growth .
carbon metabolism in bacteria is either " heterotrophic , " where organic carbon compounds are used as carbon sources , or " autotrophic , " meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide .
in " anaerobic organisms " other inorganic compounds , such as nitrate , sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors .
Fermentation is possible , because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products , which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism .
Spirochaetes of the genus " Borrelia " are a notable exception to this arrangement , with bacteria such as " Borrelia burgdorferi , " the cause of Lyme disease , containing a single linear chromosome .

after the death of Nietzsche 's grandmother in 1856 , the family moved into their own house , now Nietzsche @-@ Haus , a museum and Nietzsche study center .
after graduation in 1864 , Nietzsche commenced studies in theology and classical philology at the University of Bonn .
Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family , and , especially during this time , he and his sister had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation .
in the end , a past student of his , Heinrich Köselitz or Peter Gast , became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche .

while their counterparts at the Polytechnique were making history in the streets during " les Trois Glorieuses , " Galois and all the other students at the École Normale were locked in by the school 's director .
due to controversy surrounding the unit , soon after Galois became a member , on 31 December 1830 , the artillery of the National Guard was disbanded out of fear that they might destabilize the government .
Siméon Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations , which he did on 17 January 1831 .
what is known is that five days before his death , he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair .
this conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died .
there were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral , but during the same time frame the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque 's death , and the funeral was postponed without any uprising occurring .

in humans , for example , eye colour is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the " brown @-@ eye trait " from one of their parents .
the complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype .
the sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information , in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence .
however , while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases , most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait Loci ( multiple interacting genes ) .
recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA .
a substantial part of the variation in phenotypes in a population is caused by the differences between their genotypes .
however , even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way , traits that were lost in the past may not re @-@ evolve in an identical form ( see Dollo 's law ) .
a special case of natural selection is sexual selection , which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates .
" nature " in this sense refers to an ecosystem , that is , a system in which organisms interact with every other element , physical as well as biological , in their local environment .
this kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias , and / or because the function had a cost , and once the benefit of the function disappeared , natural selection leads to the loss .
for example , the overwhelming majority of species are microscopic prokaryotes , which form about half the world 's biomass despite their small size , and constitute the vast majority of Earth 's biodiversity .
on an even smaller scale , the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism , which then supports a small number of the animal 's germ cells to produce offspring .

General relativity , also known as the general theory of relativity , is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics .
after numerous detours and false starts , his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations .
but as early as 1916 , the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non @-@ trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations , the so @-@ called Schwarzschild metric .
this suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion , namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity .
in the language of symmetry : where gravity can be neglected , physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics .
they are defined by the set of light cones ( see the image on the left ) .
for weak gravitational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light , the theory 's predictions converge on those of Newton 's law of universal gravitation .
in the field of numerical relativity , powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein 's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes .
the latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light .
the expansion involves a series of terms ; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity , whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton 's theory due to general relativity .
light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted , whereas light sent in the opposite direction ( i.e. , climbing out of the gravity well ) is redshifted ; collectively , these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift .
however , at the current level of accuracy , these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid .
this and related predictions follow from the fact that light follows what is called a light @-@ like or null Geodesic - a generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics .
within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars , the effect is too small to be observable .
the first observation of a decrease in orbital period due to the emission of gravitational waves was made by Hulse and Taylor , using the binary pulsar PSR1913 + 16 they had discovered in 1974 .

several land @-@ based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation , most notably the interferometric detectors geo 600 , LIGO ( two detectors ) , TAMA 300 and VIRGO .
General relativity plays a central role in modelling all these phenomena , and observations provide strong evidence for the existence of black holes with the properties predicted by the theory .
astronomical observations of the cosmological expansion rate allow the total amount of matter in the universe to be estimated , although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part .
an even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe , prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity .
even more remarkably , there is a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics , which is analogous to the laws of thermodynamics .
for instance , by the second law of black hole mechanics , the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time , analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system .
there is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are , in fact , a subset of the laws of thermodynamics , and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy .
even in flat Minkowski space , when described by an accelerated observer ( Rindler space ) , there will be horizons associated with a semi @-@ classical radiation known as Unruh radiation .
the cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities ( no perfect symmetries , matter with realistic properties ) are safely hidden away behind a horizon , and thus invisible to all distant observers .
in Einstein 's theory , it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system 's total mass ( or energy ) .
the main reason is that the gravitational field - like any physical field - must be ascribed a certain energy , but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy .
in order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence ( quantum ) matter , yet not strong enough to require quantization itself , physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime .
at low energies , this approach proves successful , in that it results in an acceptable effective ( quantum ) field theory of gravity .
Mathematical relativists seek to understand the nature of singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein 's equations , and increasingly powerful computer simulations ( such as those describing merging black holes ) are run .

since the rise of experimental psychology in the 19th Century , psychology 's understanding of perception has progressed by combining a variety of techniques .
Perceptual issues in philosophy include the extent to which sensory qualities such as sound , smell or color exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver .
there is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of hypothesis testing , analogous to science , or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary .
the perceptual systems of the brain enable individuals to see the world around them as stable , even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying .

compounds of xenon bound to boron , hydrogen , bromine , iodine , beryllium , sulphur , titanium , copper , and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in noble gas matrices , or in supersonic noble gas jets .
however , due to the high radioactivity and short half @-@ life of radon isotopes , only a few fluorides and oxides of radon have been formed in practice .
similar conditions were used to obtain the first few compounds of Argon in 2000 , such as Argon fluorohydride ( HArF ) , and some bound to the late transition metals copper , silver , and gold .
because it is composed of the two most abundant elements in the universe , hydrogen and helium , it is believed to occur naturally in the interstellar medium , although it has not been detected yet .
the essential condition for their formation is that the guest ( noble gas ) Atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice .
these compounds have found use in the study of the structure and reactivity of fullerenes by means of the nuclear magnetic resonance of the noble gas atom .
for example , bonding in is described by a set of three molecular orbitals ( MOs ) derived from P @-@ orbitals on each atom .
the reason is that there is no primordial helium in the atmosphere ; due to the small mass of the atom , helium cannot be retained by the Earth 's gravitational field .
due to its high radioactivity , radon presents a significant health hazard ; it is implicated in an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States alone .
Helium is used as a component of breathing gases to replace nitrogen , due its low solubility in fluids , especially in lipids .
Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography , as a filler gas for thermometers , and in devices for measuring radiation , such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber .
the excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2 , Kr2 or Xe2 , or more commonly , the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF , KrF , XeF , or XeCl .
these lasers produce ultraviolet light which , due to its short wavelength ( 193 NM for ArF and 248 NM for KrF ) , allows for high @-@ precision imaging .
Radon , which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts , is used in radiotherapy .

Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including Hans Kramers , Oskar Klein , George de Hevesy and Werner Heisenberg .
he predicted the existence of a new zirconium @-@ like element , which was named hafnium , after the Latin name for Copenhagen , where it was discovered .
from there , he was flown to Britain , where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project , and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project .
he was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission , and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for theoretical Physics in 1957 .
Niels was a passionate footballer as well , and the two brothers played several matches for the Copenhagen @-@ based Akademisk Boldklub ( Academic Football Club ) , with Niels as goalkeeper .
his major was physics , which he studied under Professor Christian Christiansen , the university 's only professor of physics at that time .
Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father 's laboratory in the university ; the university itself had no physics laboratory .
he surveyed the literature on the subject , settling on a model postulated by Paul Drude and elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz , in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas .
Bohr extended Lorentz 's model , but was still unable to account for phenomena like the Hall effect , and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals .
the oldest , Christian , died in a boating accident in 1934 , and another , Harald , died from childhood meningitis .
like his uncle Harald , Ernest Bohr became an Olympic athlete , playing field hockey for Denmark at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London .
at the time , it was where most of the theoretical work on the structure of Atoms and molecules was being done .
Balmer 's formula was corroborated by the discovery of additional spectral lines , but for thirty years , no one could explain why it worked .
today , the Bohr model of the atom has been superseded , but is still the best known model of the atom , as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts .
he took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen , which he started by taking a holiday in Tyrol with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler .
they stayed until July 1916 , by which time he had been appointed to the Chair of theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen , a position created especially for him .
he gained the support of the Danish government and the Carlsberg Foundation , and sizeable contributions were also made by industry and private donors , many of them Jewish .
in 1922 , Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics " for his services in the investigation of the structure of Atoms and of the radiation emanating from them . "
they led to the development of matrix mechanics , the first form of modern quantum mechanics .

in a paper he presented at the Volta Conference at Como in September 1927 , he demonstrated that the uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments , without quantum terminology or matrices .
he worked on this with a new collaborator , the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar , who died suddenly in 1938 .
the discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938 ( and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner ) generated intense interest among physicists .
" based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus , Bohr concluded that it was the uranium @-@ 235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium @-@ 238 that was primarily responsible for fission .
in the enclosed letter , Bohr wrote , " It is the only thing I have to send home ; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better ...
in 1933 , the Rockefeller Foundation created a fund to help support refugee academics , and Bohr discussed this programme with the President of the Rockefeller Foundation , Max Mason , in May 1933 during a visit to the United States .
Heisenberg explained that he had visited Copenhagen to communicate to Bohr the views of several German scientists , that production of a nuclear weapon was possible with great efforts , and this raised enormous responsibilities on the world 's scientists on both sides .
on 8 December 1943 , Bohr arrived in Washington , D.C. , where he met with the director of the Manhattan Project , Brigadier General Leslie R. groves , Jr .
he visited Einstein and Pauli at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey , and went to Los Alamos in New Mexico , where the nuclear weapons were being designed .

the koala 's small brain size may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet , which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain .
for example , when presented with plucked leaves on a flat surface , the animal cannot adapt to the change in its normal feeding routine and will not eat the leaves .
since the koala gains a low amount of energy from its diet , its Metabolic rate is half that of a typical mammal , although this can vary between seasons and sexes .
the most favoured species are " Eucalyptus microcorys , " " E. tereticornis , " and " E. camaldulensis , " which , on average , make up more than 20 percent of their diet .
because they get so little energy from their diet , koalas must limit their energy use and sleep 20 hours a day ; only 4 hours a day are spent in active movement .
they typically eat and sleep in the same tree , possibly for as long as a day .

the behaviour of matter at the molecular scale including its density is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves .
mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle , but the link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until Benjamin Franklin 's proposed experiments in 1752 .
in classical electromagnetism , the electromagnetic field obeys a set of equations known as Maxwell 's equations , and the electromagnetic force is given by the Lorentz force law .
one of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with classical mechanics , but it is compatible with special relativity .
after important contributions of Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincaré , in 1905 , Albert Einstein solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity , which replaces classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics that is compatible with classical electromagnetism .
the interaction between a moving charge and an electromagnetic field is the source of the electromagnetic force , which is one of the four fundamental forces ( See also : magnetic field ) .
when the net electric charge of an object is non @-@ zero and motionless , the phenomenon is known as static electricity .
charge taken from one material is moved to the other material , leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind .
in 1839 , Michael Faraday showed that the apparent division between static electricity , current electricity , and bioelectricity was incorrect , and all were a consequence of the behavior of a single kind of electricity appearing in opposite polarities .
one of the foremost experts on electricity in the 18th century was Benjamin Franklin , who argued in favour of a one @-@ fluid theory of electricity .
Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in all matter ; for example , he believed that it was the glass in a Leyden jar that held the accumulated charge .
in contrast , electric current is the flow of electric charge through an object , which produces no net loss or gain of electric charge .
beware that , in the common and important case of metallic wires , the direction of the conventional current is opposite to the drift velocity of the actual charge carriers , i.e. , the electrons .
he is remembered today largely for his book " De Magnete " ( 1600 ) , and is credited as one of the originators of the term " electricity . "
in his book , he also studied static electricity using Amber ; Amber is called " elektron " in Greek , so Gilbert decided to call its effect the " electric force . "

to explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System , Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction , an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley .
his son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction .
in addition to his other accomplishments , William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight , but are also physical companions that form binary star systems .
the first solution to the problem of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827 .
in 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope .
once a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for jeans instability , it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force .
the duration that a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has to Fuse and the rate at which it fuses that fuel , i.e.
for the Sun , its life is estimated to be about 10 billion ( 1010 ) years .
however , since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe ( 13.8 billion years ) , no stars under about 0.85 are expected to have moved off the main sequence .
older , population II stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger , population I stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed .
in relatively old , very massive stars , a large core of inert iron will accumulate in the center of the star .
if what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth , known as a white dwarf .
the most massive stars last an average of a few million years , while stars of minimum mass ( red dwarfs ) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years .
the Sun is also a star , but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead , and to provide daylight .
other than the Sun , the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus , with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds .
= = = Kinematics = = = The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star , as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding Galaxy .
giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than main sequence stars , while the opposite is the case for degenerate , compact stars such as white dwarfs .
the surface temperature of a star , along with its visual absolute magnitude and absorption features , is used to classify a star ( see classification below ) .
in fact , stellar electromagnetic radiation spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from the longest wavelengths of radio waves through infrared , visible light , ultraviolet , to the shortest of X @-@ rays , and gamma rays .
this is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light @-@ years from the Earth , while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light @-@ years .
this can occur , for example , in regions where very high energy fluxes occur , such as near the core or in areas with high opacity as in the outer envelope .
in a main sequence star such as the Sun , the lowest level of the atmosphere is the thin chromosphere region , where spicules appear and stellar flares begin .
the hydrogen fusion process is temperature @-@ sensitive , so a moderate increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in the fusion rate .

B cells and T cells are the major types of lymphocytes and are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow .
B cells are involved in the humoral immune response , whereas T cells are involved in cell @-@ mediated immune response .
in contrast , the B cell antigen @-@ specific receptor is an antibody molecule on the B cell surface , and recognizes whole pathogens without any need for antigen processing .
the T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen .
when an activated T cell contacts such cells , it releases cytotoxins , such as perforin , which form pores in the target cell 's plasma membrane , allowing ions , water and toxins to enter .
T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC / antigen activation signal , or additional activation signals provided by " helper " T cells ( see below ) .
the MHC : antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell 's CD4 co @-@ receptor , which recruits molecules inside the T cell ( e.g. , Lck ) that are responsible for the T cell 's activation .

at lower energies , beams of accelerated Nuclei are also used in medicine as particle therapy , for the treatment of cancer .
= = = linear particle accelerators = = = In a linear particle accelerator ( linac ) , particles are accelerated in a straight line with a target of interest at one end .
as they pass through a hole in the plate , the polarity is switched so that the plate now repels them and they are now accelerated by it towards the next plate .
as the particles approach the speed of light the switching rate of the electric fields becomes so high that they operate at radio frequencies , and so microwave cavities are used in higher energy machines instead of simple plates .
therefore particle physicists do not generally think in terms of speed , but rather in terms of a particle 's energy or momentum , usually measured in electron volts ( eV ) .
the particles are injected in the centre of the magnet and are extracted at the outer edge at their maximum energy .
this approach suffers from low average beam intensity due to the bunching , and again from the need for a huge magnet of large radius and constant field over the larger orbit demanded by high energy .
higher energy particles travel a shorter distance in each orbit than they would in a classical cyclotron , thus remaining in phase with the accelerating field .
the main disadvantages are the size and cost of the large magnet needed , and the difficulty in achieving the high magnetic field values required at the outer edge of the structure .

" his father died when he was six years old , and from that point on he was raised by his mother .
Leibniz 's father had been a Professor of moral Philosophy at the University of Leipzig , and the boy later inherited his father 's personal library .
he enrolled in his father 's former university at age 15 , and completed his bachelor 's degree in Philosophy in December 1662 .
he published and defended a dissertation " specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum , " arguing for both a theoretical and a Pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law , in December 1664 .
after one year of legal studies , he was awarded his bachelor 's degree in Law on September 28 , 1665 .
in 1666 , at age 20 , Leibniz wrote his first book , " On the Art of combinations , " the first part of which was also his habilitation thesis in Philosophy .
he next declined the offer of an academic appointment at Altdorf , saying that " my thoughts were turned in an entirely different direction . "
in 1711 , while traveling in northern Europe , the Russian Tsar Peter the Great stopped in Hanover and met Leibniz , who then took some interest in Russian matters for the rest of his life .
even though Leibniz was a life member of the Royal Society and the Berlin Academy of Sciences , neither organization saw fit to honor his passing .
Leibniz dated his beginning as a philosopher to his " discourse on Metaphysics , " which he composed in 1686 as a commentary on a running dispute between Nicolas Malebranche and Antoine Arnauld .
in effect , apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world , because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws .
the answer ( according to Leibniz ) is that , while God is indeed unlimited in wisdom and power , his human creations , as creations , are limited both in their wisdom and in their will ( power to act ) .
many characters well known in his day , including Egyptian hieroglyphics , Chinese characters , and the symbols of astronomy and chemistry , he deemed not real .
what Leibniz actually intended by his " characteristica universalis " and calculus ratiocinator , and the extent to which modern formal logic does justice to the calculus , may never be established .
from 1711 until his death , Leibniz was engaged in a dispute with John Keill , Newton and others , over whether Leibniz had invented the calculus independently of Newton .
the use of infinitesimals in mathematics was frowned upon by followers of Karl Weierstrass , but survived in science and engineering , and even in rigorous mathematics , via the fundamental computational device known as the differential .

an angle 's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding Arc of a unit circle , one radian is just under 57.3 degrees ( when the Arc length is equal to the radius ) .
an alternative symbol is the superscript letter c , for " circular measure " - but this is infrequently used as it can be easily mistaken for a degree symbol ( ° ) .
the idea of measuring angles by the length of the Arc was already in use by other mathematicians .
in all such cases it is found that the arguments to the functions are most naturally written in the form that corresponds , in geometrical contexts , to the radian measurement of angles .
although polar and spherical coordinates use radians to describe coordinates in two and three dimensions , the unit is derived from the radius coordinate , so the angle measure is still dimensionless .
= = Use in physics = = The radian is widely used in physics when angular measurements are required .
a milliradian ( mrad ) is a thousandth of a radian and a microradian ( urad or μrad ) is a millionth of a radian , i.e.

in physics , a force is said to do work if , when acting on a body , there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force .
= = Units = = The SI unit of work is the joule ( J ) , which is defined as the work expended by a force of one newton through a distance of one metre .
the dimensionally equivalent newton @-@ metre ( N · m ) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work , but this can be confused with the unit newton @-@ metre , which is the measurement unit of torque .
due to work having the same physical dimension as heat , occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content , such as therm , BTU and Calorie , are utilized as a measuring unit .
if external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table , then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards .
the sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work , : formula _ 7where " C " is the trajectory from x ( t1 ) to x ( t2 ) .
if the force is always directed along this line , and the magnitude of the force is " F , " then this integral simplifies to : formula _ 8where " s " is distance along the line .
if F is constant , in addition to being directed along the line , then the integral simplifies further to : formula _ 9where " s " is the distance travelled by the point along the line .
this calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line , followed by the particle .
thus , no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit ( this is ideal , as all orbits are slightly elliptical ) .
this integral depends on the rotational trajectory " φ ( t ) , " and is therefore path @-@ dependent .
= = Work and potential energy = = The scalar product of a force F and the velocity V of its point of application defines the power input to a system at an instant of time .
integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application , " C " = x ( t ) , defines the work input to the system by the force .
it is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the center of mass of the object .
in more general systems work can change the potential energy of a mechanical device , the heat energy in a thermal system , or the electrical energy in an electrical device .
the work of the net force is calculated as the product of its magnitude and the particle displacement .
this can also be written as : formula _ 54This integral is computed along the trajectory X ( t ) of the particle and is therefore path dependent .
to see this , let the forces F1 , F2 ... Fn act on the points X1 , X2 ... Xn in a rigid body .

Ununoctium is the temporary IUPAC name for the transactinide element with the atomic number 118 and temporary element symbol Uuo .
for example , although ununoctium is a member of group 18 , it may possibly not be a noble gas , unlike all the other group 18 elements .
in June 2002 , the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author Victor Ninov .
some isotopes with many more neutrons , such as some located around 313Uuo could also provide longer @-@ lived Nuclei .
the members of this group are usually inert to most common chemical reactions ( for example , combustion ) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons .
the bonding between ununoctium and hydrogen in UuoH is predicted to be very limp and can be regarded as a pure van der Waals interaction rather than a true chemical bond .
for example , it was shown that the reaction of ununoctium with to form the compound would release an energy of 106 kcal / MOL of which about 46 kcal / MOL come from these interactions .

the Navier @-@ Stokes equations are the most general governing equations of fluid flow and are difficult to solve .
the differences in air flows under these conditions led to problems in aircraft control , increased drag due to shock waves , and structural dangers due to aeroelastic flutter .
the ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach , who was one of the first to investigate the properties of supersonic flow .
in many aerodynamics problems , the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight : lift , drag , thrust , and weight .
Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere .
on a molecular level , flow fields are made up of many individual collisions between gas molecules and between gas molecules and solid surfaces .
for example , many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions , where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers .
= = branches of aerodynamics = = Aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow , including flow speed , compressibility , and viscosity .
evaluating the lift and drag on an airplane or the shock waves that form in front of the nose of a rocket are examples of external aerodynamics .
Aerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the flow speed is below , near or above the speed of sound .
= = = = Subsonic flow = = = = Subsonic ( or low @-@ speed ) aerodynamics studies fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow .
in general , this is the case where the Mach number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3 .

the star reaches the main sequence when the core reaches a temperature high enough to begin fusing hydrogen ( a few million kelvin ) and establishes hydrostatic equilibrium .
over its main sequence life , the star slowly converts the hydrogen in the core into helium ; its main @-@ sequence life ends when nearly all the hydrogen in the core has been fused .
when the star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core , nuclear reactions can no longer continue and so the core begins to contract due to its own gravity .
once the star is fusing helium in its core , it contracts and is no longer considered a red giant .
in stars massive enough to ignite helium fusion , an analogous process occurs when the central helium is exhausted and the star collapses once again , causing helium in an outer shell to begin fusing .
at the same time hydrogen may begin fusion in a shell just outside the burning helium shell .
the helium fusion results in the build up of a carbon @-@ oxygen core .
however these giant planets are more massive than the giant planets found around solar @-@ type stars .

the magnetic force component of the Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current @-@ carrying wire in a magnetic field .
in all these descriptions , the force was always given in terms of the properties of the objects involved and the distances between them rather than in terms of electric and magnetic fields .
J. J. Thomson was the first to attempt to derive from Maxwell 's field equations the electromagnetic forces on a moving charged object in terms of the object 's properties and external fields .
finally , in 1892 , Hendrik Lorentz derived the modern form of the formula for the electromagnetic force which includes the contributions to the total force from both the electric and the magnetic fields .
thus , Maxwell 's equations do not stand separate from other physical laws , but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities .
in real materials the Lorentz force is inadequate to describe the behavior of charged particles , both in principle and as a matter of computation .
= = Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B = = In many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism , the Lorentz force Law is used as the " definition " of the electric and magnetic fields E and B.
so the two vector fields E and B are thereby defined throughout space and time , and these are called the " electric field " and " magnetic field . "
these effects occur through both a direct effect ( called the radiation reaction force ) and indirectly ( by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents ) .
both of these EMF 's , despite their different origins , can be described by the same equation , namely , the EMF is the rate of change of magnetic flux through the wire .
the reverse is also true , the Lorentz force and the Maxwell Equations can be used to derive the Faraday Law .
