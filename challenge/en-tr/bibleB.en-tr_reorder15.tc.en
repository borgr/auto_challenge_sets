and the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens ,
in the sweat of THY face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
so he drove out the man ; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims , and a flaming sword which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
and it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born unto them ,
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose .
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of : the length of the Ark shall be three hundred cubits , the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits .
but with thee will I establish my Covenant ; and thou shalt come into the Ark , thou , and THY sons , and THY wife , and THY sons ' wives with thee .
and of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the Ark , to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep them alive .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
and Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him , into the Ark , because of the waters of the flood .
in the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the Ark ;
they , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the Ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
and God remembered Noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that was with him in the Ark : and God made a wind to pass over the earth , and the waters asswaged ;
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
and Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father 's nakedness .
and the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as thou comest to Gerar , unto Gaza ; as thou goest , unto Sodom , and Gomorrah , and Admah , and Zeboim , even unto Lasha .
and it came to pass , as they journeyed from the east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar ; and they dwelt there .
and the Lord said , behold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they have imagined to do .
therefore is the name of it called Babel ; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth .
and Abram and Nahor took them wives : the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai ; and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah , and the father of Iscah .
and there was a famine in the land : and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine was grievous in the land .
therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save thee alive .
why saidst thou , She is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold THY wife , take her , and go THY way .
and there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram 's cattle and the herdmen of lot 's cattle : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew ; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eschol , and brother of Aner : and these were confederate with Abram .
and he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smote them , and pursued them unto Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
and , behold , the word of the Lord came unto him , saying , This shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and Sarai Abram 's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian , after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife .
and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and THY seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting Covenant , to be a God unto thee , and to THY seed after thee .
and as for Ishmael , I have heard thee : behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt .
and lot went up out of Zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he feared to dwell in Zoar : and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters .
and they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
and they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger arose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
and he communed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
and Abraham hearkened unto Ephron ; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant .
and after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre : the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan .
and I will make thee swear by the Lord , the God of heaven , and the God of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I dwell :
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor .
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
and the damsel was very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pitcher , and came up .
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels were coming .
and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
and these are the years of the life of Ishmael , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the ghost and died ; and was gathered unto his people .
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan @-@ aram , the sister to Laban the Syrian .
and I will make THY seed to multiply as the stars of heaven , and will give unto THY seed all these countries ; and in THY seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife .
for all the wells which his father 's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped them , and filled them with earth .
and it came to pass the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had digged , and said unto him , We have found water .
go now to the flock , and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats ; and I will make them savoury meat for THY father , such as he loveth :
and Isaac his father answered and said unto him , behold , THY dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
and by THY sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve THY brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off THY neck .
and he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven : and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
and Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pillows , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it .
and thither were all the flocks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in his place .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in unto her .
and it came to pass , when Rachel had born Joseph , that Jacob said unto Laban , Send me away , that I may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink .
and it came to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods .
and he said , Lift up now thine eyes , and see , all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked , speckled , and grisled : for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee .
and Laban went into Jacob 's tent , and into Leah 's tent , and into the two maidservants ' tents ; but he found them not . then went he out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
now therefore come thou , let us make a Covenant , I and thou ; and let it be for a witness between me and thee .
then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tarried all night in the mount .
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto THY servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
and Jacob came to Shalem , a city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Padan @-@ aram ; and pitched his tent before the city .
and when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , prince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and defiled her .
and the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter : and he was more honourable than all the house of his father .
and they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went out .
they took their sheep , and their oxen , and their asses , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ,
and let us arise , and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand , and all their earrings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem .
so Jacob came to Luz , which is in the land of Canaan , that is , Bethel , he and all the people that were with him .
and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him , even a pillar of stone : and he poured a drink offering thereon , and he poured oil thereon .
and Husham died , and Hadad the son of Bedad , who smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
and these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; Duke Timnah , Duke Alvah , Duke Jetheth ,
come now therefore , and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some evil beast hath devoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
and they took him , and cast him into a pit : and the pit was empty , there was no water in it .
then there passed by Midianites merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites , which had brought him down thither .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spake unto him , saying , After this manner did THY servant to me ; that his wrath was kindled .
and the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the doer of it .
and in the vine were three branches : and it was as though it budded , and her blossoms shot forth ; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes :
and Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand .
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head , and restore thee unto THY place : and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh 's cup into his hand , after the former manner when thou wast his Butler .
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up THY head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat THY flesh from off thee .
and it came to pass the third day , which was Pharaoh 's birthday , that he made a feast unto all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief Butler and of the chief Baker among his servants .
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and leanfleshed ; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them , poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness :
and when they had eaten them up , it could not be known that they had eaten them ; but they were still ill favoured , as at the beginning . so I awoke .
let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint officers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
and Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the famine was over all the face of the earth : and Joseph opened all the storehouses , and sold unto the Egyptians ; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt .
and he said , behold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt : get you down thither , and buy for us from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
and he turned himself about from them , and wept ; and returned to them again , and communed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn , and to restore every man 's money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he unto them .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the Inn , he espied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack 's mouth .
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks , carry it again in your hand ; peradventure it was an oversight :
and the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and rose up , and went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
and they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they communed with him at the door of the house ,
and when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed themselves to him to the earth .
and put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack 's mouth of the youngest , and his corn money . and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan : how then should we steal out of THY lord 's house silver or gold ?
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
so now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , Joseph 's brethren are come : and it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
and take your father and your households , and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
and they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said unto them : and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob their father revived :
and Joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Goshen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
and Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
and now THY two sons , Ephraim and Manasseh , which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt , are mine ; as Reuben and Simeon , they shall be mine .
and Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near unto him .
O my soul , come not thou into their secret ; unto their assembly , mine honour , be not thou united : for in their anger they slew a man , and in their selfwill they digged down a wall .
but his bow abode in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob ; ( from thence is the shepherd , the stone of Israel : )
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel : and this is it that their father spake unto them , and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
and the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew Midwives , of which the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah :
and the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river ; and her maidens walked along by the river 's side ; and when she saw the Ark among the flags , she sent her maid to fetch it .
and when she had opened it , she saw the child : and , behold , the babe wept . and she had compassion on him , and said , This is one of the Hebrews ' children .
and it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren , and looked on their burdens : and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew , one of his brethren .
and he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he slew the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian : and he sat down by a well .
now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law , the priest of Midian : and he led the flock to the backside of the desert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Horeb .
moreover he said , I am the God of THY father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them .
and I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
and he said , Put thine hand into THY bosom again . and he put his hand into his bosom again ; and plucked it out of his bosom , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth : and I will be with THY mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be THY spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him instead of God .
and Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
and the people believed : and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshipped .
and I have also established my Covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage ; and I have remembered my Covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and Amram took him Jochebed his father 's sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Eleazar Aaron 's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife ; and she bare him Phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
these are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Moses and Aaron .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch forth thine hand with THY rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
and the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
and the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children 's of Israel .
and Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
for I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart , and upon THY servants , and upon THY people ; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
behold , to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the Lord sent Thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
so there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
and the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the coasts of Egypt : very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
and the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind , which took away the locusts , and cast them into the Red sea ; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt .
speak now in the ears of the people , and let every man borrow of his neighbour , and every woman of her neighbour , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold .
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
speak ye unto all the Congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house :
and if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls ; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb .
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the Congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keep this service .
and Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not leavened ; because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselves any victual .
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the selfsame day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
that thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix , and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the Lord 's .
but God led the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt .
and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
but lift thou up THY rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and troubled the host of the Egyptians ,
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
but the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord , and spake , saying , I will sing unto the Lord , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his Rider hath he thrown into the sea .
fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till THY people pass over , O Lord , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and it came to pass , as Aaron spake unto the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and , behold , the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud .
and it came to pass , that at even the quails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when they did Mete it with an Omer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his eating .
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and stank : and Moses was wroth with them .
and it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for one man : and all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses .
and the children of Israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
and it came to pass , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed : and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
when Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
and Jethro , Moses ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness , where he encamped at the mount of God :
and Moses went out to meet his father in law , and did obeisance , and kissed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
and Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
and Jethro , Moses ' father in law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God : and Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father in law before God .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai .
for they were departed from Rephidim , and were come to the desert of Sinai , and had pitched in the wilderness ; and there Israel camped before the mount .
and Moses went up unto God , and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ;
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my Covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
and the Lord came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
Thou shalt not covet THY neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet THY neighbour 's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is THY neighbour 's .
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hewn stone : for if thou lift up THY tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
if she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smote him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past , and his owner hath not kept him in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be his own .
if the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods .
for that is his covering only , it is his raiment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ? and it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gracious .
and in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect : and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of THY mouth .
for mine Angel shall go before thee , and bring thee in unto the Amorites , and the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites : and I will cut them off .
and ye shall serve the Lord your God , and he shall bless THY bread , and THY water ; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee .
and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel .
and Moses went into the midst of the cloud , and gat him up into the mount : and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights .
according to all that I shew thee , after the pattern of the tabernacle , and the pattern of all the instruments thereof , even so shall ye make it .
and they shall make an Ark of shittim wood : two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , within and without shalt thou overlay it , and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in the four corners thereof ; and two rings shall be in the one side of it , and two rings in the other side of it .
and thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the Ark , that the Ark may be borne with them .
and make one cherub on the one end , and the other cherub on the other end : even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high , covering the mercy seat with their wings , and their faces shall look one to another ; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be .
and thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about , and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about .
and thou shalt make the dishes thereof , and spoons thereof , and covers thereof , and bowls thereof , to cover withal : of pure gold shalt thou make them .
and thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling ; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
and the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent , the half curtain that remaineth , shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt overlay the boards with gold , and make their rings of gold for places for the bars : and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold .
and thou shalt set the table without the vail , and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south : and thou shalt put the table on the north side .
and thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof : his horns shall be of the same : and thou shalt overlay it with brass .
and likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long , and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
and thou shalt set in it settings of stones , even four rows of stones : the first row shall be a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this shall be the first row .
and thou shalt make two rings of gold , and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof , which is in the side of the ephod inward .
and two other rings of gold thou shalt make , and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart thereof , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
and beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , round about the hem thereof ; and bells of gold between them round about :
and it shall be upon Aaron to minister : and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the Lord , and when he cometh out , that he die not .
and thou shalt put it on a blue lace , that it may be upon the Mitre ; upon the forefront of the Mitre it shall be .
and for Aaron 's sons thou shalt make coats , and thou shalt make for them girdles , and bonnets shalt thou make for them , for glory and for beauty .
and thou shalt put them upon Aaron THY brother , and his sons with him ; and shalt anoint them , and consecrate them , and sanctify them , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and thou shalt take the garments , and put upon Aaron the coat , and the robe of the ephod , and the ephod , and the breastplate , and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod :
and thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock .
and thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul that is above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and burn them upon the altar .
and thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron , and in the hands of his sons ; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord .
and thou shalt receive them of their hands , and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour before the Lord : it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and if ought of the flesh of the consecrations , or of the bread , remain unto the morning , then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire : it shall not be eaten , because it is holy .
and I will sanctify the tabernacle of the Congregation , and the altar : I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons , to minister to me in the priest 's office .
and they shall know that I am the Lord their God , that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I may dwell among them : I am the Lord their God .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , the top thereof , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns thereof ; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the Ark of the testimony , before the mercy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with thee .
this they shall give , every one that passeth among them that are numbered , half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary : ( a shekel is twenty gerahs : ) an half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord .
the rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel , when they give an offering unto the Lord , to make an Atonement for your souls .
upon man 's flesh shall it not be poured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is holy , and it shall be holy unto you .
and thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the Congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
and as for the perfume which thou shalt make , ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof : it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord .
and the cloths of service , and the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office ,
Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it is holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and Aaron said unto them , Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
and Moses besought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why doth THY wrath wax hot against THY people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
and Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and he said , It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the noise of them that sing do I hear .
and he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Who is on the Lord 's side ? let him come unto me . and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Lord ; peradventure I shall make an Atonement for your sin .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin-- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of THY book which thou hast written .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tabernacle .
and it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the Lord talked with Moses .
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rose up and worshipped , every man in his tent door .
observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
and thou take of their daughters unto THY sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make THY sons go a whoring after their gods .
for I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge THY borders : neither shall any man desire THY land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord THY God thrice in the year .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the vail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
and Moses gathered all the Congregation of the children of Israel together , and said unto them , These are the words which the Lord hath commanded , that ye should do them .
and the incense altar , and his staves , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle ,
the cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office .
and all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands , and brought that which they had spun , both of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine linen .
the children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses .
and he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling : likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
fifty loops made he in one curtain , and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second : the loops held one curtain to another .
and he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
one cherub on the end on this side , and another cherub on the other end on that side : out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spoons , and his bowls , and his covers to cover withal , of pure gold .
and he made the candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work made he the candlestick ; his Shaft , and his branch , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , were of the same :
and six branches going out of the sides thereof ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof :
and he overlaid it with pure gold , both the top of it , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns of it : also he made unto it a crown of gold round about .
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the staves to bear it withal .
and he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood : five cubits was the length thereof , and five cubits the breadth thereof ; it was foursquare ; and three cubits the height thereof .
and he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it ; the horns thereof were of the same : and he overlaid it with brass .
and he made all the vessels of the altar , the pots , and the shovels , and the basons , and the fleshhooks , and the firepans : all the vessels thereof made he of brass .
and he made the laver of brass , and the foot of it of brass , of the lookingglasses of the women assembling , which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and the sockets for the pillars were of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver ; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver .
and with him was Aholiab , son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan , an engraver , and a cunning workman , and an embroiderer in blue , and in purple , and in scarlet , and fine linen .
and the silver of them that were numbered of the Congregation was an hundred talents , and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
and they did beat the gold into thin plates , and cut it into wires , to work it in the blue , and in the purple , and in the scarlet , and in the fine linen , with cunning work .
and he put them on the shoulders of the ephod , that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names , like the engravings of a signet , every one with his name , according to the twelve tribes .
and they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the breastplate , upon the border of it , which was on the side of the ephod inward .
and they made two other golden rings , and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart of it , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
and there was an hole in the midst of the robe , as the hole of an habergeon , with a band round about the hole , that it should not rend .
and they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the engravings of a signet , HOLINESS TO the Lord .
and Moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they have done it as the Lord had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
and thou shalt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick , and light the lamps thereof .
and thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy .
and thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
and Moses reared up the tabernacle , and fastened his sockets , and set up the boards thereof , and put in the bars thereof , and reared up his pillars .
and he brought the Ark into the tabernacle , and set up the vail of the covering , and covered the Ark of the testimony ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . so Moses finished the work .
for the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day , and fire was on it by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their journeys .
if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd , let him offer a male without blemish : he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord .
and he shall kill the bullock before the Lord : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall bring the blood , and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .

and he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar .
and the priest shall bring it unto the altar , and wring off his head , and burn it on the altar ; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar :
and he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers , and cast it beside the altar on the east part , by the place of the ashes :
and the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire .
and thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the Lord : and when it is presented unto the priest , he shall bring it unto the altar .
and the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof , and shall burn it upon the altar : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire .
and every oblation of THY meat offering shalt thou season with salt ; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the Covenant of THY God to be lacking from THY meat offering : with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt .
and the priest shall burn the memorial of it , part of the beaten corn thereof , and part of the oil thereof , with all the frankincense thereof : it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation : and Aaron 's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,

speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them :
if the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sinned , a young bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering .
and he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord ; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock 's head , and kill the bullock before the Lord .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away ,
when the sin , which they have sinned against it , is known , then the Congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin , and bring him before the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the priest shall make an Atonement for them , and it shall be forgiven them .
or if his sin , wherein he hath sinned , come to his knowledge ; he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a male without blemish :
and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar , as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if any one of the common people sin through ignorance , while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ;
or if his sin , which he hath sinned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without blemish , for his sin which he hath sinned .
and the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar .
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar :
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of swearing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his iniquity .
and he shall bring them unto the priest , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wring off his head from his neck , but shall not divide it asunder :
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord , a ram without blemish out of the flock , with THY estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest :
and he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
and the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat : with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tabernacle of the Congregation they shall eat it .
the priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it : in the holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy : and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment , thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place .
and no sin offering , whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the Congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place , shall be eaten : it shall be burnt in the fire .
and the priest that offereth any man 's burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
and all the meat offering that is baken in the oven , and all that is dressed in the fryingpan , and in the pan , shall be the priest 's that offereth it .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the Lord , and it shall be the priest 's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings .
and the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for Thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered ; he shall not leave any of it until the morning .
his own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire , the fat with the breast , it shall he bring , that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord .
and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards , and caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and Moses burned it upon the altar .
and ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation in seven days , until the days of your consecration be at an end : for seven days shall he consecrate you .
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram , the rump , and that which covereth the inwards , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver :
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the hoof : as the Camel , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
and all that have not fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you :
of all meat which may be eaten , that on which such water cometh shall be unclean : and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean .
and he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
whatsoever goeth upon the belly , and whatsoever goeth upon all four , or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an abomination .
who shall offer it before the Lord , and make an Atonement for her ; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hath born a male or a female .
but if the scab spread much abroad in the skin , after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the priest again :
and the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the rising be white in the skin , and it have turned the hair white , and there be quick raw flesh in the rising ;
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague : and , behold , if the scall spread not , and there be in it no yellow hair , and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin ;
and he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , he is forehead bald : yet is he clean .
he shall therefore burn that garment , whether warp or woof , in woollen or in linen , or any thing of skin , wherein the plague is : for it is a fretting leprosy ; it shall be burnt in the fire .
and if it appear still in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a spreading plague : thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire .
and the priest shall go forth out of the camp ; and the priest shall look , and , behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ;
and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
and the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean , and those things , before the Lord , at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord :
and the remnant of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him before the Lord .
and the priest shall offer the sin offering , and make an Atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness ; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering :
and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him , and he shall be clean .
and the rest of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed , to make an Atonement for him before the Lord .
when ye be come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and the priest shall come again the seventh day , and shall look : and , behold , if the plague be spread in the walls of the house ;
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other morter , and shall plaister the house .
and if the plague come again , and break out in the house , after that he hath taken away the stones , and after he hath scraped the house , and after it is plaistered ;
then the priest shall come and look , and , behold , if the plague be spread in the house , it is a fretting leprosy in the house : it is unclean .
and he shall break down the house , the stones of it , and the timber thereof , and all the morter of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place .
and this shall be his uncleanness in his issue : whether his flesh run with his issue , or his flesh be stopped from his issue , it is his uncleanness .
and whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue , and hath not rinsed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , and come before the Lord unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and give them unto the priest :
and the priest shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an Atonement for him before the Lord for his issue .
every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation : and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean , as the uncleanness of her separation .
but the goat , on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat , shall be presented alive before the Lord , to make an Atonement with him , and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness .
and Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and shall make an Atonement for himself , and for his house , and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself :
and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord , and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small , and bring it within the vail :
and he shall take of the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward ; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times .
and Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the Congregation , and shall put off the linen garments , which he put on when he went into the holy place , and shall leave them there :
speak unto Aaron , and unto his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them ; This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded , saying ,
what man soever there be of the house of Israel , that killeth an ox , or lamb , or goat , in the camp , or that killeth it out of the camp ,
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , to offer it unto the Lord ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people .
therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity , because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of THY field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of THY harvest .
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment : thou shalt not respect the person of the poor , nor honour the person of the mighty : but in righteousness shalt thou judge THY neighbour .
just balances , just weights , a just ephah , and a just hin , shall ye have : I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall surely be put to death : they have wrought confusion ; their blood shall be upon them .
if a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and for his sister a virgin , that is nigh unto him , which hath had no husband ; for her may he be defiled .
they shall not take a wife that is a whore , or profane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his God .
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor profane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him : I am the Lord .
for whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish , he shall not approach : a blind man , or a lame , or he that hath a flat nose , or any thing superfluous ,
the soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he wash his flesh with water .
but if the priest buy any soul with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of Atonement , to make an Atonement for you before the Lord your God .
for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
and the son of an Israelitish woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp ;
that which groweth of its own accord of THY harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of THY vine undressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of Atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land .
and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
if THY brother be waxen poor , and hath sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kin come to redeem it , then shall he redeem that which his brother sold .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
both THY bondmen , and THY bondmaids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile , then he shall count with him , and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bondmen ; and I have broken the bands of your yoke , and made you go upright .
and if ye shall despise my statutes , or if your soul abhor my judgments , so that ye will not do all my commandments , but that ye break my Covenant :
and your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
I will also send wild beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be desolate .
and when I have broken the staff of your bread , ten women shall bake your bread in one oven , and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfied .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it were before a sword , when none pursueth : and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies .
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies ' lands ; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them .
and that I also have walked contrary unto them , and have brought them into the land of their enemies ; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled , and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity :
then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob , and also my Covenant with Isaac , and also my Covenant with Abraham will I remember ; and I will remember the land .
and THY estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old , even THY estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
and if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old , then THY estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels , and for the female ten shekels .
and if it be any unclean beast , of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the Lord , then he shall present the beast before the priest :
and if he will not redeem the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more .
in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong .

so were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel , by the house of their fathers , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war in Israel ;
but the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony , that there be no wrath upon the Congregation of the children of Israel : and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony .
and on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies : and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of the children of Judah .

and they shall keep his charge , and the charge of the whole Congregation before the tabernacle of the Congregation , to do the service of the tabernacle .
and they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and the charge of the children of Israel , to do the service of the tabernacle .
and I , behold , I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel : therefore the Levites shall be mine ;
those that were numbered of them , according to the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred .
and the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the Congregation shall be the tabernacle , and the tent , the covering thereof , and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation ,

of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money ; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
and when the camp setteth forward , Aaron shall come , and his sons , and they shall take down the covering vail , and cover the Ark of testimony with it :
and they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet , and cover the same with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put in the staves thereof .
from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them ; all that enter in to perform the service , to do the work in the tabernacle of the Congregation .
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .

and the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the Lord spake unto Moses , so did the children of Israel .

but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of THY husband , and if thou be defiled , and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband :
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the Lord , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an Atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
and he shall consecrate unto the Lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled .
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord , with the basket of unleavened bread : the priest shall offer also his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes offered their offering before the altar .
and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold , unto the Shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the Lord had shewed Moses , so he made the candlestick .
for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel ; instead of such as open every womb , even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel , have I taken them unto me .
and the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and there were certain men , who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the passover on that day : and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said unto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle , namely , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
at the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel journeyed , and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched : as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents .
and so it was , when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle ; according to the commandment of the Lord they abode in their tents , and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed .
at the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents , and at the commandment of the Lord they journeyed : they kept the charge of the Lord , at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
make thee two trumpets of silver ; of a whole piece shalt thou make them : that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly , and for the journeying of the camps .
and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies : and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab .

and while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ERE it was chewed , the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people , and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague .
( now the man Moses was very meek , above all the men which were upon the face of the earth . )
and the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam : and they both came forth .
with him will I speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches ; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold : wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ?
and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they dwell in , whether in tents , or in strong holds ;
and they ascended by the south , and came unto Hebron ; where Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were . ( now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
and they came unto the Brook of Eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the pomegranates , and of the figs .
and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole Congregation said unto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this wilderness !
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , which have murmured against me ,
doubtless ye shall not come into the land , concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein , save Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of nun .
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even forty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your iniquities , even forty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord .
Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering : as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor , so shall ye heave it .
and the priest shall make an Atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord , to make an Atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them .
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the Lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us ?
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that appertained unto Korah , and all their goods .
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the Congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an Atonement for the people .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's rod , whom I shall choose , shall blossom : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , whereby they murmur against you .
and they shall keep THY charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and I , behold , I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and , behold , I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance , for their service which they serve , even the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you , as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor , and as the fulness of the winepress .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and they fell upon their faces : and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them .
Aaron shall be gathered unto his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel , because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah .
and when king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea , to compass the land of Edom : and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way .
from thence they removed , and pitched on the other side of Arnon , which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites : for Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
for Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto Arnon .
for there is a fire gone out of Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sihon : it hath consumed Ar of Moab , and the lords of the high places of Arnon .
and they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at Edrei .
and the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto Balaam , and spake unto him the words of Balak .
and God 's anger was kindled because he went : and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he smote her again .
and the angel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she fell down under Balaam : and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he smote the ass with a staff .
then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and when Balak heard that Balaam was come , he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab , which is in the border of Arnon , which is in the utmost coast .
behold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drink the blood of the slain .
he shall pour the water out of his buckets , and his seed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than Agag , and his kingdom shall be exalted .
God brought him forth out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn : he shall eat up the nations his enemies , and shall break their bones , and Pierce them through with his arrows .
and Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together : and Balak said unto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
and when Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he rose up from among the Congregation , and took a javelin in his hand ;
now the name of the Israelite that was slain , even that was slain with the Midianitish woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites .
and the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was head over a people , and of a chief house in Midian .
and the sons of Judah after their families were ; of Shelah , the family of the Shelanites : of Pharez , the family of the Pharzites : of Zerah , the family of the Zarhites .
of the sons of Zebulun after their families : of Sered , the family of the Sardites : of Elon , the family of the Elonites : of Jahleel , the family of the Jahleelites .
these are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those that were numbered of them , thirty and two thousand and five hundred . these are the sons of Joseph after their families .
all the families of the Shuhamites , according to those that were numbered of them , were threescore and four thousand and four hundred .
these are the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered of them ; who were fifty and three thousand and four hundred .
to many thou shalt give the more inheritance , and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance : to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him .
these are the families of the Levites : the family of the Libnites , the family of the Hebronites , the family of the Mahlites , the family of the Mushites , the family of the Korathites . and Kohath begat Amram .
and the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt : and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
the daughters of Zelophehad speak right : thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father 's brethren ; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them .
for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin , in the strife of the Congregation , to sanctify me at the water before their eyes : that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin .
and the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb : in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the Lord for a drink offering .
also in the day of the firstfruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the Lord , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
if a man vow a vow unto the Lord , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
and Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
and Moses was wroth with the officers of the host , with the captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of beast , thou , and Eleazar the priest , and the chief fathers of the Congregation :
and divide the prey into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the Congregation :
and the booty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
and the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep :
( now the half that pertained unto the Congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep ,
and the officers which were over thousands of the host , the captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , came near unto Moses :
and they said unto Moses , Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge , and there lacketh not one man of us .
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels .
and the Lord 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the Lord , was consumed .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them unto their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
and the land be subdued before the Lord : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the Lord , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
and they departed from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians .
and they departed from before Pi @-@ hahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness , and went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and pitched in Marah .
and they removed from Marah , and came unto Elim : and in Elim were twelve fountains of water , and threescore and ten palm trees ; and they pitched there .
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their molten images , and quite pluck down all their high places :
from mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad :
and the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall descend , and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward :
command the children of Israel , that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them .
and the suburbs of the cities , which ye shall give unto the Levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about .
and among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge , which ye shall appoint for the manslayer , that he may flee thither : and to them ye shall add forty and two cities .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their suburbs .
Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan , which shall be cities of refuge .
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the Slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
Whoso killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge , that he should come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
this is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us .
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
and command thou the people , saying , Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau , which dwell in Seir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore :
Ye shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
and the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim , even unto Azzah , the Caphtorims , which came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead . )
only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not , nor unto any place of the river Jabbok , nor unto the cities in the mountains , nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbad us .
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon ;
and the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , being the kingdom of Og , gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , with all Bashan , which was called the land of giants .
and unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley , and the border even unto the river Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
O Lord God , thou hast begun to shew THY servant THY greatness , and THY mighty hand : for what God is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to THY works , and according to THY might ?
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you .
furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , and sware that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in unto that good land , which the Lord THY God giveth thee for an inheritance :
but if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord THY God , thou shalt find him , if thou seek him with all THY heart and with all THY soul .
when thou art in tribulation , and all these things are come upon thee , even in the latter days , if thou turn to the Lord THY God , and shalt be obedient unto his voice ;
and because he loved THY fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt ;
that the Slayer might flee thither , which should kill his neighbour unawares , and hated him not in times past ; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live :
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgments , which Moses spake unto the children of Israel , after they came forth out of Egypt ,
( I stood between the Lord and you at that time , to shew you the work of the Lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
Thou shalt not make thee any Graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the waters beneath the earth :
go thou near , and hear all that the Lord our God shall say : and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee ; and we will hear it , and do it .
( for the Lord THY God is a Jealous God among you ) lest the anger of the Lord THY God be kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the Lord sware unto THY fathers ,
and the Lord will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee ; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
and thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord THY God shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
and the Lord THY God will put out those nations before thee by little and little : thou mayest not consume them at once , lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee .
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
but thou shalt remember the Lord THY God : for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his Covenant which he sware unto THY fathers , as it is this day .
and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his stead .
and his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ;
and that ye may prolong your days in the land , which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
a land which the Lord THY God careth for : the eyes of the Lord THY God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in THY corn , and THY wine , and thine oil .
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul , and bind them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as frontlets between your eyes .
and ye shall teach them your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord THY God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim , and the curse upon mount Ebal .
these are the statutes and judgments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the Lord God of THY fathers giveth thee to possess it , all the days that ye live upon the earth .
Ye shall utterly destroy all the places , wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree :
and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto , ye and your households , wherein the Lord THY God hath blessed thee .
but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of THY tribes , there thou shalt offer THY burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , whereof he spake unto thee , saying , Let us go after other gods , which thou hast not known , and let us serve them ;
Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams : for the Lord your God proveth you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord THY God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
then shalt thou inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought among you ;
Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein , and the cattle thereof , with the edge of the sword .
for thou art an holy people unto the Lord THY God , and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claws , and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the Lord THY God shall choose :
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto THY brother , to THY poor , and to THY needy , in THY land .
Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of THY flock , and out of THY floor , and out of THY winepress : of that wherewith the Lord THY God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the Lord THY God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there .
and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord THY God shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto THY tents .
seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
if there be found among you , within any of THY gates which the Lord THY God giveth thee , man or woman , that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord THY God , in transgressing his Covenant ,
and it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inquired diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought in Israel :
and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those days , and inquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment :
and thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee :
and if a Levite come from any of THY gates out of all Israel , where he sojourned , and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the Lord shall choose ;
for these nations , which thou shalt possess , hearkened unto observers of times , and unto diviners : but as for thee , the Lord THY God hath not suffered thee so to do .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but if any man hate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and smite him mortally that he die , and fleeth into one of these cities :
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people , that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
but thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; as the Lord THY God hath commanded thee :
and it shall be , that the city which is next unto the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take an heifer , which hath not been wrought with , and which hath not drawn in the yoke ;
then it shall be , when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated , which is indeed the firstborn :
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;
and give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an evil name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a maid :
then shall the father of the damsel , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel 's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate :
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and slayeth him , even so is this matter :
because they met you not with bread and with water in the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt ; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse thee .
but it shall be , when evening cometh on , he shall wash himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
and thou shalt have a paddle upon THY weapon ; and it shall be , when thou wilt ease thyself abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee :
he shall dwell with thee , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of THY gates , where it liketh him best : thou shalt not oppress him .
that which is gone out of THY lips thou shalt keep and perform ; even a freewill offering , according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord THY God , which thou hast promised with THY mouth .
when thou comest into THY neighbour 's vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes THY fill at thine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in THY vessel .
if a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel , and maketh merchandise of him , or selleth him ; then that thief shall die ; and thou shalt put evil away from among you .
take heed in the plague of leprosy , that thou observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them , so ye shall observe to do .
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
when thou gatherest the grapes of THY vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
how he met thee by the way , and smote the hindmost of thee , even all that were feeble behind thee , when thou wast faint and weary ; and he feared not God .
and now , behold , I have brought the firstfruits of the land , which thou , O Lord , hast given me . and thou shalt set it before the Lord THY God , and worship before the Lord THY God :
and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord THY God hath given unto thee , and unto thine house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger that is among you .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaister them with plaister :
blessed shall be the fruit of THY body , and the fruit of THY ground , and the fruit of THY cattle , the increase of THY kine , and the flocks of THY sheep .
and all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord ; and they shall be afraid of thee .
the Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt , and with the emerods , and with the scab , and with the itch , whereof thou canst not be healed .
Thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
THY sons and THY daughters shall be given unto another people , and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in thine hand .
the Lord shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that cannot be healed , from the sole of THY foot unto the top of THY head .
if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name , the Lord THY God ;
then the Lord will make THY plagues wonderful , and the plagues of THY seed , even great plagues , and of long continuance , and sore sicknesses , and of long continuance .
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of THY foot have rest : but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
these are the words of the Covenant , which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , beside the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
and Moses called unto all Israel , and said unto them , Ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh , and unto all his servants , and unto all his land ;
then men shall say , Because they have forsaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven , from thence will the Lord THY God gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
and the Lord THY God will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of THY seed , to love the Lord THY God with all thine heart , and with all THY soul , that thou mayest live .
I denounce unto you this day , that ye shall surely perish , and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land , whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it .
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the Lord hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
the Lord THY God , he will go over before thee , and he will destroy these nations from before thee , and thou shalt possess them : and Joshua , he shall go over before thee , as the Lord hath said .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi , which bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , and unto all the elders of Israel .
when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord THY God in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
and I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought , in that they are turned unto other gods .
and it came to pass , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
he made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ;
I will make mine arrows drunk with blood , and my sword shall devour flesh ; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives , from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy .
and die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto THY people ; as Aaron THY brother died in mount Hor , and was gathered unto his people :
because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah @-@ Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
they shall call the people unto the mountain ; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness : for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas , and of treasures hid in the sand .
and Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho . and the Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead , unto Dan ,
now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass , that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun , Moses ' minister , saying ,
from the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : whither the men went I wot not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall overtake them .
but she had brought them up to the roof of the house , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order upon the roof .
and they commanded the people , saying , When ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God , and the priests the Levites bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
and Joshua spake unto the priests , saying , Take up the Ark of the Covenant , and pass over before the people . and they took up the Ark of the Covenant , and went before the people .
now all the people that came out were circumcised : but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circumcised .
and it came to pass , when they had done circumcising all the people , that they abode in their places in the camp , till they were whole .
and ye , in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing , lest ye make yourselves accursed , when ye take of the accursed thing , and make the camp of Israel a curse , and trouble it .
and they burnt the city with fire , and all that was therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord .
and Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive , and her father 's household , and all that she had ; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day ; because she hid the messengers , which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
and they took them out of the midst of the tent , and brought them unto Joshua , and unto all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up against AI : and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour , and sent them away by night .
( for they will come out after us ) till we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do . see , I have commanded you .
and all the people that were in AI were called together to pursue after them : and they pursued after Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and it is mouldy :
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they dwelt among them .
and it came to pass , when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter , till they were consumed , that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the plains south of Chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the borders of Dor on the west ,
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude , with horses and chariots very many .
them did Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smite : and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
from Aroer , that is upon the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon ;
and their coast was from Aroer , that is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by Medeba ;
and the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan , and the border thereof . this was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families , the cities and the villages thereof .
and Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh : and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families .
forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh @-@ barnea to espy out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families ; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast .
and the border went up to Beth @-@ hogla , and passed along by the north of Beth @-@ arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of mount Ephron ; and the border was drawn to Baalah , which is Kirjath @-@ jearim :
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth @-@ shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
and the west border was to the great sea , and the coast thereof . this is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families .
and goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti , unto the coast of Beth @-@ horon the nether , and to Gezer : and the goings out thereof are at the sea .
and the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus : even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth @-@ addar , unto Beth @-@ horon the upper ;
and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath @-@ shiloh , and passed by it on the east to Janohah ;
the border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah ; and the goings out thereof were at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families .
southward it was Ephraim 's , and northward it was Manasseh 's , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in Asher on the north , and in Issachar on the east .
yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were waxen strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute ; but did not utterly drive them out .
and Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
and the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh , and set up the tabernacle of the Congregation there . and the land was subdued before them .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Judah shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north .
and the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families : and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @-@ shemesh , and went forth toward Geliloth , which is over against the going up of Adummim , and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
and the border passed along to the side of Beth @-@ hoglah northward : and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan : this was the south coast .
and the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , and out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh , ten cities .
the children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben , and out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun , twelve cities .
and they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi , had : for theirs was the first lot .
thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the Slayer ; and Libnah with her suburbs ,
and the families of the children of Kohath , the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim .
and unto the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with her suburbs , and Kartah with her suburbs ,
and when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up to war against them .
and they came unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , unto the land of Gilead , and they spake with them , saying ,
that we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offerings thereon , let the Lord himself require it ;
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak unto our children , saying , What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
and the Lord your God , he shall expel them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall possess their land , as the Lord your God hath promised unto you .
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses , that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left ;
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
for the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day .
and it came to pass after these things , that Joshua the son of nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem , and had taken it , and smitten it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
and when he shewed them the entrance into the city , they smote the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let go the man and all his family .
and the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain : for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley :
and it came to pass , when the angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord , that he did for Israel .
Whithersoever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for evil , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworn unto them : and they were greatly distressed .
and when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord .
and Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlour , which he had for himself alone . and Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . and he arose out of his seat .
and they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , all lusty , and all men of valour ; and there escaped not a man .
and Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon .
and the Lord discomfited Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his host , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
but Barak pursued after the chariots , and after the host , unto Harosheth of the Gentiles : and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword ; and there was not a man left .
and the hand of the children of Israel prospered , and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek ; after thee , Benjamin , among THY people ; out of Machir came down governors , and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
she put her hand to the nail , and her right hand to the workmen 's hammer ; and with the hammer she smote Sisera , she smote off his head , when she had pierced and stricken through his temples .
and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel : and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and caves , and strong holds .
and so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all that oppressed you , and drave them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and build an altar unto the Lord THY God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host . then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
and the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after the Midianites .
thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon .
and it came to pass , as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and went a whoring after Baalim , and made Baal @-@ berith their god .
and the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side :
and Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother 's brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sincerely , in that ye have made Abimelech king , and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands ;
and Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people that were with him , from lying in wait .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and thither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and gat them up to the top of the tower .
and Abimelech came unto the tower , and fought against it , and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines , and into the hands of the children of Ammon .
then Jephthah fled from his brethren , and dwelt in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah , and went out with him .
and it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob :
then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead , and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon .
and she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my fellows .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand , and called that place Ramath @-@ lehi .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his soul was vexed unto death ;
but the Philistines took him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he did grind in the prison house .
and when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , which slew many of us .
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war , which were of the children of Dan , stood by the entering of the gate .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel : howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first .
but the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , his concubine also was with him .
and when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said unto his master , Come , I pray thee , and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it .
and , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount Ephraim ; and he sojourned in Gibeah : but the men of the place were Benjamites .
and the chief of all the people , even of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword .
but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
and the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
and the liers in wait hasted , and rushed upon Gibeah ; and the liers in wait drew themselves along , and smote all the city with the edge of the sword .
but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them , and , behold , the flame of the city ascended up to heaven .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness ; but the battle overtook them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them .
and they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh @-@ gilead four hundred young virgins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
and the children of Israel departed thence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance .
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah .
and she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed .
Wherefore it came to pass , when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived , that she bare a son , and called his name Samuel , saying , Because I have asked him of the Lord .
now Eli was very old , and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel ; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
behold , the days come , that I will cut off thine arm , and the arm of THY father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
and it came to pass at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place , and his eyes began to wax dim , that he could not see ;
and when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow , behold , Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the Ark of the Lord . and they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
and they of Beth @-@ shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley : and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ark , and rejoiced to see it .
and these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the Lord ; for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Askelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ;
and the men of Kirjath @-@ jearim came , and fetched up the Ark of the Lord , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the Ark of the Lord .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines .
and the Lord said unto Samuel , Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
and he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your oliveyards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Bechorath , the son of Aphiah , a Benjamite , a mighty man of power .
and when they were come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant that was with him , Come , and let us return ; lest my father leave caring for the asses , and take thought for us .
( Beforetime in Israel , when a man went to inquire of God , thus he spake , Come , and let us go to the seer : for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer . )
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , behold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
and Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the parlour , and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden , which were about thirty persons .
when he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Matri was taken , and Saul the son of Kish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the Lord . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
when Jacob was come into Egypt , and your fathers cried unto the Lord , then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron , which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
but if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fathers .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might salute him .
and the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah , unto the land of Shual :
and that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armourbearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half acre of land , which a yoke of oxen might plow .
and Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves , and they came to the battle : and , behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow , and there was a very great discomfiture .
moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan .
likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slew them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam , the daughter of Ahimaaz : and the name of the captain of his host was Abner , the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
and he had an helmet of brass upon his head , and he was armed with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
and the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next unto him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine , and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
then the princes of the Philistines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul ; so that his name was much set by .
and Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
but also thou shalt not cut off THY kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth .
and when thou hast stayed three days , then thou shalt go down quickly , and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand , and shalt remain by the stone Ezel .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jonathan arose , and Abner sat by Saul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little lad with him .
now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before the Lord ; and his name was Doeg , an Edomite , the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul .
then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah , saying , Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of Jeshimon ?
and it came to pass , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , behold , David is in the wilderness of En @-@ gedi .
so David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Saul . but Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me : forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand , thou killedst me not .
swear now therefore unto me by the Lord , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was Shearing his sheep in Carmel .
and now I have heard that thou hast shearers : now THY shepherds which were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there ought missing unto them , all the while they were in Carmel .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers , and give it unto men , whom I know not whence they be ?
and when Abigail saw David , she hasted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground ,
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and Abigail hasted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
and Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon , by the way . but David abode in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea , as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains .
and , behold , as THY life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
and David dwelt with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . and Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
now therefore , I pray thee , hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before thee ; and eat , that thou mayest have strength , when thou goest on THY way .
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with THY master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
so David and his men came to the city , and , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captives .
then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
and they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he did eat ; and they made him drink water ;
now it came to pass after the death of Saul , when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had abode two days in Ziklag ;
and they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
( also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jasher . )
and the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . and they told David , saying , That the men of Jabesh @-@ gilead were they that buried Saul .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh @-@ gilead , and said unto them , blessed be ye of the Lord , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : wherefore that place was called Helkath @-@ hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
and it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul .
and Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
so David would not remove the Ark of the Lord unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ edom the Gittite .
and as the Ark of the Lord came into the city of David , Michal Saul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord ; and she despised him in her heart .
whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of THY sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
and when THY days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with THY fathers , I will set up THY seed after thee , which shall proceed out of THY bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
when Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians :
and it came to pass in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Joab , and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
and if so be that the king 's wrath arise , and he say unto thee , Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were virgins apparelled . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom hath slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
but Absalom fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
and all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , six hundred men which came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
and all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Brook Kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he worshipped God , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head :
and hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king 's house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz Zadok 's son , and Jonathan Abiathar 's son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed , and will make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and I will smite the king only :
and he also that is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt : for all Israel knoweth that THY father is a mighty man , and they which be with him are valiant men .
and Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab : which Amasa was a man 's son , whose name was Ithra an Israelite , that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah Joab 's mother .
for THY servant doth know that I have sinned : therefore , behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
and there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men : and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
and there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines , where Elhanan the son of Jaare @-@ oregim , a Bethlehemite , slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
and the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the rebuking of the Lord , at the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth , I did stamp them as the mire of the street , and did spread them abroad .
and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies : thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
now these be the last words of David . David the son of Jesse said , and the man who was raised up on high , the anointed of the God of Jacob , and the sweet psalmist of Israel , said ,
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun riseth , even a morning without clouds ; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain .
and after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite . and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam : and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim .
and Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spear against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
and Araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men which belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
and they told the king , saying , behold Nathan the prophet . and when he was come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
and all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
so Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the Lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord , which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
then tidings came to Joab : for Joab had turned after Adonijah , though he turned not after Absalom . and Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
for it shall be , that on the day thou goest out , and passest over the Brook Kidron , thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die : THY blood shall be upon thine own head .
and I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all THY days .
Baana the son of Ahilud ; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth @-@ shean , which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel , from Beth @-@ shean to Abel @-@ meholah , even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam :
Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead , in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river , from Tiphsah even to Azzah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
beside the chief of Solomon 's officers which were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled over the people that wrought in the work .
and the house which king Solomon built for the Lord , the length thereof was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits , and the height thereof thirty cubits .
and the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubits was the length thereof , according to the breadth of the house ; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house .
and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temple and of the oracle : and he made chambers round about :
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in the height thereof : and he overlaid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of cedar .
and the whole house he overlaid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold .
and he made a porch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits : and the porch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
and he made two chapiters of molten brass , to set upon the tops of the pillars : the height of the one chapiter was five cubits , and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits :
and nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ; seven for the one chapiter , and seven for the other chapiter .
and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above , over against the belly which was by the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter .
and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called the name thereof Jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and he called the name thereof Boaz .
and he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cubits : and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
and under the borders were four wheels ; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base : and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit .
and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their axletrees , and their naves , and their felloes , and their spokes , were all molten .
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
for on the plates of the ledges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he graved cherubims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basons : and all these vessels , which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the Lord , were of bright brass .
and they brought up the Ark of the Lord , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , even those did the priests and the Levites bring up .
and king Solomon , and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled unto him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and oxen , that could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
and they drew out the staves , that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day .
and I have set there a place for the Ark , wherein is the Covenant of the Lord , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
who hast kept with THY servant David my father that thou promisedst him : thou spakest also with THY mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of THY servant , and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer , which THY servant prayeth before thee to day :
( for they shall hear of THY great name , and of THY strong hand , and of THY stretched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
if THY people go out to battle against their enemy , whithersoever thou shalt send them , and shall pray unto the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house that I have built for THY name :
and forgive THY people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee , and give them compassion before them who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them :
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of THY servant , and unto the supplication of THY people Israel , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee .
blessed be the Lord , that hath given rest unto his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant .
and it came to pass , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
then I will establish the throne of THY kingdom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David THY father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel .
and at this house , which is high , every one that passeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land , and to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ,
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
for Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy , upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day .

Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people ; for the cause was from the Lord , that he might perform his saying , which the Lord spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the tribute ; and all Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
the altar also was rent , and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .

and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcase was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the carcase .
and , behold , men passed by , and saw the carcase cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcase : and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .

how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put THY trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rab @-@ shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spake , saying , Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria :

now therefore , O Lord our God , I beseech thee , save thou us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God , even thou only .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted THY voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which THY fathers have laid up in store unto this day , shall be carried into Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the Lord .
and of THY sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , after the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .

and Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . and Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .

and the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Michaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asahiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read :
but to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , As touching the words which thou hast heard ;

and the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and it came to pass after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines ; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai , that was of the children of the giant : and they were subdued .
then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
and as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshingfloor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
then shalt thou prosper , if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dread not , nor be dismayed .
now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
so the number of them , with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the Lord , even all that were cunning , was two hundred fourscore and eight .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons ; Simri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him the chief ; )
which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fathers , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the host , had dedicated .
and over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the storehouses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the castles , was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah :
and of all my sons , ( for the Lord hath given me many sons , ) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel .
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims , that spread out their wings , and covered the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord .
both riches and honour come of thee , and thou reignest over all ; and in thine hand is power and might ; and in thine hand it is to make great , and to give strength unto all .
and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep THY commandments , THY testimonies , and THY statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
then Solomon spake unto all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
so Solomon , and all the Congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of the Congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness .
but the Ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath @-@ jearim to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the brasen altar , that Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , he put before the tabernacle of the Lord : and Solomon and the Congregation sought unto it .
and Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel , after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them ; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount Moriah , where the Lord appeared unto David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the posts , and the walls thereof , and the doors thereof , with gold ; and graved cherubims on the walls .
and he made chains , as in the oracle , and put them on the heads of the pillars ; and made an hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and five cubits the height thereof ; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
and under it was the similitude of oxen , which did compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about . two rows of oxen were cast , when it was cast .
and the thickness of it was an handbreadth , and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies ; and it received and held three thousand baths .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred basons of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid the doors of them with brass .
and they brought up the Ark , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , these did the priests and the Levites bring up .
also king Solomon , and all the Congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the Ark , sacrificed sheep and oxen , which could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
and it came to pass , when the priests were come out of the holy place : ( for all the priests that were present were sanctified , and did not then wait by course :
but the Lord said to David my father , Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name , thou didst well in that it was in thine heart :
Thou which hast kept with THY servant David my father that which thou hast promised him ; and spakest with THY mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man , or of all THY people Israel , when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief , and shall spread forth his hands in this house :
then hear thou from heaven THY dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men : )
if THY people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them , and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I have built for THY name ;
and as for thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as David THY father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statues and my judgments ;
and this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , wherein Solomon had built the house of the Lord , and his own house ,
as for all the people that were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which were not of Israel ,
but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him , and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute ; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . but king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
and when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem , he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest 's office unto the Lord :
and it came to pass , when Rehoboam had established the kingdom , and had strengthened himself , he forsook the law of the Lord , and all Israel with him .
ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a Covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord .
and when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind : and they cried unto the Lord , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it came to pass , that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out , nor to him that came in , but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
and he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
then ASA was wroth with the seer , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . and ASA oppressed some of the people the same time .
and they taught in Judah , and had the book of the law of the Lord with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught the people .
for it came to pass , that , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
and the battle increased that day : howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died .
then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph , came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the Congregation ;
to morrow go ye down against them : behold , they come up by the cliff of Ziz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the Brook , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
and the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites , and of the children of the Korhites , stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah ; for there they blessed the Lord : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Berachah , unto this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
and the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries , when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel .
and Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father , he strengthened himself , and slew all his brethren with the sword , and divers also of the princes of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of Ahab : for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife : and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord .
and it came to pass , that , when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab , and found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah , that ministered to Ahaziah , he slew them .
and they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the chief of the fathers of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
this is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you entering on the sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be porters of the doors ;
moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king David 's , which were in the house of God .
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king 's house , they slew her there .
then all the people went to the house of Baal , and brake it down , and brake his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
for the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon Baalim .
now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father .
then Amaziah separated them , to wit , the army that was come to him out of Ephraim , to go home again : wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in great anger .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
so Joash the king of Israel went up ; and they saw one another in the face , both he and Amaziah king of Judah , at Beth @-@ shemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
and he sought God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him to prosper .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord , like David his father :
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
and the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the princes , and gave it unto the king of Assyria : but he helped him not .
and Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem : but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old , and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
and Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar . and when the burnt offering began , the song of the Lord began also with the trumpets , and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel .
and they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the Brook Kidron .
then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord .
for there were many in the Congregation that were not sanctified : therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean , to sanctify them unto the Lord .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the Lord .
and all the Congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the Congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
and he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and spake comfortably to them , saying ,
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to affright them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
and Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour : and he made himself treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all manner of pleasant jewels ;
but did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , like unto the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
but he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as did Manasseh his father : for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them ;
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house :
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses .
and the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah :
and as for the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of the Lord , so shall ye say unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard ;
and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the Levites .
and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance : but the other holy offerings sod they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and divided them speedily among all the people .
and when the year was expired , king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
and the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers , rising up betimes , and sending ; because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
and all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes ; all these he brought to Babylon .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , beside all that was willingly offered .
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all an hundred thirty and nine .
and of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai ; which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name :
and some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
now when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
but the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to Darius : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the copy of the letter that Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar @-@ boznai , and his companions the Apharsachites , which were on this side the river , sent unto Darius the king :
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
then came the same Sheshbazzar , and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now hath it been in building , and yet it is not finished .
and there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of the Medes , a roll , and therein was a record thus written :
and they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
and there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , unto Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest , the scribe , even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the Lord , and of his statutes to Israel .
Artaxerxes , king of kings , unto Ezra the priest , a scribe of the law of the God of heaven , perfect peace , and at such a time .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Levites , in my realm , which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem :
and whatsoever shall seem good to thee , and to THY brethren , to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do after the will of your God .
and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of THY God , which thou shalt have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king 's treasure house .
whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven : for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
of the sons of Shechaniah , of the sons of Pharosh ; Zechariah : and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty .
so took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God .
and when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down astonied .
and at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees , and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren ; Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
that Hanani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
and it came to pass , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days , and fasted , and prayed before the God of heaven ,
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
and next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah , the son of Koz . and next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabeel . and next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana .
moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah , and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah ; they laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , and the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
and next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite , and Jadon the Meronothite , the men of Gibeon , and of Mizpah , unto the throne of the governor on this side the river .
the valley gate repaired Hanun , and the inhabitants of Zanoah ; they built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof , and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the Dung gate .
Palal the son of Uzai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which lieth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh .
but it came to pass , that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall , he was wroth , and took great indignation , and mocked the Jews .
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
they which builded on the wall , and they that bare burdens , with those that laded , every one with one of his hands wrought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
for the builders , every one had his sword girded by his side , and so builded . and he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers , beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us .
therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
and of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai , which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife , and was called after their name .
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people , the priests , and the Levites , unto Ezra the scribe , even to understand the words of the law .
and they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they confessed , and worshipped the Lord their God .
and thou didst divide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way wherein they should go .
their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven , and broughtest them into the land , concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept THY law , nor hearkened unto THY commandments and THY testimonies , wherewith thou didst testify against them .
for they have not served thee in their kingdom , and in THY great Goodness that thou gavest them , and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them , neither turned they from their wicked works .
and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins : also they have dominion over our bodies , and over our cattle , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch , the son of Col @-@ hozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of Shiloni .
and these are the sons of Benjamin ; Sallu the son of Meshullam , the son of Joed , the son of Pedaiah , the son of Kolaiah , the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ithiel , the son of Jesaiah .
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , was the ruler of the house of God .
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and Amashai the son of Azareel , the son of Ahasai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
and their brethren , mighty men of valour , an hundred twenty and eight : and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of one of the great men .
the sons of Levi , the chief of the fathers , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the Dung gate :
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets ; namely , Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Michaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph :
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the Congregation of God for ever ;
and I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them : for the Levites and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
there dwelt men of Tyre also therein , which brought fish , and all manner of ware , and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
then I testified against them , and said unto them , Why lodge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath .
now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus , ( this is Ahasuerus which reigned , from India even unto Ethiopia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces : )
that in those days , when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great , ) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
then thus came every maiden unto the king ; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king 's house .
in those days , while Mordecai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's chamberlains , Bigthan and Teresh , of those which kept the door , were wroth , and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus .
and when Inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both hanged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bowed , and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
and he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone ; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai : wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even the people of Mordecai .
when Mordecai perceived all that was done , Mordecai rent his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and cried with a loud and a bitter cry ;
so Esther 's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her . then was the queen exceedingly grieved ; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him : but he received it not .
then called Esther for Hatach , one of the king 's chamberlains , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a commandment to Mordecai , to know what it was , and why it was .
then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of indignation against Mordecai .
and Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
on that night could not the king sleep , and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles ; and they were read before the king .
then Esther the queen answered and said , If I have found favour in THY sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
and Esther spake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
and he wrote in the king Ahasuerus ' name , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on horseback , and riders on mules , camels , and young dromedaries :
and Parshandatha , and Dalphon , and Aspatha ,
for the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and slew three hundred men at Shushan ; but on the prey they laid not their hand .
but when Esther came before the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he devised against the Jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
and his sons went and feasted in their houses , every one his day ; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the dawning of the day :
for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come unto me .
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field : and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee .
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ? for now shall I sleep in the dust ; and thou shalt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
if I be wicked , woe unto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine affliction ;
he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease .
Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly unto all my paths ; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet .
that which he laboured for shall he restore , and shall not swallow it down : according to his substance shall the restitution be , and he shall not rejoice therein .
when he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating .
on the left hand , where he doth work , but I cannot behold him : he hideth himself on the right hand , that I cannot see him :
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terrors of the shadow of death .
if my step hath turned out of the way , and mine heart walked after mine eyes , and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands ;
then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite , of the kindred of Ram : against Job was his wrath kindled , because he justified himself rather than God .
let me not , I pray you , accept any man 's person , neither let me give flattering titles unto man .
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous : but with kings are they on the throne ; yea , he doth establish them for ever , and they are exalted .
even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place , where there is no straitness ; and that which should be set on THY table should be full of fatness .
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water , that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; his leaf also shall not wither ; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper .
but as for me , I will come into THY house in the multitude of THY mercy : and in THY fear will I worship toward THY holy temple .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou defendest them : let them also that love THY name be joyful in thee .
if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me ; ( yea , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy : )
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den : he lieth in wait to catch the poor : he doth catch the poor , when he draweth him into his net .
Shew THY marvellous lovingkindness , O thou that savest by THY right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them .
the Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my buckler , and the Horn of my salvation , and my high tower .
in my distress I called upon the Lord , and cried unto my God : he heard my voice out of his temple , and my cry came before him , even into his ears .
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people ; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
he delivereth me from mine enemies : yea , thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
his going forth is from the end of the heaven , and his circuit unto the ends of it : and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof .
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon THY strings against the face of them .
I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint : my heart is like wax ; it is melted in the midst of my bowels .
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
rest in the Lord , and wait patiently for him : fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way , because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass .
for yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : yea , thou shalt diligently consider his place , and it shall not be .
I have not hid THY righteousness within my heart ; I have declared THY faithfulness and THY salvation : I have not concealed THY lovingkindness and THY truth from the great Congregation .
for innumerable evils have compassed me about : mine iniquities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the hairs of mine head : therefore my heart faileth me .
the Lord will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be blessed upon the earth : and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies .
Yea , mine own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , which did eat of my bread , hath lifted up his heel against me .
yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the God of my life .
he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth ; he breaketh the bow , and cutteth the spear in sunder ; he burneth the chariot in the fire .
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever , he shall take thee away , and pluck thee out of THY dwelling place , and root thee out of the land of the living . Selah .
be merciful unto me , O God , be merciful unto me : for my soul trusteth in thee : yea , in the shadow of THY wings will I make my refuge , until these calamities be overpast .
my soul is among lions : and I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves . Selah .
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea :
the chariots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of angels : the Lord is among them , as in Sinai , in the holy place .
to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens , which were of old ; lo , he doth send out his voice , and that a mighty voice .
they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mine enemies wrongfully , are mighty : then I restored that which I took not away .
but as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O Lord , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of THY mercy hear me , in the truth of THY salvation .
reproach hath broken my heart ; and I am full of heaviness : and I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none .
by thee have I been holden up from the womb : thou art he that took me out of my mother 's bowels : my praise shall be continually of thee .
now also when I am old and grayheaded , O God , forsake me not ; until I have shewed THY strength unto this generation , and THY power to every one that is to come .
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth .
we will not hide them from their children , shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord , and his strength , and his wonderful works that he hath done .
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation ; a generation that set not their heart aright , and whose spirit was not stedfast with God .
but he , being full of compassion , forgave their iniquity , and destroyed them not : yea , many a time turned he his anger away , and did not stir up all his wrath .
the dead bodies of THY servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven , the flesh of THY saints unto the beasts of the earth .
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me ; thou hast made me an abomination unto them : I am shut up , and I cannot come forth .
and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us : and establish thou the work of our hands upon us ; yea , the work of our hands establish thou it .
the Lord reigneth , he is clothed with majesty ; the Lord is clothed with strength , wherewith he hath girded himself : the world also is stablished , that it cannot be moved .
the Lord hath been mindful of us : he will bless us ; he will bless the house of Israel ; he will bless the house of Aaron .
though I walk in the midst of trouble , thou wilt revive me : thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies , and THY right hand shall save me .
Thine eyes did see my substance , yet being unperfect ; and in THY book all my members were written , which in continuance were fashioned , when as yet there was none of them .
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me , then thou knewest my path . in the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me .
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul ; he hath smitten my life down to the ground ; he hath made me to dwell in darkness , as those that have been long dead .
cause me to hear THY lovingkindness in the morning ; for in thee do I trust : cause me to know the way wherein I should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto thee .
when thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid : yea , thou shalt lie down , and THY sleep shall be sweet .
the fear of the Lord tendeth to life : and he that hath it shall abide satisfied ; he shall not be visited with evil .
Yea , thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea , or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast .
and , lo , it was all grown over with thorns , and nettles had covered the face thereof , and the stone wall thereof was broken down .
if thine enemy be hungry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thirsty , give him water to drink :
Thine own friend , and THY father 's friend , forsake not ; neither go into THY brother 's house in the day of THY calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
there is a generation , whose teeth are as swords , and their jaw teeth as knives , to devour the poor from off the earth , and the needy from among men .
the way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maid .
and I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven : this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith .
and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured , and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun . this is also vanity .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but woe to him that is alone when he falleth ; for he hath not another to help him up .
be not rash with THY mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God : for God is in heaven , and thou upon earth : therefore let THY words be few .
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners thereof , saving the beholding of them with their eyes ?
as he came forth of his mother 's womb , naked shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
all things have I seen in the days of my vanity : there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness .
it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from this withdraw not thine hand : for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all .
I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom , and the reason of things , and to know the wickedness of Folly , even of foolishness and madness :
which yet my soul seeketh , but I find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all those have I not found .
and so I saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the holy , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also vanity .
when I applied mine heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done upon the earth : ( for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes : )
also their love , and their hatred , and their envy , is now perished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
Yea also , when he that is a fool walketh by the way , his wisdom faileth him , and he saith to every one that he is a fool .
if the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child : even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be darkened ,
and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the grinding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low ;
or ever the silver cord be loosed , or the golden bowl be broken , or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , or the wheel broken at the cistern .
if thou know not , O thou fairest among women , go THY way forth by the footsteps of the flock , and feed THY kids beside the shepherds ' tents .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
the flowers appear on the earth ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land ;
I will rise now , and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth : I sought him , but I found him not .
he made the pillars thereof of silver , the bottom thereof of gold , the covering of it of purple , the midst thereof being paved with love , for the daughters of Jerusalem .
go forth , O ye daughters of Zion , and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals , and in the day of the gladness of his heart .
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , I will get me to the mountain of myrrh , and to the hill of frankincense .
THY neck is as a tower of Ivory ; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon , by the gate of Bath @-@ rabbim : THY nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus .
O that thou wert as my brother , that sucked the breasts of my mother ! when I should find thee without , I would kiss thee ; yea , I should not be despised .
I would lead thee , and bring thee into my mother 's house , who would instruct me : I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate .
from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it ; but wounds , and bruises , and putrifying sores : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither mollified with ointment .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots :
the lofty looks of man shall be humbled , and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down , and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low : and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
and they shall go into the holes of the rocks , and into the caves of the earth , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
and it shall come to pass , that he that is left in Zion , and he that remaineth in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem :
when the Lord shall have washed away the Filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my vineyard , that I have not done in it ? wherefore , when I looked that it should bring forth grapes , brought it forth wild grapes ?
and the harp , and the viol , the tabret , and pipe , and wine , are in their feasts : but they regard not the work of the Lord , neither consider the operation of his hands .
and the mean man shall be brought down , and the mighty man shall be humbled , and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled :
that say , Let him make speed , and hasten his work , that we may see it : and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come , that we may know it !
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far , and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
none shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken :
their roaring shall be like a lion , they shall roar like young lions : yea , they shall roar , and lay hold of the prey , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
and say unto him , Take heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands , for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria , and of the son of Remaliah .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thorns , and upon all bushes .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings , it shall even be for briers and thorns .
for the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
and he shall be for a sanctuary ; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel , for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and they shall pass through it , hardly bestead and hungry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hungry , they shall fret themselves , and curse their king and their God , and look upward .
and what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your glory ?
and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame : and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day ;
and it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off THY shoulder , and his yoke from off THY neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing .
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither reprove after the hearing of his ears :
and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse , which shall stand for an ensign of the people ; to it shall the Gentiles seek : and his rest shall be glorious .
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west ; they shall spoil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab ; and the children of Ammon shall obey them .
for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light : the sun shall be darkened in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to shine .
and it shall be as the chased roe , and as a sheep that no man taketh up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb ; their eye shall not spare children .
and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses , and dragons in their pleasant palaces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prolonged .
for the Lord will have mercy on Jacob , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land : and the strangers shall be joined with them , and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob .
rejoice not thou , whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent 's root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent .
and Heshbon shall cry , and Elealeh : their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz : therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out ; his life shall be grievous unto him .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
and he shall not look to the altars , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fingers have made , either the groves , or the images .
Woe to the multitude of many people , which make a noise like the noise of the seas ; and to the rushing of nations , that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters !
for afore the harvest , when the bud is perfect , and the sour grape is ripening in the flower , he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks , and take away and cut down the branches .
and they shall turn the rivers far away ; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up : the reeds and flags shall wither .
in that day shall Egypt be like unto women : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which he shaketh over it .
and the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt , every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself , because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts , which he hath determined against it .
and the Lord shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and oblation ; yea , they shall vow a vow unto the Lord , and perform it .
therefore are my loins filled with pain : pangs have taken hold upon me , as the pangs of a woman that travaileth : I was bowed down at the hearing of it ; I was dismayed at the seeing of it .
and it shall come to pass , that THY choicest valleys shall be full of chariots , and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate .
and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , all vessels of small quantity , from the vessels of cups , even to all the vessels of flagons .
he stretched out his hand over the sea , he shook the kingdoms : the Lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city , to destroy the strong holds thereof .
when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree , and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the earth upon the earth .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers , as the heat in a dry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud : the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low .
and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
he will swallow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces ; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth : for the Lord hath spoken it .
and the fortress of the high Fort of THY walls shall he bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the dust .
with my soul have I desired thee in the night ; yea , with my spirit within me will I seek thee early : for when THY judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness .
let favour be shewed to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly , and will not behold the majesty of the Lord .
we have been with child , we have been in pain , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter thou into THY chambers , and shut THY doors about thee : hide thyself as it were for a little moment , until the indignation be overpast .
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin ; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff , and the cummin with a rod .
moreover the multitude of THY strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away : yea , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity , and out of darkness .
but when he seeth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sanctify my name , and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
for the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem : thou shalt weep no more : he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of THY cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer thee .
and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
Ye shall defile also the covering of THY Graven images of silver , and the ornament of THY molten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
yet he also is wise , and will bring evil , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of them that work iniquity .
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which your own hands have made unto you for a sin .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
Thou shalt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive ; of a stammering tongue , that thou canst not understand .
their slain also shall be cast out , and their stink shall come up out of their carcases , and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
it shall not be quenched night nor day ; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it ; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion , and the stones of emptiness .
the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island , and the satyr shall cry to his fellow ; the screech owl also shall rest there , and find for herself a place of rest .
I say , sayest thou , ( but they are but vain words ) I have counsel and strength for war : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on THY part to set riders upon them .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put THY trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
and it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the Lord .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not THY God , in whom thou trustest , deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed , as Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Telassar ?
and Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted THY voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
then the angel of the Lord went forth , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
behold , for peace I had great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sins behind THY back .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which THY fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the Lord .
and of THY sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
he shall feed his flock like a shepherd : he shall gather the lambs with his arm , and carry them in his bosom , and shall gently lead those that are with young .
behold , the nations are as a drop of a bucket , and are counted as the small dust of the balance : behold , he taketh up the isles as a very little thing .
it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers ; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain , and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in :
Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth , and called thee from the chief men thereof , and said unto thee , Thou art my servant ; I have chosen thee , and not cast thee away .
Thou shalt seek them , and shalt not find them , even them that contended with thee : they that war against thee shall be as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
Thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers in high places , and fountains in the midst of the valleys : I will make the wilderness a pool of water , and the dry land springs of water .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon morter , and as the Potter treadeth clay .
for I beheld , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no counseller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that Kedar doth inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
the Lord shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , yea , roar ; he shall prevail against his enemies .
Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of THY sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with THY sins , thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities .
I will go before thee , and make the crooked places straight : I will break in pieces the gates of brass , and cut in sunder the bars of iron :
and I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou mayest know that I , the Lord , which call thee by THY name , am the God of Israel .
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none beside me . I am the Lord , and there is none else .
and thou saidst , I shall be a lady for ever : so that thou didst not lay these things to THY heart , neither didst remember the latter end of it .
I have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of my mouth , and I shewed them ; I did them suddenly , and they came to pass .
Yea , thou heardest not ; yea , thou knewest not ; yea , from that time that thine ear was not opened : for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously , and wast called a transgressor from the womb .
and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he clave the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
listen , O isles , unto me ; and hearken , ye people , from far ; The Lord hath called me from the womb ; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name .
the children which thou shalt have , after thou hast lost the other , shall say again in thine ears , The place is too strait for me : give place to me that I may dwell .
for the Lord God will help me ; therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore have I set my face like a Flint , and I know that I shall not be ashamed .
who is among you that feareth the Lord , that obeyeth the voice of his servant , that walketh in darkness , and hath no light ? let him trust in the name of the Lord , and stay upon his God .
art thou not it which hath dried the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over ?
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth ; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up .
the Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God .
for ye shall not go out with haste , nor go by flight : for the Lord will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rereward .
so shall he sprinkle many nations ; the kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
he was oppressed , and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his mouth : he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he openeth not his mouth .
for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left ; and THY seed shall inherit the Gentiles , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
for the mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the Covenant of my peace be removed , saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee .
behold , thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not , and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord THY God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hath glorified thee .
so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it .
Yea , they are greedy dogs which can never have enough , and they are shepherds that cannot understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
Wherefore have we fasted , say they , and thou seest not ? wherefore have we afflicted our soul , and thou takest no knowledge ? behold , in the day of your fast ye find pleasure , and exact all your labours .
behold , ye fast for strife and debate , and to smite with the fist of wickedness : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
then shall THY light break forth as the morning , and thine health shall spring forth speedily : and THY righteousness shall go before thee ; the glory of the Lord shall be THY rereward .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
for he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and an helmet of salvation upon his head ; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeal as a cloke .
the sun shall be no more THY light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee : but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light , and THY God THY glory .
THY sun shall no more go down ; neither shall THY moon withdraw itself : for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light , and the days of THY mourning shall be ended .
but ye shall be named the priests of the Lord : men shall call you the Ministers of our God : ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles , and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves .
for Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth .
and I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me ; and my fury , it upheld me .
but we are all as an unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags ; and we all do fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , like the wind , have taken us away .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , behold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
and I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
and I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , who have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , and worshipped the works of their own hands .
Hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken the Lord THY God , when he led thee by the way ?
a wild ass used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
but where are THY gods that thou hast made thee ? let them arise , if they can save thee in the time of THY trouble : for according to the number of THY cities are THY gods , O Judah .
in those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers .
and now , because ye have done all these works , saith the Lord , and I spake unto you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answered not ;
for I spake not unto your fathers , nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them ; but they will not hearken to thee : thou shalt also call unto them ; but they will not answer thee .
Yea , the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times ; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord .
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they be all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
for death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our palaces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
for the customs of the people are vain : for one cutteth a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman , with the axe .
silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the work of the workman , and of the hands of the founder : blue and purple is their clothing : they are all the work of cunning men .
but the Lord is the true God , he is the living God , and an everlasting king : at his wrath the earth shall tremble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation .
my tabernacle is spoiled , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
for according to the number of THY cities were THY gods , O Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing , even altars to burn incense unto Baal .
the Lord called THY name , A green olive tree , fair , and of goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
for even THY brethren , and the house of THY father , even they have dealt treacherously with thee ; yea , they have called a multitude after thee : believe them not , though they speak fair words unto thee .
the spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness : for the sword of the Lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh shall have peace .
and it shall come to pass , after that I have plucked them out I will return , and have compassion on them , and will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
then I went to Euphrates , and digged , and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it : and , behold , the girdle was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
the cities of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open them : Judah shall be carried away captive all of it , it shall be wholly carried away captive .
and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the pits , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were ashamed and confounded , and covered their heads .
and I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will bereave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
for thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that bare them , and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land ;
and ye have done worse than your fathers ; for , behold , ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart , that they may not hearken unto me :
the sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it is Graven upon the table of their heart , and upon the horns of your altars ;
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good cometh ; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
as the partridge sitteth on eggs , and hatcheth them not ; so he that getteth riches , and not by right , shall leave them in the midst of his days , and at his end shall be a fool .
O Lord , the hope of Israel , all that forsake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken the Lord , the fountain of living waters .
and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter : so he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the Potter to make it .
if that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them .
and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is by the entry of the east gate , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee ,
then came Jeremiah from Tophet , whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of the Lord 's house ; and said to all the people ,
then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
but I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , saith the Lord : and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof , and it shall devour all things round about it .
and say , Hear the word of the Lord , O king of Judah , that sittest upon the throne of David , thou , and THY servants , and THY people that enter in by these gates :
and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek THY life , and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest , even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of the Chaldeans .
is this man Coniah a despised broken idol ? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure ? wherefore are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
for the land is full of adulterers ; for because of swearing the land mourneth ; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up , and their course is evil , and their force is not right .
the anger of the Lord shall not return , until he have executed , and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly .
and the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hearkened , nor inclined your ear to hear .
moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones , and the light of the candle .
and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations .
to wit , Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and the kings thereof , and the princes thereof , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , an hissing , and a curse ; as it is this day ;
and all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of Uz , and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Azzah , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdoms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and an howling of the principal of the flock , shall be heard : for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture .
if so be they will hearken , and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent me of the evil , which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings .
to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hearkened ;
when the princes of Judah heard these things , then they came up from the king 's house unto the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house .
I have made the earth , the man and the beast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my outstretched arm , and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me .
and now have I given all these lands unto the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
Yea , thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem ;
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried them to Babylon :
then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) saying ,
thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , unto all that are carried away captives , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon ;
and out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
behold , the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury , a continuing whirlwind : it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked .
the fierce anger of the Lord shall not return , until he have done it , and until he have performed the intents of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it .
again I will build thee , and thou shalt be built , O virgin of Israel : thou shalt again be adorned with THY tabrets , and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I smote upon my thigh : I was ashamed , yea , even confounded , because I did bear the reproach of my youth .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of beast .
thus saith the Lord ; If heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , saith the Lord .
for then the king of Babylon 's army besieged Jerusalem : and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Judah 's house .
and hast brought forth THY people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with great terror ;
for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , saith the Lord .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
and I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , whereby they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , whereby they have sinned , and whereby they have transgressed against me .
this is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , after that the king Zedekiah had made a Covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them ;
but afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , nor our daughters ;
and it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah : and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken unto him , upon a roll of a book .
and they went in to the king into the court , but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe , and told all the words in the ears of the king .
then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the roll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
for though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
and it came to pass , that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
so they drew up Jeremiah with cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver thee . obey , I beseech thee , the voice of the Lord , which I speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and THY soul shall live .
and the Chaldeans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and brake down the walls of Jerusalem .
but Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
even they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he dwelt among the people .
but I will deliver thee in that day , saith the Lord : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
for I will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but THY life shall be for a prey unto thee : because thou hast put THY trust in me , saith the Lord .
Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him , even with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans that were found there , and the men of war .
and it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men that were with him .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
and now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you .
but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away captives into Babylon .
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , obeyed not the voice of the Lord , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , that were returned from all nations , whither they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Judah ;
so they came into the land of Egypt : for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord : thus came they even to Tahpanhes .
take great stones in thine hand , and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
and when he cometh , he shall smite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for captivity to captivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
they are not humbled even unto this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
for I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence :
as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord , we will not hearken unto thee .
then Jeremiah said unto all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people which had given him that answer , saying ,
against Egypt , against the army of Pharaoh @-@ necho king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye chariots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiopians and the Libyans , that handle the shield ; and the Lydians , that handle and bend the bow .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is spoiled , and his brethren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread his wings over Bozrah : and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
I have laid a snare for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou wast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast striven against the Lord .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God , the vengeance of his temple .
against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow , and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine : and spare ye not her young men ; destroy ye utterly all her host .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her iniquity ; for this is the time of the Lord 's vengeance ; he will render unto her a recompence .
and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his Rider ; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his Rider ;
with thee also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young ; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid ;
and the land shall tremble and sorrow : for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Babylon , to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant .
therefore , behold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the Graven images of Babylon : and her whole land shall be confounded , and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
for through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , till he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
and in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was sore in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
and the king of Babylon smote them , and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath . thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land .
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his diet , there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks : among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her , they are become her enemies .
the adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things : for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary , whom thou didst command that they should not enter into THY Congregation .
how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger !
the Lord was as an enemy : he hath swallowed up Israel , he hath swallowed up all her palaces : he hath destroyed his strong holds , and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
mine eyes do fail with tears , my bowels are troubled , my liver is poured upon the earth , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city .
their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thyself no rest ; let not the apple of thine eye cease .
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword ; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger ; thou hast killed , and not pitied .
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaketh it unto them .
they that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger : for these pine away , stricken through for want of the fruits of the field .
the kings of the earth , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem .
the anger of the Lord hath divided them ; he will no more regard them : they respected not the persons of the priests , they favoured not the elders .
rejoice and be glad , O daughter of Edom , that dwellest in the land of Uz ; the cup also shall pass through unto thee : thou shalt be drunken , and shalt make thyself naked .
also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures . and this was their appearance ; they had the likeness of a man .
and their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot : and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl : and they four had one likeness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
Whithersoever the spirit was to go , they went , thither was their spirit to go ; and the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
and they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear , ( for they are a rebellious house , ) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them .
not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language , whose words thou canst not understand . surely , had I sent thee to them , they would have hearkened unto thee .
I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another , and the noise of the wheels over against them , and a noise of a great rushing .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
and it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the Lord stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar : and I fell on my face .
but thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
and I will make THY tongue cleave to the roof of THY mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
and lay siege against it , and build a Fort against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set battering rams against it round about .
for I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and ninety days : so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
and , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of THY siege .
and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations , and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judgments and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
and I will do in thee that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all thine abominations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds .
and I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars .
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them mourning , every one for his iniquity .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty : but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein : therefore have I set it far from them .
and I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall pollute it .
Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be defiled .
then I beheld , and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his loins even downward , fire ; and from his loins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of Amber .
then I looked , and , behold , in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
and when I looked , behold the four wheels by the cherubims , one wheel by one cherub , and another wheel by another cherub : and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes round about , even the wheels that they four had .
and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar , their appearances and themselves : they went every one straight forward .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
and I will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
and the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
son of man , thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house , which have eyes to see , and see not ; they have ears to hear , and hear not : for they are a rebellious house .
Ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord .
say unto them which daub it with untempered morter , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and ye , O great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall rend it .
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and they shall comfort you , when ye see their ways and their doings : and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , saith the Lord God .
behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire devoureth both the ends of it , and the midst of it is burned . is it meet for any work ?
and as for THY nativity , in the day thou wast born THY navel was not cut , neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee ; thou wast not salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
none eye pitied thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of THY person , in the day that thou wast born .
Thou hast also taken THY fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and madest to thyself images of men , and didst commit whoredom with them ,
moreover thou hast taken THY sons and THY daughters , whom thou hast borne unto me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured . is this of THY whoredoms a small matter ,
Thou hast built THY high place at every head of the way , and hast made THY beauty to be abhorred , and hast opened THY feet to every one that passed by , and multiplied THY whoredoms .
so will I make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
Thou art THY mother 's daughter , that lotheth her husband and her children ; and thou art the sister of THY sisters , which lothed their husbands and their children : your mother was an Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
when THY sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate , and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate , then thou and THY daughters shall return to your former estate .
that thou mayest remember , and be confounded , and never open THY mouth any more because of THY shame , when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done , saith the Lord God .
he cropped off the top of his young twigs , and carried it into a land of traffick ; he set it in a city of merchants .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me .
neither hath oppressed any , hath not withholden the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
as for his father , because he cruelly oppressed , spoiled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , lo , even he shall die in his iniquity .
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
all his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live .
and they put him in ward in chains , and brought him to the king of Babylon : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
but I said unto their children in the wilderness , Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their judgments , nor defile yourselves with their idols :
nevertheless I withdrew mine hand , and wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen , in whose sight I brought them forth .
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the heathen , and disperse them through the countries ;
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
as I live , saith the Lord God , surely with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out , will I rule over you :
and I will cause you to pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant :
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your doings , wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
then said I , Ah Lord God ! they say of me , Doth he not speak parables ?
and he hath give it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the Slayer .
and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight , to them that have sworn oaths : but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be taken .
shall I cause it to return into his sheath ? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of THY nativity .
in thee have they set light by father and mother : in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger : in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
and they committed whoredoms in Egypt ; they committed whoredoms in their youth : there were their breasts pressed , and there they bruised the teats of their virginity .
thus she committed her whoredoms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria , and with all on whom she doted : with all their idols she defiled herself .
neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her .
yet she multiplied her whoredoms , in calling to remembrance the days of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
for thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest , into the hand of them from whom THY mind is alienated :
Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt break the sherds thereof , and pluck off thine own breasts : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot : so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah , the lewd women .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall slay their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth @-@ jeshimoth , Baal @-@ meon , and Kiriathaim ,
and it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all THY streets : he shall slay THY people by the sword , and THY strong garrisons shall go down to the ground .
of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars ; the company of the Ashurites have made THY benches of Ivory , brought out of the isles of Chittim .
the men of Arvad with thine army were upon THY walls round about , and the Gammadims were in THY towers : they hanged their shields upon THY walls round about ; they have made THY beauty perfect .
the ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in THY market : and thou wast replenished , and made very glorious in the midst of the seas .
and all that handle the oar , the mariners , and all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships , they shall stand upon the land ;
and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust upon their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
when THY wares went forth out of the seas , thou filledst many people ; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of THY riches and of THY merchandise .
behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of THY wisdom , and they shall defile THY brightness .
Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and I have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
and I will bring again the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their habitation ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the basest of the kingdoms ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
in that day will I cause the Horn of the house of Israel to bud forth , and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
and the sword shall come upon Egypt , and great pain shall be in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
and it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field , and his boughs were multiplied , and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters , when he shot forth .
all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow dwelt all great nations .
I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches : so that all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , envied him .
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen ; he shall surely deal with him : I have driven him out for his wickedness .
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen .
and it came to pass in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
by the swords of the mighty will I cause THY multitude to fall , the terrible of the nations , all of them : and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt , and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full , when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the Lord .
it came to pass also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , unto the nether parts of the earth , with them that go down into the pit .
whose graves are set in the sides of the pit , and her company is round about her grave : all of them slain , fallen by the sword , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Meshech , Tubal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is Edom , her kings , and all her princes , which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with them that go down to the pit .
nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered THY soul .
and they were scattered , because there is no shepherd : and they became meat to all the beasts of the field , when they were scattered .
I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
and I will make with them a Covenant of peace , and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land : and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
and I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen , neither shall the beast of the land devour them ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make them afraid .
and I will raise up for them a plant of renown , and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land , neither bear the shame of the heathen any more .
and I will fill his mountains with his slain men : in THY hills , and in THY valleys , and in all THY rivers , shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
and thou shalt know that I am the Lord , and that I have heard all THY blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they are given us to consume .
then will I sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
a new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you an heart of flesh .
and I will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and ye shall keep my judgments , and do them .
then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
the hand of the Lord was upon me , and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord , and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones ,
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
and thou shalt come from THY place out of the north parts , thou , and many people with thee , all of them riding upon horses , a great company , and a mighty army :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , saith the Lord God , that my fury shall come up in my face .
then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , which cause them to be led into captivity among the heathen : but I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
and the arches thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and at the side without , as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
afterward he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tabernacle .
and the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about , and the length thereof ninety cubits .
so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
and the doors had two leaves apiece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick planks .
then he brought me forth into the utter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place , and which was before the building toward the north .
over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court , and over against the pavement which was for the utter court , was gallery against gallery in three stories .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth shined with his glory .
now let them put away their whoredom , and the carcases of their kings , far from me , and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
and thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok , which approach unto me , to minister unto me , saith the Lord God , a young bullock for a sin offering .
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
and thou shalt offer them before the Lord , and the priests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the Lord .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord : and I fell upon my face .
concerning the ordinance of oil , the bath of oil , ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the Cor , which is an Homer of ten baths ; for ten baths are an Homer :
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord , seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days ; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram : they shall be without blemish .
and when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way thereof .
then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward , and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward ; and , behold , there ran out waters on the right side .
now when I had returned , behold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
and the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty , and toward the south two hundred and fifty , and toward the east two hundred and fifty , and toward the west two hundred and fifty .
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he drank : so nourishing them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names : for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , of Shadrach ; and to Mishael , of Meshach ; and to Azariah , of Abed @-@ nego .
then let our countenances be looked upon before thee , and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as thou seest , deal with THY servants .
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the astrologers , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , for to shew the king his dreams . so they came and stood before the king .
and it is a rare thing that the king requireth , and there is none other that can shew it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
Daniel answered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men , the astrologers , the magicians , the soothsayers , shew unto the king ;
but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets , and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . THY dream , and the visions of THY head upon THY bed , are these ;
and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things : and as iron that breaketh all these , shall it break in pieces and bruise .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
the king spake , and said , Is not this great Babylon , that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from heaven , saying , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to thee it is spoken ; The kingdom is departed from thee .
in the same hour came forth fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with scarlet , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made a proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
then the king , when he heard these words , was sore displeased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting : neither were instruments of musick brought before him : and his sleep went from him .
I saw in the night visions , and , behold , one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven , and came to the Ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
and as I was considering , behold , an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth , and touched not the ground : and the goat had a notable Horn between his eyes .
and he came to the ram that had two horns , which I had there seen standing before the river , and ran unto him in the fury of his power .
Yea , he magnified himself even to the prince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
and it came to pass , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , and sought for the meaning , then , behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
neither have we hearkened unto THY servants the prophets , which spake in THY name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil , and brought it upon us : for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth : for we obeyed not his voice .
Yea , whiles I was speaking in prayer , even the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening oblation .
therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , straightway there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
and the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
and in his estate shall stand up a vile person , to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom : but he shall come in peaceably , and obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt : and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the abomination that maketh desolate set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days .
but I will have mercy upon the house of Judah , and will save them by the Lord their God , and will not save them by bow , nor by sword , nor by battle , by horses , nor by horsemen .
then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of Jezreel .
Lest I strip her naked , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and slay her with thirst .
therefore will I return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness .
and I will visit upon her the days of Baalim , wherein she burned incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgat me , saith the Lord .
for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a prince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ephod , and without teraphim :
hear the word of the Lord , ye children of Israel : for the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore shall the land mourn , and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish , with the beasts of the field , and with the fowls of heaven ; yea , the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away .
for they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit whoredom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the Lord .
my people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff declareth unto them : for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err , and they have gone a whoring from under their God .
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom , nor your spouses when they commit adultery : for themselves are separated with whores , and they sacrifice with harlots : therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall .
they will not frame their doings to turn unto their God : for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them , and they have not known the Lord .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
I drew them with cords of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws , and I laid meat unto them .
they shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a dove out of the land of Assyria : and I will place them in their houses , saith the Lord .
therefore they shall be as the morning cloud , and as the early dew that passeth away , as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the chimney .
the sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him : he is an unwise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? prudent , and he shall know them ? for the ways of the Lord are right , and the just shall walk in them : but the transgressors shall fall therein .
O Lord , to thee will I cry : for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field .
they shall run to and fro in the city ; they shall run upon the wall , they shall climb up upon the houses ; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief .
and rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the Lord your God : for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth him of the evil .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the Lord your God , that hath dealt wondrously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah , and they shall sell them to the Sabeans , to a people far off : for the Lord hath spoken it .
but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it shall devour the palaces thereof , with shouting in the day of battle , with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind :
that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the meek : and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid , to profane my holy name :
neither shall he stand that handleth the bow ; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself .
hear this word that the Lord hath spoken against you , O children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt , saying ,
can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth , where no gin is for him ? shall one take up a snare from the earth , and have taken nothing at all ?
that in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel : and the horns of the altar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her ; and ye shall cast them into the palace , saith the Lord .
thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me ; and , behold , he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and , lo , it was the latter growth after the king 's mowings .
for , lo , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is sifted in a sieve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
in that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen , and close up the breaches thereof ; and I will raise up his ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old :
for thou hadst cast me into the deep , in the midst of the seas ; and the floods compassed me about : all THY billows and THY waves passed over me .
for word came unto the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and he laid his robe from him , and covered him with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
so Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city .
and the Lord God prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
and they covet fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
the breaker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord on the head of them .
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then shall they cry unto the Lord , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings .
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord , in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth .
and this man shall be the peace , when the Assyrian shall come into our land : and when he shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shepherds , and eight principal men .
Thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olives , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .

I will bear the indignation of the Lord , because I have sinned against him , until he plead my cause , and execute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall behold his righteousness .
he will turn again , he will have compassion upon us ; he will subdue our iniquities ; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .

agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
and if THY right hand offend thee , cut if off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of THY members should perish , and not that THY whole body should be cast into hell .
but I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ;
but thou , when thou prayest , enter into THY closet , and when thou hast shut THY door , pray to THY Father which is in secret ; and THY Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :

for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .

but when the fourteenth night was come , as we were driven up and down in Adria , about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country ;
and when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
and when they had taken up the anchors , they committed themselves unto the sea , and loosed the rudder bands , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind , and made toward shore .
and falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .
and it came to pass , that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
and when we came to Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ;
for when the Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves :
now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the deadness of Sara 's womb :
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth ; but if the husband be dead , she is loosed from the law of her husband .
but ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
but if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
for if ye live after the flesh , ye shall die : but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body , ye shall live .
moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
who is he that condemneth ? it is Christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
and if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . but if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
for whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
and I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Jesus Christ 's sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ;
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
for it hath been declared unto me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
and base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are :
now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
every man 's work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
for who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
and such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sinneth not : let them marry .
nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
but meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
what is my reward then ? Verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
but I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway .
the cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
but if any man say unto you , This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof :
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
when I was a child , I spake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
what is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
as touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints which are in all Achaia :
who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
and whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
and I wrote this same unto you , lest , when I came , I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
( for he saith , I have heard thee in a time accepted , and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee : behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation . )
for if I have boasted any thing to him of you , I am not ashamed ; but as we spake all things to you in truth , even so our boasting , which I made before Titus , is found a truth .
now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are absent , such will we be also in deed when we are present .
not boasting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's labours ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly ,
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a Thorn in the flesh , the messenger of Satan to buffet me , lest I should be exalted above measure .
in whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise ,
and , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconcile all things unto himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in earth , or things in heaven .
for our gospel came not unto you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy ghost , and in much assurance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to God @-@ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
nor of men sought we glory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been burdensome , as the Apostles of Christ .
now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher , and an Apostle , ( I speak the truth in Christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity .
( for if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ , nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine , whereunto thou hast attained .
for this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . for in that he put all in subjection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
and they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ;
through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
by faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
and truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
by faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
( for they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart :
be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines . for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with meats , which have not profited them that have been occupied therein .
be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
but let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not corruptible , even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
for when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error .
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
but the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the Father .
if a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks . the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God .
and unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write ; These things saith the Son of God , who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire , and his feet are like fine brass ;
he that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
and when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
and the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before God out of the angel 's hand .
and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
and they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
for their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto Serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again , and said , Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
and I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
but the court which is without the temple leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given unto the Gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
and I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name .
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
for they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication , and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
and the kings of the earth , who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her , shall bewail her , and lament for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
for true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand .
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
and he measured the wall thereof , an hundred and forty and four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the angel .
and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it : and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it .
and I John saw these things , and heard them . and when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things .
