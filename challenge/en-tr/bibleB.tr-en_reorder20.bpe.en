and God created great wh@@ al@@ es , and every living cre@@ ature that mov@@ eth , which the waters brought forth ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , after their kind , and every w@@ ing@@ ed fo@@ w@@ l after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let us make man in our image , after our lik@@ eness : and let them have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , and over the fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and over the c@@ attle , and over all the ear@@ th , and over every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th .
and God b@@ les@@ sed them , and God said un@@ to them , Be fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply , and rep@@ len@@ ish the ear@@ th , and sub@@ due it : and have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , and over the fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and over every living thing that mov@@ eth upon the ear@@ th .
and God said , be@@ hold , I have given you every her@@ b bearing se@@ ed , which is upon the face of all the ear@@ th , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed ; to you it shall be for meat .
and to every be@@ ast of the ear@@ th , and to every fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and to every thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th , where@@ in there is life , I have given every green her@@ b for meat : and it was so .
and every plant of the field before it was in the ear@@ th , and every her@@ b of the field before it grew : for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the ear@@ th , and there was not a man to ti@@ ll the ground .
and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleas@@ ant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the mid@@ st of the gar@@ den , and the tree of knowledge of good and ev@@ il .
and they heard the voice of the Lord God walk@@ ing in the gar@@ den in the co@@ ol of the day : and A@@ dam and his wife hi@@ d themselves from the presence of the Lord God am@@ on@@ g@@ st the trees of the gar@@ den .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast driven me out this day from the face of the ear@@ th ; and from TH@@ Y face shall I be hi@@ d ; and I shall be a fugitive and a v@@ ag@@ ab@@ ond in the ear@@ th ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that fin@@ de@@ th me shall s@@ lay me .
and this is the fashion which th@@ ou s@@ halt make it of : the length of the Ar@@ k shall be three hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , the b@@ read@@ th of it fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of it thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
a window s@@ halt th@@ ou make to the Ar@@ k , and in a cu@@ bit s@@ halt th@@ ou finish it above ; and the door of the Ar@@ k s@@ halt th@@ ou set in the side there@@ of ; with lower , second , and third stories s@@ halt th@@ ou make it .
and , be@@ hold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the ear@@ th , to destroy all f@@ les@@ h , where@@ in is the bre@@ ath of life , from under heav@@ en ; and every thing that is in the ear@@ th shall die .
of fo@@ w@@ ls after their kind , and of c@@ attle after their kind , of every cre@@ eping thing of the ear@@ th after his kind , two of every sort shall come un@@ to the@@ e , to keep them alive .
in the six hund@@ red@@ th year of No@@ ah 's life , in the second month , the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th day of the month , the same day were all the fo@@ un@@ tains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heav@@ en were opened .
they , and every be@@ ast after his kind , and all the c@@ attle after their kind , and every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th after his kind , and every fo@@ w@@ l after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and it came to pass in the six hund@@ red@@ th and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dri@@ ed up from off the ear@@ th : and No@@ ah removed the covering of the Ar@@ k , and looked , and , be@@ hold , the face of the ground was d@@ ry .
bring forth with the@@ e every living thing that is with the@@ e , of all f@@ les@@ h , both of fo@@ w@@ l , and of c@@ attle , and of every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th ; that they may bre@@ ed ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly in the ear@@ th , and be fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply upon the ear@@ th .
and the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you shall be upon every be@@ ast of the ear@@ th , and upon every fo@@ w@@ l of the air , upon all that mov@@ eth upon the ear@@ th , and upon all the fis@@ hes of the sea ; into your hand are they delivered .
and su@@ rely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every be@@ ast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man .
and Ab@@ ram and N@@ ah@@ or took them wi@@ ves : the name of Ab@@ ram 's wife was Sar@@ ai ; and the name of N@@ ah@@ or 's wife , Mil@@ ca@@ h , the daughter of Har@@ an , the father of Mil@@ ca@@ h , and the father of Is@@ ca@@ h .
and Ter@@ ah took Ab@@ ram his son , and lot the son of Har@@ an his son 's son , and Sar@@ ai his daughter in law , his son Ab@@ ram 's wife ; and they went forth with them from U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and they came un@@ to Har@@ an , and d@@ wel@@ t there .
and Ab@@ ram took Sar@@ ai his wife , and lot his brother 's son , and all their sub@@ stance that they had gathered , and the so@@ ul@@ s that they had gotten in Har@@ an ; and they went forth to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and into the land of Can@@ a@@ an they came .
and he removed from th@@ ence un@@ to a mountain on the east of Be@@ the@@ l , and pit@@ ched his tent , having Be@@ the@@ l on the west , and H@@ ai on the east : and there he buil@@ ded an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord , and called upon the name of the Lord .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said un@@ to Sar@@ ai his wife , be@@ hold now , I know that th@@ ou art a fair woman to look upon :
is not the whole land before the@@ e ? separate th@@ y@@ self , I pra@@ y the@@ e , from me : if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t take the left hand , then I will go to the right ; or if th@@ ou de@@ part to the right hand , then I will go to the left .
and , be@@ hold , the word of the Lord came un@@ to him , saying , This shall not be th@@ ine he@@ ir ; but he that shall come forth out of th@@ ine own bo@@ wel@@ s shall be th@@ ine he@@ ir .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham took I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's house ; and circum@@ c@@ ised the f@@ les@@ h of their fo@@ res@@ kin in the sel@@ f@@ same day , as God had said un@@ to him .
and he lift up his eyes and looked , and , lo , three men stood by him : and when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bo@@ wed himself toward the ground ,
and while he lin@@ gered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; the Lord being mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
be@@ hold now , TH@@ Y ser@@ vant hat@@ h found grace in TH@@ Y sight , and th@@ ou h@@ ast mag@@ ni@@ fied TH@@ Y mer@@ cy , which th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed un@@ to me in saving my life ; and I can@@ not escape to the mountain , lest some ev@@ il take me , and I die :
and he looked toward So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and toward all the land of the pla@@ in , and be@@ held , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a fur@@ n@@ ace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the pla@@ in , that God remember@@ ed Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and sent lot out of the mid@@ st of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in the which lot d@@ wel@@ t .
and it came to pass , when God caused me to w@@ ander from my father 's house , that I said un@@ to her , This is TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ ness which th@@ ou s@@ halt she@@ w un@@ to me ; at every place w@@ hi@@ ther we shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bo@@ w@@ shot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and we@@ pt .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham built an alt@@ ar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and laid him on the alt@@ ar upon the wood .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold behind him a ram caught in a th@@ ic@@ ket by his hor@@ ns : and Ab@@ ra@@ ham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering in the stead of his son .
that in b@@ les@@ sing I will b@@ less the@@ e , and in multi@@ plying I will multi@@ ply TH@@ Y se@@ ed as the stars of the heav@@ en , and as the s@@ and which is upon the sea shore ; and TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall poss@@ ess the gate of his enem@@ ies ;
that he may give me the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which he hat@@ h , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place am@@ on@@ g@@ st you .
and E@@ ph@@ ron d@@ wel@@ t among the children of H@@ eth : and E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te answ@@ ered Ab@@ ra@@ ham in the audience of the children of H@@ eth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
and I will make the@@ e swe@@ ar by the Lord , the God of heav@@ en , and the God of the ear@@ th , that th@@ ou s@@ halt not take a wife un@@ to my son of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , among whom I d@@ well :
and the ser@@ vant took ten ca@@ me@@ ls of the ca@@ me@@ ls of his master , and depar@@ ted ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he ar@@ ose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , un@@ to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah came out , who was born to B@@ eth@@ uel , son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's brother , with her pit@@ cher upon her sho@@ ul@@ der .
be@@ hold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the vir@@ gin co@@ me@@ th forth to draw water , and I say to her , Gi@@ ve me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , a little water of TH@@ Y pit@@ cher to drink ;
and I bo@@ wed down my head , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord , and b@@ les@@ sed the Lord God of my master Ab@@ ra@@ ham , which had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter un@@ to his son .
and I@@ sa@@ ac dig@@ ged again the wel@@ ls of water , which they had dig@@ ged in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father ; for the phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped them after the death of Ab@@ ra@@ ham : and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
and it came to pass , as soon as I@@ sa@@ ac had made an end of b@@ les@@ sing Jac@@ o@@ b , and Jac@@ o@@ b was yet scar@@ ce gone out from the presence of I@@ sa@@ ac his father , that E@@ sa@@ u his brother came in from his hun@@ ting .
and he ligh@@ ted upon a certain place , and tar@@ ried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pil@@ lows , and lay down in that place to sle@@ ep .
and TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall be as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and th@@ ou s@@ halt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in the@@ e and in TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall all the families of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed .
and , be@@ hold , I am with the@@ e , and will keep the@@ e in all places w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est , and will bring the@@ e again into this land ; for I will not leave the@@ e , until I have done that which I have spoken to the@@ e of .
and Jac@@ o@@ b rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pil@@ lows , and set it up for a pil@@ lar , and p@@ oured oil upon the top of it .
and he looked , and be@@ hold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three f@@ loc@@ ks of she@@ ep lying by it ; for out of that well they wat@@ ered the f@@ loc@@ ks : and a great stone was upon the well 's m@@ outh .
and it came to pass , when Jac@@ o@@ b saw R@@ ach@@ el the daughter of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother , and the she@@ ep of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother , that Jac@@ o@@ b went near , and rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the flock of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother .
and it came to pass , when Lab@@ an heard the ti@@ dings of Jac@@ o@@ b his sister 's son , that he ran to meet him , and embrac@@ ed him , and k@@ is@@ sed him , and brought him to his house . and he told Lab@@ an all these things .
I will pass through all TH@@ Y flock to day , removing from th@@ ence all the spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted c@@ attle , and all the bro@@ wn c@@ attle among the she@@ ep , and the spot@@ ted and spec@@ k@@ led among the go@@ ats : and of such shall be my h@@ ire .
and he removed that day the he go@@ ats that were r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked and spot@@ ted , and all the she go@@ ats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the bro@@ wn among the she@@ ep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and Jac@@ o@@ b did separate the lam@@ bs , and set the faces of the f@@ loc@@ ks toward the r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked , and all the bro@@ wn in the flock of Lab@@ an ; and he put his own f@@ loc@@ ks by themselves , and put them not un@@ to Lab@@ an 's c@@ attle .
and it came to pass at the time that the c@@ attle conce@@ ived , that I lifted up mine eyes , and saw in a dream , and , be@@ hold , the r@@ ams which le@@ ap@@ ed upon the c@@ attle were r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gr@@ is@@ led .
and Lab@@ an went into Jac@@ o@@ b 's tent , and into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the two ma@@ id@@ servants ' ten@@ ts ; but he found them not . then went he out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into R@@ ach@@ el 's tent .
I am not wor@@ thy of the least of all the mer@@ cies , and of all the truth , which th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
deliver me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of E@@ sa@@ u : for I fear him , lest he will come and sm@@ ite me , and the mother with the children .
and Jac@@ o@@ b lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , E@@ sa@@ u came , and with him four hundred men . and he divided the children un@@ to Le@@ ah , and un@@ to R@@ ach@@ el , and un@@ to the two hand@@ ma@@ ids .
let my lor@@ d , I pra@@ y the@@ e , pass over before his ser@@ vant : and I will lead on sof@@ tly , according as the c@@ attle that go@@ eth before me and the children be able to en@@ dur@@ e , until I come un@@ to my lor@@ d un@@ to Se@@ ir .
and he bought a par@@ cel of a field , where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Ham@@ or , Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's father , for an hundred pieces of money .
and E@@ sa@@ u took his wi@@ ves , and his sons , and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and all the persons of his house , and his c@@ attle , and all his be@@ asts , and all his sub@@ stance , which he had got in the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jac@@ o@@ b .
for , be@@ hold , we were binding s@@ heav@@ es in the field , and , lo , my she@@ af ar@@ ose , and also stood u@@ pri@@ ght ; and , be@@ hold , your s@@ heav@@ es stood round about , and made obe@@ is@@ ance to my she@@ af .
and Re@@ ub@@ en said un@@ to them , shed no blood , but cast him into this p@@ it that is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and lay no hand upon him ; that he might rid him out of their hands , to deliver him to his father again .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , that they stri@@ pt Joseph out of his co@@ at , his co@@ at of many c@@ olo@@ urs that was on him ;
and they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , be@@ hold , a company of I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes came from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad with their ca@@ me@@ ls bearing sp@@ ic@@ ery and bal@@ m and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , going to carry it down to Egypt .
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and they dre@@ amed a dream both of them , each man his dream in one night , each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream , the Butler and the Bak@@ er of the king of Egypt , which were bound in the prison .
and it came to pass the third day , which was P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's birthday , that he made a feast un@@ to all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief Butler and of the chief Bak@@ er among his servants .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the mag@@ ic@@ ians of Egypt , and all the wise men there@@ of : and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpre@@ t them un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and there was there with us a young man , an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , ser@@ vant to the captain of the guard ; and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dre@@ ams ; to each man according to his dream he did interpre@@ t .
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years , which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was round about every city , laid he up in the same .
and Joseph was the governor over the land , and he it was that sold to all the people of the land : and Joseph 's bre@@ th@@ ren came , and bo@@ wed down themselves before him with their faces to the ear@@ th .
and it came to pass as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that , be@@ hold , every man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack : and when both they and their father saw the bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
and it came to pass , when we came to the In@@ n , that we opened our s@@ acks , and , be@@ hold , every man 's money was in the m@@ outh of his s@@ ack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans might not eat bread with the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ; for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
be@@ hold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' m@@ ou@@ ths , we brought again un@@ to the@@ e out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an : how then should we ste@@ al out of TH@@ Y lor@@ d 's house silver or gold ?
then Ju@@ da@@ h came near un@@ to him , and said , O@@ h my lor@@ d , let TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , I pra@@ y the@@ e , speak a word in my lor@@ d 's e@@ ars , and let not th@@ ine an@@ ger bur@@ n against TH@@ Y ser@@ vant : for th@@ ou art even as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be near un@@ to me , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y children , and TH@@ Y children 's children , and TH@@ Y f@@ loc@@ ks , and TH@@ Y her@@ ds , and all that th@@ ou h@@ ast :
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two so@@ ul@@ s : all the so@@ ul@@ s of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , which came into Egypt , were thre@@ es@@ core and ten .
and Joseph made ready his char@@ i@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Gos@@ h@@ en , and presented himself un@@ to him ; and he fell on his nec@@ k , and we@@ pt on his nec@@ k a good while .
and Joseph said un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , and un@@ to his father 's house , I will go up , and she@@ w P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and say un@@ to him , My bre@@ th@@ ren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , are come un@@ to me ;
they said moreover un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , For to so@@ jour@@ n in the land are we come ; for TH@@ Y servants have no pas@@ ture for their f@@ loc@@ ks ; for the fam@@ ine is sor@@ e in the land of Can@@ a@@ an : now therefore , we pra@@ y the@@ e , let TH@@ Y servants d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the cor@@ n which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
and they brought their c@@ attle un@@ to Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for hor@@ ses , and for the f@@ loc@@ ks , and for the c@@ attle of the her@@ ds , and for the ass@@ es : and he f@@ ed them with bread for all their c@@ attle for that year .
and it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and four parts shall be your own , for se@@ ed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your little ones .
and as for me , when I came from P@@ adan , R@@ ach@@ el died by me in the land of Can@@ a@@ an in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come un@@ to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath : and I buried her there in the way of E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath ; the same is B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem .
O my sou@@ l , come not th@@ ou into their secret ; un@@ to their assembly , mine honour , be not th@@ ou united : for in their an@@ ger they sle@@ w a man , and in their sel@@ f@@ will they dig@@ ged down a wall .
the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of TH@@ Y father have prev@@ ailed above the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of my pro@@ gen@@ itors un@@ to the ut@@ most bound of the ever@@ lasting hil@@ ls : they shall be on the head of Joseph , and on the cro@@ wn of the head of him that was separate from his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph sp@@ ake un@@ to the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying , If now I have found grace in your eyes , speak , I pra@@ y you , in the e@@ ars of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying ,
and he said , When ye do the office of a mid@@ wife to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w women , and see them upon the sto@@ ols ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an Ar@@ k of bul@@ rus@@ hes , and da@@ ub@@ ed it with sli@@ me and with pit@@ ch , and put the child there@@ in ; and she laid it in the flags by the river 's br@@ ink .
and it came to pass in those days , when Mos@@ es was grown , that he went out un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , and looked on their bur@@ den@@ s : and he sp@@ ied an Egyptian s@@ mit@@ ing an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , one of his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the king of Egypt died : and the children of Israel si@@ gh@@ ed by reason of the bon@@ da@@ ge , and they cri@@ ed , and their cry came up un@@ to God by reason of the bon@@ da@@ ge .
now Mos@@ es kept the flock of J@@ eth@@ ro his father in law , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian : and he led the flock to the back@@ side of the de@@ sert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Ho@@ re@@ b .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord appeared un@@ to him in a fla@@ me of fire out of the mid@@ st of a b@@ ush : and he looked , and , be@@ hold , the b@@ ush burned with fire , and the b@@ ush was not consu@@ med .
and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and to bring them up out of that land un@@ to a good land and a large , un@@ to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey ; un@@ to the place of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites .
and God said moreover un@@ to Mos@@ es , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to the children of Israel , The Lord God of your fa@@ thers , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you : this is my name for ever , and this is my memorial un@@ to all generations .
go , and gather the el@@ ders of Israel together , and say un@@ to them , The Lord God of your fa@@ thers , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , of I@@ sa@@ ac , and of Jac@@ o@@ b , appeared un@@ to me , saying , I have su@@ rely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the aff@@ li@@ ction of Egypt un@@ to the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , un@@ to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey .
but every woman shall bor@@ row of her neighbour , and of her that so@@ journ@@ eth in her house , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and ye shall sp@@ oil the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither he@@ arken un@@ to TH@@ Y voice , that th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the water of the river , and p@@ our it upon the d@@ ry land : and the water which th@@ ou tak@@ est out of the river shall become blood upon the d@@ ry land .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which br@@ ing@@ eth you out from under the bur@@ den@@ s of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and un@@ to Aaron , and gave them a charge un@@ to the children of Israel , and un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and Am@@ ram took him Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed his father 's sister to wife ; and she b@@ are him Aaron and Mos@@ es : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
get the@@ e un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h in the morning ; lo , he go@@ eth out un@@ to the water ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt stand by the river 's br@@ ink against he come ; and the ro@@ d which was turned to a ser@@ p@@ ent s@@ halt th@@ ou take in th@@ ine hand .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , In this th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord : be@@ hold , I will sm@@ ite with the ro@@ d that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron did so , as the Lord comman@@ ded ; and he lifted up the ro@@ d , and smo@@ te the waters that were in the river , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
and the river shall bring forth fro@@ gs ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , which shall go up and come into th@@ ine house , and into TH@@ Y bed@@ chamber , and upon TH@@ Y bed , and into the house of TH@@ Y servants , and upon TH@@ Y people , and into th@@ ine ov@@ ens , and into TH@@ Y k@@ ne@@ ad@@ ing@@ t@@ rough@@ s :
and they did so ; for Aaron stret@@ ched out his hand with his ro@@ d , and smo@@ te the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and it became lice in man , and in be@@ ast ; all the d@@ ust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
else , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not let my people go , be@@ hold , I will send s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies upon the@@ e , and upon TH@@ Y servants , and upon TH@@ Y people , and into TH@@ Y houses : and the houses of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall be full of s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies , and also the ground where@@ on they are .
and the Lord did so ; and there came a gri@@ ev@@ ous s@@ warm of f@@ lies into the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and into his servants ' houses , and into all the land of Egypt : the land was cor@@ rupted by reason of the s@@ warm of f@@ lies .
be@@ hold , the hand of the Lord is upon TH@@ Y c@@ attle which is in the field , upon the hor@@ ses , upon the ass@@ es , upon the ca@@ me@@ ls , upon the ox@@ en , and upon the she@@ ep : there shall be a very gri@@ ev@@ ous mur@@ rain .
and the ha@@ il smo@@ te throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and be@@ ast ; and the ha@@ il smo@@ te every her@@ b of the field , and br@@ ake every tree of the field .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to him , As soon as I am gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands un@@ to the Lord ; and the Th@@ under shall ce@@ ase , neither shall there be any more ha@@ il ; that th@@ ou may@@ est know how that the ear@@ th is the Lord 's .
and that th@@ ou may@@ est tell in the e@@ ars of TH@@ Y son , and of TH@@ Y son 's son , what things I have w@@ rought in Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that ye may know how that I am the Lord .
and they shall cover the face of the ear@@ th , that one can@@ not be able to see the ear@@ th : and they shall eat the resi@@ due of that which is escaped , which remain@@ eth un@@ to you from the ha@@ il , and shall eat every tree which grow@@ eth for you out of the field :
and they shall fill TH@@ Y houses , and the houses of all TH@@ Y servants , and the houses of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; which neither TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , nor TH@@ Y fa@@ thers ' fa@@ thers have seen , since the day that they were upon the ear@@ th un@@ to this day . and he turned himself , and went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . moreover the man Mos@@ es was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h that sit@@ te@@ th upon his th@@ r@@ one , even un@@ to the fir@@ st@@ born of the ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant that is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of be@@ asts .
speak ye un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lam@@ b , according to the house of their fa@@ thers , a lam@@ b for an house :
for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will sm@@ ite all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , both man and be@@ ast ; and against all the go@@ ds of Egypt I will exec@@ ute judgment : I am the Lord .
and in the first day there shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation , and in the seventh day there shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
seven days shall there be no le@@ av@@ en found in your houses : for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever e@@ ate@@ th that which is le@@ av@@ ened , even that sou@@ l shall be cut off from the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , whether he be a st@@ ran@@ ger , or born in the land .
and ye shall take a bun@@ ch of hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and dip it in the blood that is in the bas@@ on , and strike the lin@@ tel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bas@@ on ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
for the Lord will pass through to sm@@ ite the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and when he se@@ eth the blood upon the lin@@ tel , and on the two side posts , the Lord will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destro@@ yer to come in un@@ to your houses to sm@@ ite you .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as he hat@@ h promised , that ye shall keep this service .
that ye shall say , It is the sacrifice of the Lord 's pass@@ over , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he smo@@ te the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and delivered our houses . and the people bo@@ wed the head and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
and it came to pass , that at midnight the Lord smo@@ te all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ o@@ ah that sat on his th@@ r@@ one un@@ to the fir@@ st@@ born of the cap@@ tive that was in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of c@@ attle .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not le@@ av@@ ened ; because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and could not tar@@ ry , neither had they prepared for themselves any vic@@ tual .
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the sel@@ f@@ same day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring the@@ e into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , which he sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers to give the@@ e , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , that th@@ ou s@@ halt keep this service in this month .
but God led the people about , through the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up har@@ n@@ essed out of the land of Egypt .
and when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h drew n@@ igh , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and , be@@ hold , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans mar@@ ched after them ; and they were sor@@ e afraid : and the children of Israel cri@@ ed out un@@ to the Lord .
and I , be@@ hold , I will har@@ den the hear@@ ts of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon all his host , upon his char@@ i@@ ots , and upon his hor@@ se@@ men .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the Lord looked un@@ to the host of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans through the pil@@ lar of fire and of the cl@@ oud , and troubled the host of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ,
for the hor@@ se of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h went in with his char@@ i@@ ots and with his hor@@ se@@ men into the sea , and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; but the children of Israel went on d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea .
and they took their journey from E@@ lim , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel came un@@ to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , which is between E@@ lim and S@@ ina@@ i , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the second month after their depar@@ ting out of the land of Egypt .
and it came to pass , as Aaron sp@@ ake un@@ to the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared in the cl@@ oud .
and when the dew that lay was gone up , be@@ hold , upon the face of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness there lay a small round thing , as small as the ho@@ ar F@@ ro@@ st on the ground .
and the children of Israel did eat man@@ na for@@ ty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat man@@ na , until they came un@@ to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and Mos@@ es told his father in law all that the Lord had done un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , and all the trav@@ ail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
and let them judge the people at all se@@ as@@ ons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring un@@ to the@@ e , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for th@@ y@@ self , and they shall bear the burden with the@@ e .
an alt@@ ar of ear@@ th th@@ ou s@@ halt make un@@ to me , and s@@ halt sacrifice there@@ on TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and TH@@ Y peace offer@@ ings , TH@@ Y she@@ ep , and th@@ ine ox@@ en : in all places where I record my name I will come un@@ to the@@ e , and I will b@@ less the@@ e .
if she ple@@ ase not her master , who hat@@ h bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed her to himself , then shall he let her be re@@ deemed : to sell her un@@ to a st@@ range nation he shall have no power , seeing he hat@@ h dealt dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully with her .
for that is his covering only , it is his ra@@ im@@ ent for his s@@ kin : where@@ in shall he sle@@ ep ? and it shall come to pass , when he cri@@ eth un@@ to me , that I will hear ; for I am gr@@ ac@@ ious .
and I will set TH@@ Y bo@@ unds from the Red sea even un@@ to the sea of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from the de@@ sert un@@ to the river : for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt drive them out before the@@ e .
and they shall make an Ar@@ k of sh@@ it@@ tim wood : two cu@@ bi@@ ts and a half shall be the length there@@ of , and a cu@@ bit and a half the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of , and a cu@@ bit and a half the he@@ ight there@@ of .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt cast four r@@ ings of gold for it , and put them in the four cor@@ ners there@@ of ; and two r@@ ings shall be in the one side of it , and two r@@ ings in the other side of it .
and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms shall stretch forth their w@@ ings on high , covering the mer@@ cy seat with their w@@ ings , and their faces shall look one to another ; toward the mer@@ cy seat shall the faces of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms be .
three bo@@ w@@ ls made like un@@ to al@@ mon@@ ds , with a K@@ no@@ p and a f@@ lower in one branch ; and three bo@@ w@@ ls made like al@@ mon@@ ds in the other branch , with a K@@ no@@ p and a f@@ lower : so in the six branches that come out of the cand@@ le@@ stick .
and there shall be a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , and a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , and a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the cand@@ le@@ stick .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make lo@@ ops of blue upon the edge of the one cur@@ tain from the sel@@ v@@ edge in the cou@@ pling ; and likewise s@@ halt th@@ ou make in the ut@@ ter@@ most edge of another cur@@ tain , in the cou@@ pling of the second .

and th@@ ou s@@ halt make fif@@ ty lo@@ ops on the edge of the one cur@@ tain that is out@@ most in the cou@@ pling , and fif@@ ty lo@@ ops in the edge of the cur@@ tain which cou@@ ple@@ th the second .
and a cu@@ bit on the one side , and a cu@@ bit on the other side of that which remain@@ eth in the length of the cur@@ tains of the tent , it shall han@@ g over the sides of the tab@@ ern@@ acle on this side and on that side , to cover it .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt han@@ g up the v@@ ail under the t@@ aches , that th@@ ou may@@ est bring in th@@ ither within the v@@ ail the Ar@@ k of the testimony : and the v@@ ail shall divide un@@ to you between the hol@@ y place and the most hol@@ y .
and take th@@ ou un@@ to the@@ e Aaron TH@@ Y brother , and his sons with him , from among the children of Israel , that he may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office , even Aaron , Nad@@ a@@ b and A@@ bi@@ hu , Ele@@ azar and I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , Aaron 's sons .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to all that are wise hear@@ ted , whom I have filled with the spirit of wis@@ dom , that they may make Aaron 's gar@@ ments to consec@@ rate him , that he may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office .
and these are the gar@@ ments which they shall make ; a bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and an ep@@ ho@@ d , and a ro@@ be , and a bro@@ i@@ dered co@@ at , a Mit@@ re , and a gir@@ dle : and they shall make hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron TH@@ Y brother , and his sons , that he may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set in it sett@@ ings of stones , even four ro@@ ws of stones : the first row shall be a sar@@ di@@ us , a top@@ az , and a car@@ bun@@ cle : this shall be the first row .
and two other r@@ ings of gold th@@ ou s@@ halt make , and s@@ halt put them on the two sides of the ep@@ ho@@ d under@@ ne@@ ath , toward the fore@@ part there@@ of , over against the other cou@@ pling there@@ of , above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d .
and they shall bin@@ d the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te by the r@@ ings there@@ of un@@ to the r@@ ings of the ep@@ ho@@ d with a la@@ ce of blue , that it may be above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and that the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te be not lo@@ os@@ ed from the ep@@ ho@@ d .
and there shall be an hol@@ e in the top of it , in the mid@@ st there@@ of : it shall have a binding of w@@ ov@@ en work round about the hol@@ e of it , as it were the hol@@ e of an haber@@ ge@@ on , that it be not rent .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put them upon Aaron TH@@ Y brother , and his sons with him ; and s@@ halt ano@@ int them , and consec@@ rate them , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy them , that they may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the blood of the bul@@ lock , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar with TH@@ Y fin@@ ger , and p@@ our all the blood bes@@ ide the bottom of the alt@@ ar .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take all the f@@ at that cover@@ eth the in@@ wards , and the ca@@ ul that is above the li@@ ver , and the two kid@@ neys , and the f@@ at that is upon them , and bur@@ n them upon the alt@@ ar .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou kill the ram , and take of his blood , and put it upon the tip of the right e@@ ar of Aaron , and upon the tip of the right e@@ ar of his sons , and upon the thum@@ b of their right hand , and upon the great to@@ e of their right fo@@ ot , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le the blood upon the alt@@ ar round about .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the blood that is upon the alt@@ ar , and of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le it upon Aaron , and upon his gar@@ ments , and upon his sons , and upon the gar@@ ments of his sons with him : and he shall be hal@@ low@@ ed , and his gar@@ ments , and his sons , and his sons ' gar@@ ments with him .
also th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the ram the f@@ at and the rum@@ p , and the f@@ at that cover@@ eth the in@@ wards , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , and the two kid@@ neys , and the f@@ at that is upon them , and the right sho@@ ul@@ der ; for it is a ram of consec@@ ration :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt sanc@@ ti@@ fy the bre@@ ast of the wave offering , and the sho@@ ul@@ der of the he@@ ave offering , which is w@@ av@@ ed , and which is heav@@ ed up , of the ram of the consec@@ ration , even of that which is for Aaron , and of that which is for his sons :
and it shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel : for it is an he@@ ave offering : and it shall be an he@@ ave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offer@@ ings , even their he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt over@@ lay it with p@@ ure gold , the top there@@ of , and the sides there@@ of round about , and the hor@@ ns there@@ of ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt make un@@ to it a cro@@ wn of gold round about .
and two golden r@@ ings s@@ halt th@@ ou make to it under the cro@@ wn of it , by the two cor@@ ners there@@ of , upon the two sides of it s@@ halt th@@ ou make it ; and they shall be for places for the st@@ aves to bear it with@@ al .
when th@@ ou tak@@ est the sum of the children of Israel after their number , then shall they give every man a ran@@ so@@ m for his sou@@ l un@@ to the Lord , when th@@ ou num@@ ber@@ est them ; that there be no pla@@ gue among them , when th@@ ou num@@ ber@@ est them .
this they shall give , every one that pass@@ eth among them that are num@@ ber@@ ed , half a sh@@ ek@@ el after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary : ( a sh@@ ek@@ el is twenty ger@@ ah@@ s : ) an half sh@@ ek@@ el shall be the offering of the Lord .
and I , be@@ hold , I have given with him Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ a@@ b , the son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tri@@ be of Dan : and in the hear@@ ts of all that are wise hear@@ ted I have put wis@@ dom , that they may make all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e ;
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I comman@@ ded them : they have made them a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and have wor@@ shi@@ pped it , and have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed there@@ un@@ to , and said , These be TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Israel , which have brought the@@ e up out of the land of Egypt .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore should the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans speak , and say , For mis@@ chief did he bring them out , to s@@ lay them in the mountains , and to consum@@ e them from the face of the ear@@ th ? turn from TH@@ Y fierce wr@@ ath , and rep@@ ent of this ev@@ il against TH@@ Y people .
and Mos@@ es turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and it came to pass , as soon as he came n@@ igh un@@ to the camp , that he saw the cal@@ f , and the dan@@ cing : and Mos@@ es ' an@@ ger wa@@ xed hot , and he cast the tables out of his hands , and br@@ ake them ben@@ e@@ ath the mount .
and he took the cal@@ f which they had made , and bur@@ n@@ t it in the fire , and ground it to pow@@ der , and stra@@ wed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said un@@ to me , Mak@@ e us go@@ ds , which shall go before us : for as for this Mos@@ es , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wo@@ t not what is become of him .
and he said un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , P@@ ut every man his s@@ word by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and s@@ lay every man his brother , and every man his compan@@ ion , and every man his neighbour .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es went out un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Mos@@ es , until he was gone into the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es face to face , as a man speak@@ eth un@@ to his friend . and he turned again into the camp : but his ser@@ vant Jos@@ hua , the son of nun , a young man , depar@@ ted not out of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and it shall come to pass , while my gl@@ ory pass@@ eth by , that I will put the@@ e in a cli@@ ft of the rock , and will cover the@@ e with my hand while I pass by :
and he he@@ wed two tables of stone like un@@ to the first ; and Mos@@ es rose up early in the morning , and went up un@@ to mount S@@ ina@@ i , as the Lord had comman@@ ded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es came down from mount S@@ ina@@ i with the two tables of testimony in Mos@@ es ' hand , when he came down from the mount , that Mos@@ es w@@ ist not that the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one while he talked with him .
and they came , every one whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the Lord 's offering to the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and for all his service , and for the hol@@ y gar@@ ments .
and all the women that were wise hear@@ ted did sp@@ in with their hands , and brought that which they had sp@@ un , both of blue , and of pur@@ ple , and of scar@@ let , and of fine lin@@ en .
the children of Israel brought a willing offering un@@ to the Lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had comman@@ ded to be made by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and he made lo@@ ops of blue on the edge of one cur@@ tain from the sel@@ v@@ edge in the cou@@ pling : likewise he made in the ut@@ ter@@ most side of another cur@@ tain , in the cou@@ pling of the second .
and he made fif@@ ty lo@@ ops upon the ut@@ ter@@ most edge of the cur@@ tain in the cou@@ pling , and fif@@ ty lo@@ ops made he upon the edge of the cur@@ tain which cou@@ ple@@ th the second .
and B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el made the Ar@@ k of sh@@ it@@ tim wood : two cu@@ bi@@ ts and a half was the length of it , and a cu@@ bit and a half the b@@ read@@ th of it , and a cu@@ bit and a half the he@@ ight of it :
and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms spread out their w@@ ings on high , and covered with their w@@ ings over the mer@@ cy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mer@@ cy se@@ at@@ ward were the faces of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms .
three bo@@ w@@ ls made after the fashion of al@@ mon@@ ds in one branch , a K@@ no@@ p and a f@@ lower ; and three bo@@ w@@ ls made like al@@ mon@@ ds in another branch , a K@@ no@@ p and a f@@ lower : so throughout the six branches going out of the cand@@ le@@ stick .
and he made the incen@@ se alt@@ ar of sh@@ it@@ tim wood : the length of it was a cu@@ bit , and the b@@ read@@ th of it a cu@@ bit ; it was fo@@ ur@@ square ; and two cu@@ bi@@ ts was the he@@ ight of it ; the hor@@ ns there@@ of were of the same .
and he over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold , both the top of it , and the sides there@@ of round about , and the hor@@ ns of it : also he made un@@ to it a cro@@ wn of gold round about .
and he made all the vessels of the alt@@ ar , the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons , and the fle@@ sh@@ ho@@ oks , and the fi@@ rep@@ ans : all the vessels there@@ of made he of br@@ ass .
and he made the lav@@ er of br@@ ass , and the fo@@ ot of it of br@@ ass , of the lo@@ ok@@ ing@@ gl@@ ass@@ es of the women assemb@@ ling , which assemb@@ led at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the so@@ c@@ kets for the pil@@ lars were of br@@ ass ; the ho@@ oks of the pil@@ lars and their fil@@ lets of silver ; and the over@@ lay@@ ing of their chap@@ it@@ ers of silver ; and all the pil@@ lars of the court were fil@@ le@@ ted with silver .
and the han@@ ging for the gate of the court was ne@@ ed@@ le@@ work , of blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en : and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts was the length , and the he@@ ight in the b@@ read@@ th was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , answ@@ er@@ able to the han@@ g@@ ings of the court .
this is the sum of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , even of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of testimony , as it was counted , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mos@@ es , for the service of the L@@ evi@@ tes , by the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , son to Aaron the pri@@ est .
all the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the hol@@ y place , even the gold of the offering , was twenty and nine tal@@ ents , and seven hundred and thirty sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
and they did beat the gold into th@@ in plates , and cut it into wi@@ res , to work it in the blue , and in the pur@@ ple , and in the scar@@ let , and in the fine lin@@ en , with c@@ un@@ ning work .
and they made two other golden r@@ ings , and put them on the two sides of the ep@@ ho@@ d under@@ ne@@ ath , toward the fore@@ part of it , over against the other cou@@ pling there@@ of , above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d .
and they did bin@@ d the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te by his r@@ ings un@@ to the r@@ ings of the ep@@ ho@@ d with a la@@ ce of blue , that it might be above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and that the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te might not be lo@@ os@@ ed from the ep@@ ho@@ d ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring in the cand@@ le@@ stick , and light the lam@@ ps there@@ of .
and he shall kill the bul@@ lock before the Lord : and the pri@@ ests , Aaron 's sons , shall bring the blood , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le the blood round about upon the alt@@ ar that is by the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the pri@@ ests , Aaron 's sons , shall lay the parts , the head , and the f@@ at , in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the alt@@ ar :
and he shall bring it to Aaron 's sons the pri@@ ests : and he shall take there@@ out his hand@@ ful of the fl@@ our there@@ of , and of the oil there@@ of , with all the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se there@@ of ; and the pri@@ est shall bur@@ n the memorial of it upon the alt@@ ar , to be an offering made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord :
and if th@@ ou offer a meat offering of TH@@ Y fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its un@@ to the Lord , th@@ ou s@@ halt offer for the meat offering of TH@@ Y fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its green e@@ ars of cor@@ n dri@@ ed by the fire , even cor@@ n beaten out of full e@@ ars .
and the two kid@@ neys , and the f@@ at that is on them , which is by the f@@ lan@@ ks , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , with the kid@@ neys , it shall he take away .
and Aaron 's sons shall bur@@ n it on the alt@@ ar upon the bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , which is upon the wood that is on the fire : it is an offering made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord .
and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord ; the f@@ at there@@ of , and the whole rum@@ p , it shall he take off hard by the back@@ bone ; and the f@@ at that cover@@ eth the in@@ wards , and all the f@@ at that is upon the in@@ wards ,
and the two kid@@ neys , and the f@@ at that is upon them , which is by the f@@ lan@@ ks , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , with the kid@@ neys , it shall he take away .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , If a sou@@ l shall sin through ignor@@ ance against any of the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them :
if the pri@@ est that is ano@@ in@@ ted do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hat@@ h sin@@ ned , a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h un@@ to the Lord for a sin offering .
and the pri@@ est shall put some of the blood upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar of swe@@ et incen@@ se before the Lord , which is in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and shall p@@ our all the blood of the bul@@ lock at the bottom of the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering , which is at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the two kid@@ neys , and the f@@ at that is upon them , which is by the f@@ lan@@ ks , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , with the kid@@ neys , it shall he take away ,
and if the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel sin through ignor@@ ance , and the thing be hi@@ d from the eyes of the assembly , and they have done somewhat against any of the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord concerning things which should not be done , and are guilty ;
and he shall put some of the blood upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar which is before the Lord , that is in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and shall p@@ our out all the blood at the bottom of the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering , which is at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and he shall do with the bul@@ lock as he did with the bul@@ lock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for them , and it shall be for@@ given them .
and the pri@@ est shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his fin@@ ger , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , and shall p@@ our out his blood at the bottom of the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering .
and he shall bur@@ n all his f@@ at upon the alt@@ ar , as the f@@ at of the sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings : and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be for@@ given him .
or if his sin , which he hat@@ h sin@@ ned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a k@@ id of the go@@ ats , a female without ble@@ mis@@ h , for his sin which he hat@@ h sin@@ ned .

and the pri@@ est shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his fin@@ ger , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , and shall p@@ our out all the blood there@@ of at the bottom of the alt@@ ar :

and if he be not able to bring a lam@@ b , then he shall bring for his t@@ res@@ pass , which he hat@@ h committed , two tur@@ t@@ led@@ ov@@ es , or two young pi@@ ge@@ ons , un@@ to the Lord ; one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering .
and he shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the alt@@ ar ; and the rest of the blood shall be wr@@ ung out at the bottom of the alt@@ ar : it is a sin offering .
then shall he bring it to the pri@@ est , and the pri@@ est shall take his hand@@ ful of it , even a memorial there@@ of , and bur@@ n it on the alt@@ ar , according to the offer@@ ings made by fire un@@ to the Lord : it is a sin offering .
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him as tou@@ ching his sin that he hat@@ h sin@@ ned in one of these , and it shall be for@@ given him : and the re@@ mn@@ ant shall be the pri@@ est 's , as a meat offering .

this is the portion of the ano@@ in@@ ting of Aaron , and of the ano@@ in@@ ting of his sons , out of the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister un@@ to the Lord in the pri@@ est 's office ;
this is the law of the bur@@ n@@ t offering , of the meat offering , and of the sin offering , and of the t@@ res@@ pass offering , and of the consec@@ r@@ ations , and of the sacrifice of the peace offer@@ ings ;
and he put upon him the co@@ at , and gir@@ ded him with the gir@@ dle , and clo@@ th@@ ed him with the ro@@ be , and put the ep@@ ho@@ d upon him , and he gir@@ ded him with the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and bound it un@@ to him there@@ with .
and he sle@@ w it ; and Mos@@ es took the blood , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar round about with his fin@@ ger , and pur@@ ified the alt@@ ar , and p@@ oured the blood at the bottom of the alt@@ ar , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , to make reconciliation upon it .
and he sle@@ w it ; and Mos@@ es took of the blood of it , and put it upon the tip of Aaron 's right e@@ ar , and upon the thum@@ b of his right hand , and upon the great to@@ e of his right fo@@ ot .
and he brought Aaron 's sons , and Mos@@ es put of the blood upon the tip of their right e@@ ar , and upon the thum@@ bs of their right hands , and upon the great to@@ es of their right feet : and Mos@@ es sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood upon the alt@@ ar round about .
and out of the bas@@ ket of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , that was before the Lord , he took one un@@ le@@ av@@ ened c@@ ake , and a c@@ ake of o@@ iled bread , and one w@@ af@@ er , and put them on the f@@ at , and upon the right sho@@ ul@@ der :
and Mos@@ es took of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and of the blood which was upon the alt@@ ar , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it upon Aaron , and upon his gar@@ ments , and upon his sons , and upon his sons ' gar@@ ments with him ; and sanc@@ ti@@ fied Aaron , and his gar@@ ments , and his sons , and his sons ' gar@@ ments with him .
and the sons of Aaron brought the blood un@@ to him : and he di@@ pped his fin@@ ger in the blood , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar , and p@@ oured out the blood at the bottom of the alt@@ ar :
and all that have not fin@@ s and scal@@ es in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to you :
even these of them ye may eat ; the loc@@ ust after his kind , and the bal@@ d loc@@ ust after his kind , and the be@@ etle after his kind , and the gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ per after his kind .
of all meat which may be e@@ aten , that on which such water co@@ me@@ th shall be un@@ clean : and all drink that may be dr@@ un@@ k in every such ves@@ sel shall be un@@ clean .
when a man shall have in the s@@ kin of his f@@ les@@ h a rising , a sc@@ a@@ b , or a bright spot , and it be in the s@@ kin of his f@@ les@@ h like the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy ; then he shall be brought un@@ to Aaron the pri@@ est , or un@@ to one of his sons the pri@@ ests :
and the pri@@ est shall look on the pla@@ gue in the s@@ kin of the f@@ les@@ h : and when the ha@@ ir in the pla@@ gue is turned white , and the pla@@ gue in sight be deeper than the s@@ kin of his f@@ les@@ h , it is a pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy : and the pri@@ est shall look on him , and pron@@ oun@@ ce him un@@ clean .
if the bright spot be white in the s@@ kin of his f@@ les@@ h , and in sight be not deeper than the s@@ kin , and the ha@@ ir there@@ of be not turned white ; then the pri@@ est shall shut up him that hat@@ h the pla@@ gue seven days :

and the pri@@ est shall look on him again the seventh day : and , be@@ hold , if the pla@@ gue be somewhat dark , and the pla@@ gue spread not in the s@@ kin , the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean : it is but a sc@@ a@@ b : and he shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be clean .
and if a le@@ pro@@ sy break out abroad in the s@@ kin , and the le@@ pro@@ sy cover all the s@@ kin of him that hat@@ h the pla@@ gue from his head even to his fo@@ ot , wher@@ es@@ o@@ ever the pri@@ est lo@@ ok@@ eth ;
then the pri@@ est shall consider : and , be@@ hold , if the le@@ pro@@ sy have covered all his f@@ les@@ h , he shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean that hat@@ h the pla@@ gue : it is all turned white : he is clean .
and if , when the pri@@ est se@@ eth it , be@@ hold , it be in sight lower than the s@@ kin , and the ha@@ ir there@@ of be turned white ; the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him un@@ clean : it is a pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy broken out of the bo@@ il .
but if the pri@@ est look on it , and , be@@ hold , there be no white ha@@ ir in the bright spot , and it be no lower than the other s@@ kin , but be somewhat dark ; then the pri@@ est shall shut him up seven days :
and if the pri@@ est look on the pla@@ gue of the sc@@ all , and , be@@ hold , it be not in sight deeper than the s@@ kin , and that there is no black ha@@ ir in it ; then the pri@@ est shall shut up him that hat@@ h the pla@@ gue of the sc@@ all seven days :
and in the seventh day the pri@@ est shall look on the pla@@ gue : and , be@@ hold , if the sc@@ all spread not , and there be in it no yel@@ low ha@@ ir , and the sc@@ all be not in sight deeper than the s@@ kin ;
and in the seventh day the pri@@ est shall look on the sc@@ all : and , be@@ hold , if the sc@@ all be not spread in the s@@ kin , nor be in sight deeper than the s@@ kin ; then the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean : and he shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be clean .
and if the pla@@ gue be green@@ ish or red@@ dish in the gar@@ ment , or in the s@@ kin , either in the war@@ p , or in the wo@@ of , or in any thing of s@@ kin ; it is a pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , and shall be she@@ wed un@@ to the pri@@ est :
and he shall look on the pla@@ gue on the seventh day : if the pla@@ gue be spread in the gar@@ ment , either in the war@@ p , or in the wo@@ of , or in a s@@ kin , or in any work that is made of s@@ kin ; the pla@@ gue is a fre@@ t@@ ting le@@ pro@@ sy ; it is un@@ clean .
and if the pri@@ est look , and , be@@ hold , the pla@@ gue be somewhat dark after the w@@ ashing of it ; then he shall ren@@ d it out of the gar@@ ment , or out of the s@@ kin , or out of the war@@ p , or out of the wo@@ of :
and if it appear still in the gar@@ ment , either in the war@@ p , or in the wo@@ of , or in any thing of s@@ kin ; it is a spreading pla@@ gue : th@@ ou s@@ halt bur@@ n that where@@ in the pla@@ gue is with fire .

and the pri@@ est shall go forth out of the camp ; and the pri@@ est shall look , and , be@@ hold , if the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy be he@@ aled in the le@@ per ;
as for the living bird , he shall take it , and the c@@ ed@@ ar wood , and the scar@@ let , and the hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water :
and he that is to be cleans@@ ed shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and s@@ have off all his ha@@ ir , and was@@ h himself in water , that he may be clean : and after that he shall come into the camp , and shall tar@@ ry abroad out of his tent seven days .
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall s@@ have all his ha@@ ir off his head and his be@@ ard and his eye@@ bro@@ ws , even all his ha@@ ir he shall s@@ have off : and he shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , also he shall was@@ h his f@@ les@@ h in water , and he shall be clean .
and he shall s@@ lay the lam@@ b in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the bur@@ n@@ t offering , in the hol@@ y place : for as the sin offering is the pri@@ est 's , so is the t@@ res@@ pass offering : it is most hol@@ y :
and the pri@@ est shall take some of the blood of the t@@ res@@ pass offering , and the pri@@ est shall put it upon the tip of the right e@@ ar of him that is to be cleans@@ ed , and upon the thum@@ b of his right hand , and upon the great to@@ e of his right fo@@ ot :
and the pri@@ est shall dip his right fin@@ ger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le of the oil with his fin@@ ger seven times before the Lord :
and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the pri@@ est put upon the tip of the right e@@ ar of him that is to be cleans@@ ed , and upon the thum@@ b of his right hand , and upon the great to@@ e of his right fo@@ ot , upon the blood of the t@@ res@@ pass offering :

and he shall kill the lam@@ b of the t@@ res@@ pass offering , and the pri@@ est shall take some of the blood of the t@@ res@@ pass offering , and put it upon the tip of the right e@@ ar of him that is to be cleans@@ ed , and upon the thum@@ b of his right hand , and upon the great to@@ e of his right fo@@ ot :

and the rest of the oil that is in the pri@@ est 's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleans@@ ed , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for him before the Lord .
then the pri@@ est shall command that they empty the house , before the pri@@ est go into it to see the pla@@ gue , that all that is in the house be not made un@@ clean : and after@@ ward the pri@@ est shall go in to see the house :
and if the pla@@ gue come again , and break out in the house , after that he hat@@ h taken away the stones , and after he hat@@ h sc@@ ra@@ ped the house , and after it is pla@@ ist@@ ered ;
and he shall break down the house , the stones of it , and the tim@@ ber there@@ of , and all the mor@@ ter of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an un@@ clean place .
and if the pri@@ est shall come in , and look upon it , and , be@@ hold , the pla@@ gue hat@@ h not spread in the house , after the house was pla@@ ist@@ ered : then the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce the house clean , because the pla@@ gue is he@@ aled .
and he shall take the c@@ ed@@ ar wood , and the hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and the scar@@ let , and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the sla@@ in bird , and in the running water , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le the house seven times :
he shall put on the hol@@ y lin@@ en co@@ at , and he shall have the lin@@ en bre@@ eches upon his f@@ les@@ h , and shall be gir@@ ded with a lin@@ en gir@@ dle , and with the lin@@ en Mit@@ re shall he be at@@ ti@@ red : these are hol@@ y gar@@ ments ; therefore shall he was@@ h his f@@ les@@ h in water , and so put them on .
but the go@@ at , on which the lot fell to be the s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at , shall be presented alive before the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement with him , and to let him go for a s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and he shall take of the blood of the bul@@ lock , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le it with his fin@@ ger upon the mer@@ cy seat eas@@ tw@@ ard ; and before the mer@@ cy seat shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le of the blood with his fin@@ ger seven times .
then shall he kill the go@@ at of the sin offering , that is for the people , and bring his blood within the v@@ ail , and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bul@@ lock , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le it upon the mer@@ cy seat , and before the mer@@ cy seat :
and he shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for the hol@@ y place , because of the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of the children of Israel , and because of their trans@@ gres@@ sions in all their sin@@ s : and so shall he do for the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , that remain@@ eth among them in the mid@@ st of their un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess .
and there shall be no man in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation when he go@@ eth in to make an At@@ on@@ ement in the hol@@ y place , until he come out , and have made an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for his household , and for all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel .
and he shall go out un@@ to the alt@@ ar that is before the Lord , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for it ; and shall take of the blood of the bul@@ lock , and of the blood of the go@@ at , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar round about .
and he shall was@@ h his f@@ les@@ h with water in the hol@@ y place , and put on his gar@@ ments , and come forth , and offer his bur@@ n@@ t offering , and the bur@@ n@@ t offering of the people , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for the people .
and the bul@@ lock for the sin offering , and the go@@ at for the sin offering , whose blood was brought in to make At@@ on@@ ement in the hol@@ y place , shall one carry forth without the camp ; and they shall bur@@ n in the fire their sk@@ ins , and their f@@ les@@ h , and their D@@ ung .
and this shall be a statute for ever un@@ to you : that in the seventh month , on the tenth day of the month , ye shall aff@@ lic@@ t your so@@ ul@@ s , and do no work at all , whether it be one of your own country , or a st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among you :
and the pri@@ est , whom he shall ano@@ int , and whom he shall consec@@ rate to minister in the pri@@ est 's office in his father 's stead , shall make the At@@ on@@ ement , and shall put on the lin@@ en clo@@ th@@ es , even the hol@@ y gar@@ ments :
and he shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for the hol@@ y sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and he shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and for the alt@@ ar , and he shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for the pri@@ ests , and for all the people of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and br@@ ing@@ eth it not un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to offer an offering un@@ to the Lord before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; blood shall be imp@@ uted un@@ to that man ; he hat@@ h shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people :
to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , which they offer in the open field , even that they may bring them un@@ to the Lord , un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , un@@ to the pri@@ est , and offer them for peace offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the st@@ ran@@ gers that so@@ jour@@ n among you , that e@@ ate@@ th any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that sou@@ l that e@@ ate@@ th blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man there be of the children of Israel , or of the st@@ ran@@ gers that so@@ jour@@ n among you , which hun@@ te@@ th and cat@@ ch@@ eth any be@@ ast or fo@@ w@@ l that may be e@@ aten ; he shall even p@@ our out the blood there@@ of , and cover it with d@@ ust .
after the do@@ ings of the land of Egypt , where@@ in ye d@@ wel@@ t , shall ye not do : and after the do@@ ings of the land of Can@@ a@@ an , w@@ hi@@ ther I bring you , shall ye not do : neither shall ye walk in their ord@@ inan@@ ces .
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him with the ram of the t@@ res@@ pass offering before the Lord for his sin which he hat@@ h done : and the sin which he hat@@ h done shall be for@@ given him .
and when ye shall come into the land , and shall have plan@@ ted all manner of trees for food , then ye shall count the fruit there@@ of as un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised : three years shall it be as un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised un@@ to you : it shall not be e@@ aten of .
but the st@@ ran@@ ger that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th with you shall be un@@ to you as one born among you , and th@@ ou s@@ halt love him as th@@ y@@ self ; for ye were st@@ ran@@ gers in the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .

and if a man shall lie with a woman having her si@@ ck@@ ness , and shall un@@ cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess ; he hat@@ h discovered her fo@@ un@@ tain , and she hat@@ h uncovered the fo@@ un@@ tain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
Y@@ e shall therefore put difference between clean be@@ asts and un@@ clean , and between un@@ clean fo@@ w@@ ls and clean : and ye shall not make your so@@ ul@@ s ab@@ omin@@ able by be@@ ast , or by fo@@ w@@ l , or by any manner of living thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth on the ground , which I have separated from you as un@@ clean .
say un@@ to them , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever he be of all your se@@ ed among your generations , that go@@ eth un@@ to the hol@@ y things , which the children of Israel hal@@ low un@@ to the Lord , having his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess upon him , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from my presence : I am the Lord .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye be come into the land which I give un@@ to you , and shall re@@ ap the har@@ v@@ est there@@ of , then ye shall bring a she@@ af of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of your har@@ v@@ est un@@ to the pri@@ est :
and ye shall offer with the bread seven lam@@ bs without ble@@ mis@@ h of the first year , and one young bul@@ lock , and two r@@ ams : they shall be for a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord , with their meat offering , and their drink offer@@ ings , even an offering made by fire , of swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord .
and when ye re@@ ap the har@@ v@@ est of your land , th@@ ou s@@ halt not make clean rid@@ dance of the cor@@ ners of TH@@ Y field when th@@ ou re@@ ap@@ est , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou gather any g@@ le@@ an@@ ing of TH@@ Y har@@ v@@ est : th@@ ou s@@ halt leave them un@@ to the poor , and to the st@@ ran@@ ger : I am the Lord your God .
seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord : on the eighth day shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation un@@ to you ; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord : it is a so@@ lem@@ n assembly ; and ye shall do no serv@@ ile work there@@ in .
also in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the seventh month , when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land , ye shall keep a feast un@@ to the Lord seven days : on the first day shall be a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , and on the eighth day shall be a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
and the son of an Isra@@ el@@ iti@@ sh woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Isra@@ el@@ iti@@ sh woman and a man of Israel stro@@ ve together in the camp ;

and he that b@@ las@@ phe@@ me@@ th the name of the Lord , he shall su@@ rely be put to death , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall certainly stone him : as well the st@@ ran@@ ger , as he that is born in the land , when he b@@ las@@ phe@@ me@@ th the name of the Lord , shall be put to death .
and ye shall hal@@ low the fif@@ ti@@ eth year , and procla@@ im liber@@ ty throughout all the land un@@ to all the inhabitants there@@ of : it shall be a j@@ ub@@ ile un@@ to you ; and ye shall return every man un@@ to his possession , and ye shall return every man un@@ to his family .
according to the multi@@ tude of years th@@ ou s@@ halt increase the price there@@ of , and according to the fe@@ w@@ ness of years th@@ ou s@@ halt dimin@@ ish the price of it : for according to the number of the years of the fru@@ its do@@ th he sell un@@ to the@@ e .
and if a man purchase of the L@@ evi@@ tes , then the house that was sold , and the city of his possession , shall go out in the year of j@@ ub@@ ile : for the houses of the cities of the L@@ evi@@ tes are their possession among the children of Israel .
and then shall he de@@ part from the@@ e , both he and his children with him , and shall return un@@ to his own family , and un@@ to the possession of his fa@@ thers shall he return .
moreover of the children of the st@@ ran@@ gers that do so@@ jour@@ n among you , of them shall ye buy , and of their families that are with you , which they beg@@ at in your land : and they shall be your possession .
and ye shall take them as an inher@@ it@@ ance for your children after you , to inher@@ it them for a possession ; they shall be your bon@@ d@@ men for ever : but over your bre@@ th@@ ren the children of Israel , ye shall not rule one over another with ri@@ g@@ our .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid ev@@ il be@@ asts out of the land , neither shall the s@@ word go through your land .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bon@@ d@@ men ; and I have broken the bands of your yok@@ e , and made you go u@@ pri@@ ght .
and I will bring a s@@ word upon you , that shall av@@ en@@ ge the quar@@ rel of my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , I will send the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
and they that are left of you shall p@@ ine away in their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in your enem@@ ies ' lands ; and also in the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fa@@ thers shall they p@@ ine away with them .
the land also shall be left of them , and shall enjoy her sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , while she li@@ eth de@@ so@@ late without them : and they shall accept of the punishment of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : because , even because they desp@@ ised my judg@@ ments , and because their sou@@ l ab@@ hor@@ red my stat@@ utes .
and if it be from a month old even un@@ to five years old , then TH@@ Y esti@@ mation shall be of the male five sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and for the female TH@@ Y esti@@ mation shall be three sh@@ ek@@ els of silver .

and when the tab@@ ern@@ acle set@@ te@@ th forward , the L@@ evi@@ tes shall take it down : and when the tab@@ ern@@ acle is to be pit@@ ched , the L@@ evi@@ tes shall set it up : and the st@@ ran@@ ger that co@@ me@@ th n@@ igh shall be put to death .

these are those which were num@@ ber@@ ed of the children of Israel by the house of their fa@@ thers : all those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fif@@ ty .
those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , according to the number of all the mal@@ es , from a month old and up@@ ward , even those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them were seven thousand and five hundred .

at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites , in all their bur@@ den@@ s , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint un@@ to them in charge all their bur@@ den@@ s .
from thirty years old and up@@ ward even un@@ to fif@@ ty years old s@@ halt th@@ ou number them , every one that enter@@ eth into the service , to do the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .

these were they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , all that might do service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , which Mos@@ es and Aaron did number according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
these are they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the families of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of all that might do service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , whom Mos@@ es and Aaron did number according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .
then they shall conf@@ ess their sin which they have done : and he shall re@@ compen@@ se his t@@ res@@ pass with the principal there@@ of , and add un@@ to it the fifth part there@@ of , and give it un@@ to him against whom he hat@@ h t@@ res@@ passed .
and a man lie with her car@@ n@@ ally , and it be hi@@ d from the eyes of her husband , and be kept close , and she be def@@ iled , and there be no witness against her , neither she be taken with the manner ;
and the pri@@ est shall set the woman before the Lord , and un@@ cover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the je@@ al@@ ous@@ y offering : and the pri@@ est shall have in his hand the bitter water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se :
then the pri@@ est shall charge the woman with an oath of cur@@ sing , and the pri@@ est shall say un@@ to the woman , The Lord make the@@ e a cur@@ se and an oath among TH@@ Y people , when the Lord do@@ th make TH@@ Y th@@ igh to ro@@ t , and TH@@ Y bel@@ ly to s@@ well ;
all the days of the vo@@ w of his separation there shall no ras@@ or come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separ@@ ate@@ th himself un@@ to the Lord , he shall be hol@@ y , and shall let the loc@@ ks of the ha@@ ir of his head grow .
and the N@@ azar@@ ite shall s@@ have the head of his separation at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and shall take the ha@@ ir of the head of his separation , and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offer@@ ings .
and it came to pass on the day that Mos@@ es had fully set up the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and had ano@@ in@@ ted it , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , and all the instruments there@@ of , both the alt@@ ar and all the vessels there@@ of , and had ano@@ in@@ ted them , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied them ;
and this work of the cand@@ le@@ stick was of beaten gold , un@@ to the S@@ haf@@ t there@@ of , un@@ to the flowers there@@ of , was beaten work : according un@@ to the pat@@ tern which the Lord had she@@ wed Mos@@ es , so he made the cand@@ le@@ stick .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bul@@ loc@@ ks : and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , un@@ to the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for the L@@ evi@@ tes .
in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of this month , at even , ye shall keep it in his appointed season : according to all the ri@@ tes of it , and according to all the ceremon@@ ies there@@ of , shall ye keep it .
and there were certain men , who were def@@ iled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the pass@@ over on that day : and they came before Mos@@ es and before Aaron on that day :
but the man that is clean , and is not in a journey , and for@@ be@@ aret@@ h to keep the pass@@ over , even the same sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people : because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
and on the day that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was re@@ ar@@ ed up the cl@@ oud covered the tab@@ ern@@ acle , name@@ ly , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
and when the cl@@ oud was taken up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle , then after that the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed : and in the place where the cl@@ oud abo@@ de , there the children of Israel pit@@ ched their ten@@ ts .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they rested in the ten@@ ts , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they jour@@ ne@@ yed : they kept the charge of the Lord , at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that op@@ pres@@ set@@ h you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the tr@@ ump@@ ets ; and ye shall be remember@@ ed before the Lord your God , and ye shall be sav@@ ed from your enem@@ ies .
and it shall be , if th@@ ou go with us , ye@@ a , it shall be , that what Go@@ od@@ ness the Lord shall do un@@ to us , the same will we do un@@ to the@@ e .
and when the people complained , it disp@@ le@@ ased the Lord : and the Lord heard it ; and his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led ; and the fire of the Lord bur@@ n@@ t among them , and consu@@ med them that were in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the camp .
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mil@@ ls , or beat it in a mort@@ ar , and bak@@ ed it in p@@ ans , and made cak@@ es of it : and the tas@@ te of it was as the tas@@ te of fresh oil .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , G@@ ather un@@ to me sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of Israel , whom th@@ ou know@@ est to be the el@@ ders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , that they may stand there with the@@ e .
and I will come down and talk with the@@ e there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon the@@ e , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with the@@ e , that th@@ ou bear it not th@@ y@@ self alone .
and the Lord came down in a cl@@ oud , and sp@@ ake un@@ to him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it un@@ to the sev@@ enty el@@ ders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , and did not ce@@ ase .
and there went forth a wind from the Lord , and brought qu@@ ails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , as it were a day 's journey on this side , and as it were a day 's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it were two cu@@ bi@@ ts high upon the face of the ear@@ th .
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the qu@@ ails : he that gathered least gathered ten hom@@ ers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and they went and came to Mos@@ es , and to Aaron , and to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , un@@ to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an , to K@@ ade@@ sh ; and brought back word un@@ to them , and un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and she@@ wed them the fruit of the land .
because all those men which have seen my gl@@ ory , and my mir@@ ac@@ les , which I did in Egypt and in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and have temp@@ ted me now these ten times , and have not hear@@ ken@@ ed to my voice ;
and will make an offering by fire un@@ to the Lord , a bur@@ n@@ t offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vo@@ w , or in a fre@@ e@@ will offering , or in your so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts , to make a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord , of the her@@ d , or of the flock :
then it shall be , if ought be committed by ignor@@ ance without the knowledge of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , that all the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall offer one young bul@@ lock for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , for a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord , with his meat offering , and his drink offering , according to the manner , and one k@@ id of the go@@ ats for a sin offering .
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , and it shall be for@@ given them ; for it is ignor@@ ance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire un@@ to the Lord , and their sin offering before the Lord , for their ignor@@ ance :
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for the sou@@ l that sin@@ net@@ h ignor@@ antly , when he sin@@ net@@ h by ignor@@ ance before the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for him ; and it shall be for@@ given him .
and it shall be un@@ to you for a f@@ rin@@ ge , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord , and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a wh@@ oring :
so they g@@ at up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Kor@@ ah , Da@@ than , and A@@ bi@@ ram , on every side : and Da@@ than and A@@ bi@@ ram came out , and stood in the door of their ten@@ ts , and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their little children .
and it came to pass , when the Con@@ gre@@ gation was gathered against Mos@@ es and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and , be@@ hold , the cl@@ oud covered it , and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and take of every one of them a ro@@ d according to the house of their fa@@ thers , of all their pr@@ inces according to the house of their fa@@ thers twelve ro@@ ds : write th@@ ou every man 's name upon his ro@@ d .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's ro@@ d , whom I shall choose , shall b@@ los@@ so@@ m : and I will make to ce@@ ase from me the mur@@ mur@@ ings of the children of Israel , where@@ by they mur@@ mur against you .
and I , be@@ hold , I have taken your bre@@ th@@ ren the L@@ evi@@ tes from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Aaron , be@@ hold , I also have given the@@ e the charge of mine he@@ ave offer@@ ings of all the hal@@ low@@ ed things of the children of Israel ; un@@ to the@@ e have I given them by reason of the ano@@ in@@ ting , and to TH@@ Y sons , by an ordin@@ ance for ever .
this shall be th@@ ine of the most hol@@ y things , reserved from the fire : every ob@@ lation of the@@ ir@@ s , every meat offering of the@@ ir@@ s , and every sin offering of the@@ ir@@ s , and every t@@ res@@ pass offering of the@@ ir@@ s , which they shall ren@@ der un@@ to me , shall be most hol@@ y for the@@ e and for TH@@ Y sons .
all the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of them which they shall offer un@@ to the Lord , them have I given the@@ e .
thus speak un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes , and say un@@ to them , When ye take of the children of Israel the ti@@ th@@ es which I have given you from them for your inher@@ it@@ ance , then ye shall offer up an he@@ ave offering of it for the Lord , even a tenth part of the ti@@ the .
thus ye also shall offer an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord of all your ti@@ th@@ es , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give there@@ of the Lord 's he@@ ave offering to Aaron the pri@@ est .
this is the ordin@@ ance of the law which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , saying , Spe@@ ak un@@ to the children of Israel , that they bring the@@ e a red he@@ if@@ er without spot , where@@ in is no ble@@ mis@@ h , and upon which never came yok@@ e :
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth the dead body of any man that is dead , and pur@@ i@@ fi@@ eth not himself , def@@ il@@ eth the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from Israel : because the water of separation was not sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led upon him , he shall be un@@ clean ; his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess is yet upon him .
but the man that shall be un@@ clean , and shall not pur@@ ify himself , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among the Con@@ gre@@ gation , because he hat@@ h def@@ iled the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord : the water of separation hat@@ h not been sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led upon him ; he is un@@ clean .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation , into the de@@ sert of Z@@ in in the first month : and the people abo@@ de in K@@ ade@@ sh ; and Mi@@ ri@@ am died there , and was buried there .
and the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord standing in the way , and his s@@ word drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Bal@@ a@@ am smo@@ te the ass , to turn her into the way .
then the Lord opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the an@@ gel of the Lord standing in the way , and his s@@ word drawn in his hand : and he bo@@ wed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and , be@@ hold , one of the children of Israel came and brought un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren a Mi@@ di@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman in the sight of Mos@@ es , and in the sight of all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , who were we@@ eping before the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
now the name of the Isra@@ elite that was sla@@ in , even that was sla@@ in with the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman , was Z@@ im@@ ri , the son of Sal@@ u , a pr@@ ince of a chief house among the Sime@@ on@@ ites .
and the sons of Eli@@ a@@ b ; Nem@@ uel , and Da@@ than , and A@@ bi@@ ram . this is that Da@@ than and A@@ bi@@ ram , which were famous in the Con@@ gre@@ gation , who stro@@ ve against Mos@@ es and against Aaron in the company of Kor@@ ah , when they stro@@ ve against the Lord :
which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord be not as she@@ ep which have no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
and he shall stand before Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , who shall ask coun@@ sel for him after the judgment of U@@ rim before the Lord : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and their drink offer@@ ings shall be half an hin of wine un@@ to a bul@@ lock , and the third part of an hin un@@ to a ram , and a fourth part of an hin un@@ to a lam@@ b : this is the bur@@ n@@ t offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
but if her husband dis@@ allowed her on the day that he heard it ; then he shall make her vo@@ w which she vowed , and that which she ut@@ tered with her li@@ ps , where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l , of none effect : and the Lord shall for@@ give her .
but if her husband hat@@ h ut@@ ter@@ ly made them vo@@ id on the day he heard them ; then wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever proce@@ eded out of her li@@ ps concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her sou@@ l , shall not stand : her husband hat@@ h made them vo@@ id ; and the Lord shall for@@ give her .
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day ; then he establis@@ het@@ h all her vows , or all her bonds , which are upon her : he confir@@ me@@ th them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
and they sle@@ w the kings of Mi@@ dian , bes@@ ide the rest of them that were sla@@ in ; name@@ ly , Evi , and Rek@@ em , and Z@@ ur , and H@@ ur , and Re@@ ba , five kings of Mi@@ dian : Bal@@ a@@ am also the son of Be@@ or they sle@@ w with the s@@ word .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Mi@@ dian cap@@ tives , and their little ones , and took the sp@@ oil of all their c@@ attle , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks , and all their goods .
and they brought the cap@@ tives , and the pre@@ y , and the sp@@ oil , un@@ to Mos@@ es , and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , un@@ to the camp at the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b , which are by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and lev@@ y a tri@@ bute un@@ to the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle : one sou@@ l of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the be@@ ev@@ es , and of the ass@@ es , and of the she@@ ep :
even of the children of Israel 's half , Mos@@ es took one portion of fif@@ ty , both of man and of be@@ ast , and gave them un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes , which kept the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the cap@@ tains of thousands , and of the cap@@ tains of hundreds , was six@@ teen thousand seven hundred and fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els .
now the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad had a very great multi@@ tude of c@@ attle : and when they saw the land of Jaz@@ er , and the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , that , be@@ hold , the place was a place for c@@ attle ;
for when they went up un@@ to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and saw the land , they dis@@ cour@@ aged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them .
and the Lord 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he made them w@@ ander in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years , until all the generation , that had done ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , was consu@@ med .
and Mos@@ es gave un@@ to them , even to the children of G@@ ad , and to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and un@@ to half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph , the k@@ ing@@ dom of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , the land , with the cities there@@ of in the co@@ asts , even the cities of the country round about .
and they depar@@ ted from Ra@@ mes@@ es in the first month , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the first month ; on the mor@@ row after the pass@@ over the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and Aaron the pri@@ est went up into mount H@@ or at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , and died there , in the for@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you ; then it shall come to pass , that those which ye let remain of them shall be pri@@ cks in your eyes , and thor@@ ns in your sides , and shall ve@@ x you in the land where@@ in ye d@@ well .
command the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; ( this is the land that shall fall un@@ to you for an inher@@ it@@ ance , even the land of Can@@ a@@ an with the co@@ asts there@@ of : )
and your border shall turn from the south to the as@@ cent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and pass on to Z@@ in : and the going forth there@@ of shall be from the south to K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea , and shall go on to Hazar @@@ -@@ @ add@@ ar , and pass on to Az@@ mon :
for the tri@@ be of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en according to the house of their fa@@ thers , and the tri@@ be of the children of G@@ ad according to the house of their fa@@ thers , have received their inher@@ it@@ ance ; and half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h have received their inher@@ it@@ ance :
and the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall deliver the S@@ lay@@ er out of the hand of the reven@@ ger of blood , and the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall restore him to the city of his ref@@ uge , w@@ hi@@ ther he was fled : and he shall abide in it un@@ to the death of the high pri@@ est , which was ano@@ in@@ ted with the hol@@ y oil .
and the chief fa@@ thers of the families of the children of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and sp@@ ake before Mos@@ es , and before the pr@@ inces , the chief fa@@ thers of the children of Israel :
and when the j@@ ub@@ ile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inher@@ it@@ ance be put un@@ to the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be where@@ un@@ to they are received : so shall their inher@@ it@@ ance be taken away from the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of our fa@@ thers .
and every daughter , that poss@@ ess@@ eth an inher@@ it@@ ance in any tri@@ be of the children of Israel , shall be wife un@@ to one of the family of the tri@@ be of her father , that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inher@@ it@@ ance of his fa@@ thers .
and it came to pass in the for@@ ti@@ eth year , in the ele@@ venth month , on the first day of the month , that Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , according un@@ to all that the Lord had given him in comman@@ d@@ ment un@@ to them ;
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down un@@ to us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God do@@ th give us .
moreover your little ones , which ye said should be a pre@@ y , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge between good and ev@@ il , they shall go in th@@ ither , and un@@ to them will I give it , and they shall poss@@ ess it .
and command th@@ ou the people , saying , Y@@ e are to pass through the coast of your bre@@ th@@ ren the children of E@@ sa@@ u , which d@@ well in Se@@ ir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves therefore :
Y@@ e shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
this day will I begin to put the dre@@ ad of the@@ e and the fear of the@@ e upon the nations that are under the whole heav@@ en , who shall hear report of the@@ e , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and be in an@@ gu@@ ish because of the@@ e .
from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the br@@ ink of the river of Ar@@ non , and from the city that is by the river , even un@@ to G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , there was not one city too strong for us : the Lord our God delivered all un@@ to us :
only take heed to th@@ y@@ self , and keep TH@@ Y sou@@ l dil@@ ig@@ ently , lest th@@ ou forget the things which th@@ ine eyes have seen , and lest they de@@ part from TH@@ Y heart all the days of TH@@ Y life : but te@@ ach them TH@@ Y sons , and TH@@ Y sons ' sons ;
take heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves , lest ye forget the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord your God , which he made with you , and make you a Gra@@ ven image , or the lik@@ eness of any thing , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h for@@ bid@@ den the@@ e .
and remember that th@@ ou w@@ ast a ser@@ vant in the land of Egypt , and that the Lord TH@@ Y God brought the@@ e out th@@ ence through a m@@ igh@@ ty hand and by a stret@@ ched out arm : therefore the Lord TH@@ Y God comman@@ ded the@@ e to keep the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day .
and it came to pass , when ye heard the voice out of the mid@@ st of the d@@ ark@@ ness , ( for the mountain did bur@@ n with fire , ) that ye came near un@@ to me , even all the heads of your tri@@ bes , and your el@@ ders ;
and ye said , be@@ hold , the Lord our God hat@@ h she@@ wed us his gl@@ ory and his gre@@ at@@ ness , and we have heard his voice out of the mid@@ st of the fire : we have seen this day that God do@@ th talk with man , and he li@@ vet@@ h .
and the Lord heard the voice of your words , when ye sp@@ ake un@@ to me ; and the Lord said un@@ to me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken un@@ to the@@ e : they have well said all that they have spoken .
that th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ test fear the Lord TH@@ Y God , to keep all his stat@@ utes and his comman@@ d@@ ments , which I command the@@ e , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y son , and TH@@ Y son 's son , all the days of TH@@ Y life ; and that TH@@ Y days may be prol@@ on@@ ged .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt te@@ ach them dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to TH@@ Y children , and s@@ halt talk of them when th@@ ou sit@@ test in th@@ ine house , and when th@@ ou walk@@ est by the way , and when th@@ ou li@@ est down , and when th@@ ou ris@@ est up .
( for the Lord TH@@ Y God is a Je@@ al@@ ous God among you ) lest the an@@ ger of the Lord TH@@ Y God be kin@@ d@@ led against the@@ e , and destroy the@@ e from off the face of the ear@@ th .
but because the Lord lov@@ ed you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn un@@ to your fa@@ thers , hat@@ h the Lord brought you out with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and re@@ deemed you out of the house of bon@@ d@@ men , from the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt .
remember , and forget not , how th@@ ou provok@@ ed@@ st the Lord TH@@ Y God to wr@@ ath in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : from the day that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st de@@ part out of the land of Egypt , until ye came un@@ to this place , ye have been rebel@@ li@@ ous against the Lord .
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which the Lord made with you , then I abo@@ de in the mount for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
and the Lord delivered un@@ to me two tables of stone written with the fin@@ ger of God ; and on them was written according to all the words , which the Lord sp@@ ake with you in the mount out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten comman@@ d@@ ments , which the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to you in the mount out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the Lord gave them un@@ to me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Be@@ ero@@ th of the children of Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ era : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ azar his son minist@@ ered in the pri@@ est 's office in his stead .
and know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of the Lord your God , his gre@@ at@@ ness , his m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and his stret@@ ched out arm ,
and what he did un@@ to the army of Egypt , un@@ to their hor@@ ses , and to their char@@ i@@ ots ; how he made the water of the Red sea to over@@ flow them as they pursu@@ ed after you , and how the Lord hat@@ h destroyed them un@@ to this day ;
for the land , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est in to poss@@ ess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from wh@@ ence ye came out , where th@@ ou so@@ w@@ ed@@ st TH@@ Y se@@ ed , and water@@ ed@@ st it with TH@@ Y fo@@ ot , as a gar@@ den of her@@ bs :
and then the Lord 's wr@@ ath be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he shut up the heav@@ en , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye per@@ ish quickly from off the good land which the Lord gi@@ vet@@ h you .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you upon all the land that ye shall tre@@ ad upon , as he hat@@ h said un@@ to you .
and a cur@@ se , if ye will not obe@@ y the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other go@@ ds , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h brought the@@ e in un@@ to the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it , that th@@ ou s@@ halt put the b@@ les@@ sing upon mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and the cur@@ se upon mount E@@ bal .
then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to d@@ well there ; th@@ ither shall ye bring all that I command you ; your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , your ti@@ th@@ es , and the he@@ ave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which ye vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord :
T@@ ho@@ u may@@ est not eat within TH@@ Y gates the ti@@ the of TH@@ Y cor@@ n , or of TH@@ Y wine , or of TH@@ Y oil , or the fir@@ st@@ lings of TH@@ Y her@@ ds or of TH@@ Y flock , nor any of TH@@ Y vows which th@@ ou vo@@ west , nor TH@@ Y fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , or he@@ ave offering of th@@ ine hand :
if the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h chosen to put his name there be too far from the@@ e , then th@@ ou s@@ halt kill of TH@@ Y her@@ d and of TH@@ Y flock , which the Lord hat@@ h given the@@ e , as I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat in TH@@ Y gates wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever TH@@ Y sou@@ l lus@@ te@@ th after .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , the f@@ les@@ h and the blood , upon the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God : and the blood of TH@@ Y sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es shall be p@@ oured out upon the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the f@@ les@@ h .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not do so un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God : for every ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord , which he ha@@ te@@ th , have they done un@@ to their go@@ ds ; for even their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters they have bur@@ n@@ t in the fire to their go@@ ds .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not he@@ arken un@@ to the words of that pro@@ phe@@ t , or that dre@@ amer of dre@@ ams : for the Lord your God pro@@ vet@@ h you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hat@@ h sought to th@@ rust the@@ e away from the Lord TH@@ Y God , which brought the@@ e out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
if there be among you a poor man of one of TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren within any of TH@@ Y gates in TH@@ Y land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt not har@@ den th@@ ine heart , nor shut th@@ ine hand from TH@@ Y poor brother :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely give him , and th@@ ine heart shall not be gri@@ ev@@ ed when th@@ ou gi@@ v@@ est un@@ to him : because that for this thing the Lord TH@@ Y God shall b@@ less the@@ e in all TH@@ Y works , and in all that th@@ ou p@@ ut@@ test th@@ ine hand un@@ to .
and there shall be no le@@ av@@ ened bread seen with the@@ e in all TH@@ Y coast seven days ; neither shall there anything of the f@@ les@@ h , which th@@ ou sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed@@ st the first day at even , remain all night until the morning .
but at the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose to place his name in , there th@@ ou s@@ halt sacrifice the pass@@ over at even , at the going down of the sun , at the season that th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st forth out of Egypt .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt keep the feast of weeks un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God with a tri@@ bute of a fre@@ e@@ will offering of th@@ ine hand , which th@@ ou s@@ halt give un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , according as the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ jo@@ ice in TH@@ Y feast , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y son , and TH@@ Y daughter , and TH@@ Y man@@ ser@@ vant , and TH@@ Y ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , and the Lev@@ ite , the st@@ ran@@ ger , and the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the wi@@ dow , that are within TH@@ Y gates .
seven days s@@ halt th@@ ou keep a so@@ lem@@ n feast un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God in the place which the Lord shall choose : because the Lord TH@@ Y God shall b@@ less the@@ e in all th@@ ine increase , and in all the works of th@@ ine hands , therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely re@@ jo@@ ice .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou bring forth that man or that woman , which have committed that w@@ ic@@ ked thing , un@@ to TH@@ Y gates , even that man or that woman , and s@@ halt stone them with stones , ti@@ ll they die .
if there arise a matter too hard for the@@ e in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stro@@ ke and stro@@ ke , being matters of controversy within TH@@ Y gates : then s@@ halt th@@ ou arise , and get the@@ e up into the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose ;
and th@@ ou s@@ halt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall she@@ w the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt observe to do according to all that they inform the@@ e :
according to the sentence of the law which they shall te@@ ach the@@ e , and according to the judgment which they shall tell the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt do : th@@ ou s@@ halt not decline from the sentence which they shall she@@ w the@@ e , to the right hand , nor to the left .
and the man that will do pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , and will not he@@ arken un@@ to the pri@@ est that stan@@ de@@ th to minister there before the Lord TH@@ Y God , or un@@ to the judge , even that man shall die : and th@@ ou s@@ halt put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt in any wise set him king over the@@ e , whom the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose : one from among TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren s@@ halt th@@ ou set king over the@@ e : th@@ ou may@@ est not set a st@@ ran@@ ger over the@@ e , which is not TH@@ Y brother .
that his heart be not lifted up above his bre@@ th@@ ren , and that he turn not aside from the comman@@ d@@ ment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prol@@ ong his days in his k@@ ing@@ dom , he , and his children , in the mid@@ st of Israel .
and this shall be the pri@@ est 's due from the people , from them that offer a sacrifice , whether it be o@@ x or she@@ ep ; and they shall give un@@ to the pri@@ est the sho@@ ul@@ der , and the two che@@ eks , and the ma@@ w .
according to all that th@@ ou desi@@ red@@ st of the Lord TH@@ Y God in Ho@@ re@@ b in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will not he@@ arken un@@ to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the pro@@ phe@@ t , which shall pres@@ ume to speak a word in my name , which I have not comman@@ ded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other go@@ ds , even that pro@@ phe@@ t shall die .
when th@@ ou go@@ est out to battle against th@@ ine enem@@ ies , and se@@ est hor@@ ses , and char@@ i@@ ots , and a people more than th@@ ou , be not afraid of them : for the Lord TH@@ Y God is with the@@ e , which brought the@@ e up out of the land of Egypt .
and what man is he that hat@@ h plan@@ ted a v@@ ine@@ yard , and hat@@ h not yet e@@ aten of it ? let him also go and return un@@ to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking un@@ to the people , that they shall make cap@@ tains of the armies to lead the people .
and it shall be , if it make the@@ e answer of peace , and open un@@ to the@@ e , then it shall be , that all the people that is found there@@ in shall be tri@@ but@@ aries un@@ to the@@ e , and they shall serve the@@ e .
but the women , and the little ones , and the c@@ attle , and all that is in the city , even all the sp@@ oil there@@ of , s@@ halt th@@ ou take un@@ to th@@ y@@ self ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the sp@@ oil of th@@ ine enem@@ ies , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given the@@ e .
and it shall be , that the city which is next un@@ to the sla@@ in man , even the el@@ ders of that city shall take an he@@ if@@ er , which hat@@ h not been w@@ rought with , and which hat@@ h not drawn in the yok@@ e ;
and it shall be , if th@@ ou have no de@@ light in her , then th@@ ou s@@ halt let her go w@@ hi@@ ther she will ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not sell her at all for money , th@@ ou s@@ halt not make mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of her , because th@@ ou h@@ ast hum@@ b@@ led her .
then it shall be , when he mak@@ eth his sons to inher@@ it that which he hat@@ h , that he may not make the son of the bel@@ ov@@ ed fir@@ st@@ born before the son of the ha@@ ted , which is indeed the fir@@ st@@ born :
in like manner s@@ halt th@@ ou do with his ass ; and so s@@ halt th@@ ou do with his ra@@ im@@ ent ; and with all lost thing of TH@@ Y brother 's , which he hat@@ h lost , and th@@ ou h@@ ast found , s@@ halt th@@ ou do likewise : th@@ ou may@@ est not hide th@@ y@@ self .
if a bird 's n@@ est chance to be before the@@ e in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eg@@ gs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eg@@ gs , th@@ ou s@@ halt not take the dam with the young :
and they shall am@@ erce him in an hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and give them un@@ to the father of the dam@@ sel , because he hat@@ h brought up an ev@@ il name upon a vir@@ gin of Israel : and she shall be his wife ; he may not put her away all his days .
if there be among you any man , that is not clean by reason of un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess that chan@@ c@@ eth him by night , then shall he go abroad out of the camp , he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening co@@ me@@ th on , he shall was@@ h himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
that which is gone out of TH@@ Y li@@ ps th@@ ou s@@ halt keep and perform ; even a fre@@ e@@ will offering , according as th@@ ou h@@ ast vowed un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou h@@ ast promised with TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st into the standing cor@@ n of TH@@ Y neighbour , then th@@ ou may@@ est p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars with th@@ ine hand ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not move a si@@ ck@@ le un@@ to TH@@ Y neighbour 's standing cor@@ n .
when a man hat@@ h taken a wife , and married her , and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes , because he hat@@ h found some un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess in her : then let him write her a bill of div@@ or@@ cement , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
and if the latter husband h@@ ate her , and write her a bill of div@@ or@@ cement , and gi@@ vet@@ h it in her hand , and sen@@ de@@ th her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , which sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is def@@ iled ; for that is ab@@ omin@@ ation before the Lord : and th@@ ou s@@ halt not cause the land to sin , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
when a man hat@@ h taken a new wife , he shall not go out to war , neither shall he be charged with any business : but he shall be free at home one year , and shall che@@ er up his wife which he hat@@ h taken .
at his day th@@ ou s@@ halt give him his h@@ ire , neither shall the sun go down upon it ; for he is poor , and set@@ te@@ th his heart upon it : lest he cry against the@@ e un@@ to the Lord , and it be sin un@@ to the@@ e .
and it shall be , if the w@@ ic@@ ked man be wor@@ thy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
for@@ ty stri@@ pes he may give him , and not exceed : lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stri@@ pes , then TH@@ Y brother should seem v@@ ile un@@ to the@@ e .
that th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the first of all the fruit of the ear@@ th , which th@@ ou s@@ halt bring of TH@@ Y land that the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , and s@@ halt put it in a bas@@ ket , and s@@ halt go un@@ to the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose to place his name there .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt go un@@ to the pri@@ est that shall be in those days , and say un@@ to him , I prof@@ ess this day un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , that I am come un@@ to the country which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to our fa@@ thers for to give us .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan un@@ to the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , that th@@ ou s@@ halt set the@@ e up great stones , and pla@@ ister them with pla@@ ister :
therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in mount E@@ bal , and th@@ ou s@@ halt pla@@ ister them with pla@@ ister .
and it shall come to pass , if th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ arken dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to observe and to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments which I command the@@ e this day , that the Lord TH@@ Y God will set the@@ e on high above all nations of the ear@@ th :
but it shall come to pass , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not he@@ arken un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to observe to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which I command the@@ e this day ; that all these cur@@ ses shall come upon the@@ e , and over@@ take the@@ e :
the Lord shall sm@@ ite the@@ e with a consumption , and with a f@@ ever , and with an inf@@ lam@@ mation , and with an extreme burning , and with the s@@ word , and with b@@ lasting , and with mil@@ dew ; and they shall pursue the@@ e until th@@ ou per@@ ish .
Th@@ ine o@@ x shall be sla@@ in before th@@ ine eyes , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not eat there@@ of : th@@ ine ass shall be viol@@ ently taken away from before TH@@ Y face , and shall not be restored to the@@ e : TH@@ Y she@@ ep shall be given un@@ to th@@ ine enem@@ ies , and th@@ ou s@@ halt have none to rescue them .
the Lord shall sm@@ ite the@@ e in the k@@ ne@@ es , and in the leg@@ s , with a sor@@ e bot@@ ch that can@@ not be he@@ aled , from the sole of TH@@ Y fo@@ ot un@@ to the top of TH@@ Y head .
and he shall bes@@ i@@ ege the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates , until TH@@ Y high and f@@ enced walls come down , where@@ in th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ ted@@ st , throughout all TH@@ Y land : and he shall bes@@ i@@ ege the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates throughout all TH@@ Y land , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the fruit of th@@ ine own body , the f@@ les@@ h of TH@@ Y sons and of TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given the@@ e , in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall dist@@ ress the@@ e :
so that the man that is tender among you , and very de@@ licate , his eye shall be ev@@ il toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the re@@ mn@@ ant of his children which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of them of the f@@ les@@ h of his children whom he shall eat : because he hat@@ h nothing left him in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall dist@@ ress the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates .
and it shall come to pass , that as the Lord re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed over you to do you good , and to multi@@ ply you ; so the Lord will re@@ jo@@ ice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to n@@ ought ; and ye shall be p@@ lu@@ cked from off the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it .
in the morning th@@ ou s@@ halt say , Wo@@ uld God it were even ! and at even th@@ ou s@@ halt say , Wo@@ uld God it were morning ! for the fear of th@@ ine heart where@@ with th@@ ou s@@ halt fear , and for the sight of th@@ ine eyes which th@@ ou s@@ halt see .
that he may establish the@@ e to day for a people un@@ to himself , and that he may be un@@ to the@@ e a God , as he hat@@ h said un@@ to the@@ e , and as he hat@@ h sworn un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b .
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you , and the st@@ ran@@ ger that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagu@@ es of that land , and the si@@ ck@@ nesses which the Lord hat@@ h laid upon it ;
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon the@@ e , the b@@ les@@ sing and the cur@@ se , which I have set before the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt call them to mind among all the nations , w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h driven the@@ e ,
if th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ arken un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which are written in this book of the law , and if th@@ ou turn un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to their fa@@ thers , that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey ; and they shall have e@@ aten and filled themselves , and wa@@ x@@ en f@@ at ; then will they turn un@@ to other go@@ ds , and serve them , and prov@@ oke me , and break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
they have moved me to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with that which is not God ; they have provoked me to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities : and I will move them to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with those which are not a people ; I will prov@@ oke them to an@@ ger with a fo@@ ol@@ ish nation .
get the@@ e up into this mountain A@@ bar@@ im , un@@ to mount N@@ eb@@ o , which is in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and be@@ hold the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give un@@ to the children of Israel for a possession :
and for the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of the ear@@ th and ful@@ ness there@@ of , and for the good will of him that d@@ wel@@ t in the b@@ ush : let the b@@ les@@ sing come upon the head of Joseph , and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his bre@@ th@@ ren .
from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and this Lebanon even un@@ to the great river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and un@@ to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
this book of the law shall not de@@ part out of TH@@ Y m@@ outh ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt medi@@ t@@ ate there@@ in day and night , that th@@ ou may@@ est observe to do according to all that is written there@@ in : for then th@@ ou s@@ halt make TH@@ Y way prosperous , and then th@@ ou s@@ halt have good success .
and it came to pass about the time of sh@@ utting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : w@@ hi@@ ther the men went I wo@@ t not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall over@@ take them .
be@@ hold , when we come into the land , th@@ ou s@@ halt bin@@ d this line of scar@@ let thre@@ ad in the window which th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st let us down by : and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring TH@@ Y father , and TH@@ Y mother , and TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , and all TH@@ Y father 's household , home un@@ to the@@ e .
and Jos@@ hua said , Her@@ e@@ by ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the Gir@@ gas@@ hi@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites .
and as they that b@@ are the Ar@@ k were come un@@ to Jordan , and the feet of the pri@@ ests that b@@ are the Ar@@ k were di@@ pped in the bri@@ m of the water , ( for Jordan over@@ flow@@ eth all his banks all the time of har@@ v@@ est , )
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over , that the Ar@@ k of the Lord passed over , and the pri@@ ests , in the presence of the people .
and it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests that b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord were come up out of the mid@@ st of Jordan , and the so@@ les of the pri@@ ests ' feet were lifted up un@@ to the d@@ ry land , that the waters of Jordan returned un@@ to their place , and flow@@ ed over all his banks , as they did before .
for the Lord your God dri@@ ed up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the Lord your God did to the Red sea , which he dri@@ ed up from before us , until we were gone over :
and this is the cause why Jos@@ hua did circum@@ c@@ ise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were mal@@ es , even all the men of war , died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
and the man@@ na ce@@ ased on the mor@@ row after they had e@@ aten of the old cor@@ n of the land ; neither had the children of Israel man@@ na any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Can@@ a@@ an that year .
and it came to pass , when Jos@@ hua had spoken un@@ to the people , that the seven pri@@ ests bearing the seven tr@@ ump@@ ets of r@@ ams ' hor@@ ns passed on before the Lord , and ble@@ w with the tr@@ ump@@ ets : and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord followed them .
and the city shall be accur@@ sed , even it , and all that are there@@ in , to the Lord : only Ra@@ ha@@ b the har@@ lot shall live , she and all that are with her in the house , because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers that we sent .
and the young men that were sp@@ ies went in , and brought Ra@@ ha@@ b , and her father , and her mother , and her bre@@ th@@ ren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kin@@ d@@ red , and left them without the camp of Israel .
and they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire , and all that was there@@ in : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of br@@ ass and of iron , they put into the treas@@ ury of the house of the Lord .
but the children of Israel committed a t@@ res@@ pass in the accur@@ sed thing : for A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , took of the accur@@ sed thing : and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against the children of Israel .
and I , and all the people that are with me , will approach un@@ to the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
( for they will come out after us ) ti@@ ll we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord shall ye do . see , I have comman@@ ded you .
and all the people , even the people of war that were with him , went up , and drew n@@ igh , and came before the city , and pit@@ ched on the north side of A@@ I : now there was a val@@ ley between them and A@@ I .
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , Jos@@ hua went that night into the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley .
and the amb@@ ush ar@@ ose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stret@@ ched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and has@@ ted and set the city on fire .
and the other issued out of the city against them ; so they were in the mid@@ st of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side : and they smo@@ te them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
and it came to pass , when Israel had made an end of s@@ lay@@ ing all the inhabitants of A@@ I in the field , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness where@@ in they ch@@ ased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the s@@ word , until they were consu@@ med , that all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes returned un@@ to A@@ I , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word .
therefore the five kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , the king of Eg@@ lon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their hosts , and en@@ camp@@ ed before Gi@@ be@@ on , and made war against it .
and it came to pass , when Jos@@ hua and the children of Israel had made an end of s@@ lay@@ ing them with a very great sla@@ ughter , ti@@ ll they were consu@@ med , that the rest which remained of them entered into f@@ enced cities .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings un@@ to him out of the cave , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and the king of Eg@@ lon .
and that day Jos@@ hua took Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and the king there@@ of he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , them , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in ; he let none remain : and he did to the king of Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah as he did un@@ to the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and the Lord delivered L@@ ach@@ ish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in , according to all that he had done to Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and they took it , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and the king there@@ of , and all the cities there@@ of , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in ; he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eg@@ lon ; but destroyed it ut@@ ter@@ ly , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in .
and it came to pass , when J@@ ab@@ in king of Haz@@ or had heard those things , that he sent to J@@ ob@@ a@@ b king of Mad@@ on , and to the king of Sh@@ im@@ ron , and to the king of A@@ ch@@ shap@@ h ,
and all the cities of those kings , and all the kings of them , did Jos@@ hua take , and smo@@ te them with the edge of the s@@ word , and he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them , as Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord comman@@ ded .
and all the sp@@ oil of these cities , and the c@@ attle , the children of Israel took for a pre@@ y un@@ to themselves ; but every man they smo@@ te with the edge of the s@@ word , until they had destroyed them , neither left they any to bre@@ a@@ the .
for it was of the Lord to har@@ den their hear@@ ts , that they should come against Israel in battle , that he might destroy them ut@@ ter@@ ly , and that they might have no favour , but that he might destroy them , as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smo@@ te , and poss@@ essed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river Ar@@ non un@@ to mount Her@@ mon , and all the pla@@ in on the east :
and their coast was from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the bank of the river Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the mid@@ st of the river , and all the pla@@ in by M@@ ede@@ ba ;
and these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and the heads of the fa@@ thers of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel , distributed for inher@@ it@@ ance to them .
and now , be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h kept me alive , as he said , these for@@ ty and five years , even since the Lord sp@@ ake this word un@@ to Mos@@ es , while the children of Israel w@@ and@@ ered in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : and now , lo , I am this day fo@@ ur@@ score and five years old .
as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Mos@@ es sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
and it went out to the south side to Ma@@ al@@ e@@ h @@@ -@@ @ ac@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and passed along to Z@@ in , and as@@ cen@@ ded up on the south side un@@ to K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea , and passed along to H@@ ez@@ ron , and went up to Ad@@ ar , and f@@ et@@ ched a comp@@ ass to Kar@@ ka@@ a :
from th@@ ence it passed toward Az@@ mon , and went out un@@ to the river of Egypt ; and the go@@ ings out of that coast were at the sea : this shall be your south coast .
and the border went up to Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ la , and passed along by the north of Beth @@@ -@@ @ arab@@ ah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en :
and the border went up toward De@@ bir from the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or , and so nor@@ th@@ ward , looking toward G@@ ilg@@ al , that is before the going up to Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , which is on the south side of the river : and the border passed toward the waters of En @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at En @@@ -@@ @ ro@@ gel :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill un@@ to the fo@@ un@@ tain of the water of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border was drawn to Ba@@ al@@ ah , which is Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im :
and the border comp@@ ass@@ ed from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to mount Se@@ ir , and passed along un@@ to the side of mount J@@ ear@@ im , which is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on , on the north side , and went down to Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and passed on to Tim@@ n@@ ah :
and the border went out un@@ to the side of E@@ kr@@ on nor@@ th@@ ward : and the border was drawn to Sh@@ ic@@ ron , and passed along to mount Ba@@ al@@ ah , and went out un@@ to J@@ ab@@ ne@@ el ; and the go@@ ings out of the border were at the sea .
there was also a lot for the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; for he was the fir@@ st@@ born of Joseph ; to w@@ it , for Mac@@ hir the fir@@ st@@ born of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the father of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad : because he was a man of war , therefore he had G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and B@@ ash@@ an .
there was also a lot for the rest of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h by their families ; for the children of A@@ bi@@ ez@@ er , and for the children of H@@ ele@@ k , and for the children of As@@ ri@@ el , and for the children of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and for the children of Hep@@ her , and for the children of Sh@@ em@@ ida : these were the male children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph by their families .
and the coast des@@ cen@@ ded un@@ to the river Kan@@ ah , sou@@ th@@ ward of the river : these cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im are among the cities of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h : the coast of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h also was on the north side of the river , and the out@@ go@@ ings of it were at the sea :
and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had in Is@@ sac@@ har and in As@@ her Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean and her towns , and I@@ ble@@ am and her towns , and the inhabitants of D@@ or and her towns , and the inhabitants of En@@ dor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Ta@@ an@@ ach and her towns , and the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and her towns , even three countries .
give out from among you three men for each tri@@ be : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inher@@ it@@ ance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and their border on the north side was from Jordan ; and the border went up to the side of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the north side , and went up through the mountains w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard ; and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Beth @@@ -@@ @ av@@ en .
and the border went over from th@@ ence toward L@@ uz , to the side of L@@ uz , which is Be@@ the@@ l , sou@@ th@@ ward ; and the border des@@ cen@@ ded to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ ad@@ ar , near the hill that li@@ eth on the south side of the ne@@ ther Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on .
and the border was drawn th@@ ence , and comp@@ ass@@ ed the cor@@ ner of the sea sou@@ th@@ ward , from the hill that li@@ eth before Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on sou@@ th@@ ward ; and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ al , which is Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , a city of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h : this was the west quarter .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and went forth toward Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the going up of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , and des@@ cen@@ ded to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en ,
out of the portion of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Simeon : for the part of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was too much for them : therefore the children of Simeon had their inher@@ it@@ ance within the inher@@ it@@ ance of them .
and tur@@ net@@ h toward the sun@@ rising to Beth @@@ -@@ @ da@@ g@@ on , and reac@@ het@@ h to Ze@@ bul@@ un , and to the val@@ ley of J@@ ip@@ h@@ th@@ ah @@@ -@@ @ el toward the north side of Beth @@@ -@@ @ E@@ mek , and Ne@@ i@@ el , and go@@ eth out to Cab@@ ul on the left hand ,
and the lot came out for the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : and the children of Aaron the pri@@ est , which were of the L@@ evi@@ tes , had by lot out of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of Simeon , and out of the tri@@ be of Benjamin , thir@@ teen cities .
and the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h had by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and out of the tri@@ be of Dan , and out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , ten cities .
and the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on had by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tri@@ be of As@@ her , and out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in B@@ ash@@ an , thir@@ teen cities .
and they gave out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
and un@@ to the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the other half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h they gave G@@ olan in B@@ ash@@ an with her subur@@ bs , to be a city of ref@@ uge for the S@@ lay@@ er ; and Be@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ ter@@ ah with her subur@@ bs ; two cities .
now to the one half of the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h Mos@@ es had given possession in B@@ ash@@ an : but un@@ to the other half there@@ of gave Jos@@ hua among their bre@@ th@@ ren on this side Jordan w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard . and when Jos@@ hua sent them away also un@@ to their ten@@ ts , then he b@@ les@@ sed them ,
and when they came un@@ to the borders of Jordan , that are in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h built there an alt@@ ar by Jordan , a great alt@@ ar to see to .
and the children of Israel heard say , be@@ hold , the chi@@ d@@ ren of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h have built an alt@@ ar over against the land of Can@@ a@@ an , in the borders of Jordan , at the passage of the children of Israel .
and when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , to go up to war against them .
and the children of Israel sent un@@ to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est ,
and they came un@@ to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , un@@ to the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and they sp@@ ake with them , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord , What t@@ res@@ pass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that ye have buil@@ ded you an alt@@ ar , that ye might rebel this day against the Lord ?
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak un@@ to our children , saying , What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
and when Ph@@ ine@@ has the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sp@@ ake , it pleased them .
and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces , returned from the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and from the children of G@@ ad , out of the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , un@@ to the land of Can@@ a@@ an , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
and I brought you into the land of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which d@@ wel@@ t on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might poss@@ ess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
and ye went over Jordan , and came un@@ to Jer@@ ich@@ o : and the men of Jer@@ ich@@ o fought against you , the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Gir@@ gas@@ hi@@ tes , the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
and the children of the Ken@@ ite , Mos@@ es ' father in law , went up out of the city of pal@@ m trees with the children of Ju@@ da@@ h into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ju@@ da@@ h , which li@@ eth in the south of Ara@@ d ; and they went and d@@ wel@@ t among the people .
neither did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h drive out the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean and her towns , nor Ta@@ an@@ ach and her towns , nor the inhabitants of D@@ or and her towns , nor the inhabitants of I@@ ble@@ am and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and her towns : but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites would d@@ well in that land .
neither did Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i drive out the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , nor the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ an@@ ath ; but he d@@ wel@@ t among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h and of Beth @@@ -@@ @ an@@ ath became tri@@ but@@ aries un@@ to them .
and an an@@ gel of the Lord came up from G@@ ilg@@ al to Bo@@ c@@ him , and said , I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you un@@ to the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to your fa@@ thers ; and I said , I will never break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you .
and it came to pass , when the an@@ gel of the Lord sp@@ ake these words un@@ to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
and they for@@ so@@ ok the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other go@@ ds , of the go@@ ds of the people that were round about them , and bo@@ wed themselves un@@ to them , and provoked the Lord to an@@ ger .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of sp@@ o@@ ilers that sp@@ o@@ iled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enem@@ ies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enem@@ ies .
and yet they would not he@@ arken un@@ to their judges , but they went a wh@@ oring after other go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed themselves un@@ to them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fa@@ thers walked in , obe@@ ying the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord ; but they did not so .
but when the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , the Lord raised them up a deliver@@ er , E@@ h@@ ud the son of Ger@@ a , a Benj@@ am@@ ite , a man le@@ f@@ than@@ ded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present un@@ to Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b .
and they tar@@ ried ti@@ ll they were as@@ ha@@ med : and , be@@ hold , he opened not the doors of the par@@ l@@ our ; therefore they took a key , and opened them : and , be@@ hold , their lor@@ d was fallen down dead on the ear@@ th .
and , be@@ hold , as B@@ arak pursu@@ ed Sis@@ era , Ja@@ el came out to meet him , and said un@@ to him , C@@ ome , and I will she@@ w the@@ e the man whom th@@ ou seek@@ est . and when he came into her tent , be@@ hold , Sis@@ era lay dead , and the na@@ il was in his temp@@ les .
they that are delivered from the no@@ ise of ar@@ chers in the places of drawing water , there shall they re@@ hear@@ se the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of the Lord , even the righ@@ te@@ ous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel : then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates .
and so it was , when Israel had so@@ wn , that the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites came up , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
then G@@ ide@@ on took ten men of his servants , and did as the Lord had said un@@ to him : and so it was , because he fear@@ ed his father 's household , and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
and when the men of the city ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , the alt@@ ar of Ba@@ al was cast down , and the gro@@ ve was cut down that was by it , and the second bul@@ lock was offered upon the alt@@ ar that was built .
be@@ hold , I will put a F@@ le@@ ece of wo@@ ol in the floor ; and if the dew be on the F@@ le@@ ece only , and it be d@@ ry upon all the ear@@ th bes@@ ide , then shall I know that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t save Israel by mine hand , as th@@ ou h@@ ast said .
then Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , who is G@@ ide@@ on , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pit@@ ched bes@@ ide the well of Har@@ od : so that the host of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites were on the north side of them , by the hill of Mo@@ re@@ h , in the val@@ ley .
and it was so , when G@@ ide@@ on heard the telling of the dream , and the interpre@@ tation there@@ of , that he wor@@ shi@@ pped , and returned into the host of Israel , and said , arise ; for the Lord hat@@ h delivered into your hand the host of Mi@@ dian .
and the three hundred ble@@ w the tr@@ ump@@ ets , and the Lord set every man 's s@@ word against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ it@@ ta@@ h in Zer@@ er@@ ath , and to the border of A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ ho@@ lah , un@@ to T@@ ab@@ b@@ ath .
now Z@@ eb@@ ah and Zal@@ mun@@ na were in Kar@@ kor , and their hosts with them , about fif@@ teen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew s@@ word .
and ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have sla@@ in his sons , thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , the son of his ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , king over the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , because he is your brother ; )
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , th@@ ou s@@ halt rise early , and set upon the city : and , be@@ hold , when he and the people that is with him come out against the@@ e , then may@@ est th@@ ou do to them as th@@ ou s@@ halt find occasion .
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , be@@ hold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smo@@ te them .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and sle@@ w them .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his b@@ ough , and followed A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the to@@ wer of Sh@@ ec@@ hem died also , about a thousand men and women .
but there was a strong to@@ wer within the city , and th@@ ither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and g@@ at them up to the top of the to@@ wer .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il again in the sight of the Lord , and served Ba@@ al@@ im , and Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and the go@@ ds of Syria , and the go@@ ds of Z@@ id@@ on , and the go@@ ds of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the go@@ ds of the children of Am@@ mon , and the go@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and for@@ so@@ ok the Lord , and served not him .
while Israel d@@ wel@@ t in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon and her towns , and in A@@ ro@@ er and her towns , and in all the cities that be along by the co@@ asts of Ar@@ non , three hundred years ? why therefore did ye not rec@@ over them within that time ?
then it shall be , that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever co@@ me@@ th forth of the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Am@@ mon , shall su@@ rely be the Lord 's , and I will offer it up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering .
and when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Am@@ mon , and the Lord delivered them into my hand : where@@ fore then are ye come up un@@ to me this day , to fight against me ?
for it came to pass , when the fla@@ me went up toward heav@@ en from off the alt@@ ar , that the an@@ gel of the Lord as@@ cen@@ ded in the fla@@ me of the alt@@ ar . and Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
and when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing cor@@ n of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and bur@@ n@@ t up both the shocks , and also the standing cor@@ n , with the v@@ ine@@ yards and ol@@ ives .
and it came to pass , when their hear@@ ts were mer@@ ry , that they said , C@@ all for Sam@@ son , that he may make us sport . and they called for Sam@@ son out of the prison house ; and he made them sport : and they set him between the pil@@ lars .
and Sam@@ son took hold of the two middle pil@@ lars upon which the house stood , and on which it was bor@@ ne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tri@@ be of the Dani@@ tes sought them an inher@@ it@@ ance to d@@ well in ; for un@@ to that day all their inher@@ it@@ ance had not fallen un@@ to them among the tri@@ bes of Israel .
and they took the things which Mic@@ ah had made , and the pri@@ est which he had , and came un@@ to La@@ ish , un@@ to a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smo@@ te them with the edge of the s@@ word , and bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire .
and the children of Dan set up the Gra@@ ven image : and Jon@@ athan , the son of Ger@@ sho@@ m , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , he and his sons were pri@@ ests to the tri@@ be of Dan until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
and it came to pass on the fourth day , when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , that he rose up to de@@ part : and the dam@@ sel 's father said un@@ to his son in law , Com@@ for@@ t th@@ ine heart with a mor@@ sel of bread , and after@@ ward go your way .
and they sat down , and did eat and drink both of them together : for the dam@@ sel 's father had said un@@ to the man , Be content , I pra@@ y the@@ e , and tar@@ ry all night , and let th@@ ine heart be mer@@ ry .
and when they were by Je@@ bus , the day was far spent ; and the ser@@ vant said un@@ to his master , C@@ ome , I pra@@ y the@@ e , and let us turn in into this city of the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and lo@@ dge in it .
and they turned aside th@@ ither , to go in and to lo@@ dge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lo@@ d@@ ging .
and her lor@@ d rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way : and , be@@ hold , the woman his conc@@ ub@@ ine was fallen down at the door of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
and when he was come into his house , he took a k@@ ni@@ fe , and laid hold on his conc@@ ub@@ ine , and divided her , together with her b@@ ones , into twelve pieces , and sent her into all the co@@ asts of Israel .
now therefore deliver us the men , the children of Bel@@ ial , which are in Gi@@ be@@ ah , that we may put them to death , and put away ev@@ il from Israel . but the children of Benjamin would not he@@ arken to the voice of their bre@@ th@@ ren the children of Israel :
and the children of Israel ar@@ ose , and went up to the house of God , and asked coun@@ sel of God , and said , Wh@@ ich of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin ? and the Lord said , Ju@@ da@@ h shall go up first .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel un@@ to the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; but the battle over@@ took them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the mid@@ st of them .
and the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin , and smo@@ te them with the edge of the s@@ word , as well the men of every city , as the be@@ ast , and all that came to hand : also they set on fire all the cities that they came to .
and they found among the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ g@@ ins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them un@@ to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wi@@ ves , according to their number , of them that dan@@ ced , whom they caught : and they went and returned un@@ to their inher@@ it@@ ance , and rep@@ aired the cities , and d@@ wel@@ t in them .
then she ar@@ ose with her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in law , that she might return from the country of Mo@@ a@@ b : for she had heard in the country of Mo@@ a@@ b how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return un@@ to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
turn again , my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , go your way ; for I am too old to have an husband . if I should say , I have hope , if I should have an husband also to night , and should also bear sons ;
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had g@@ le@@ an@@ ed : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was su@@ ffic@@ ed .
and when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ loc@@ ks , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of fl@@ our , and a bot@@ tle of wine , and brought him un@@ to the house of the Lord in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h : and the child was young .
and I will raise me up a fa@@ ith@@ ful pri@@ est , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine ano@@ in@@ ted for ever .
and it was so , that , after they had carried it about , the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction : and he smo@@ te the men of the city , both small and great , and they had emer@@ ods in their secret parts .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore ye shall make images of your emer@@ ods , and images of your m@@ ice that mar the land ; and ye shall give gl@@ ory un@@ to the God of Israel : per@@ ad@@ venture he will ligh@@ ten his hand from off you , and from off your go@@ ds , and from off your land .
and the k@@ ine took the stra@@ ight way to the way of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and went along the highway , low@@ ing as they went , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went after them un@@ to the border of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes took down the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and the co@@ ffer that was with it , where@@ in the je@@ wel@@ s of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es the same day un@@ to the Lord .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even un@@ to this day , where@@ with they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and served other go@@ ds , so do they also un@@ to the@@ e .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his char@@ i@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ se@@ men ; and some shall run before his char@@ i@@ ots .
and he had a son , whose name was Sa@@ ul , a choice young man , and a good@@ ly : and there was not among the children of Israel a good@@ lier person than he : from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward he was higher than any of the people .
and as for th@@ ine ass@@ es that were lost three days ago , set not TH@@ Y mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on the@@ e , and on all TH@@ Y father 's house ?
and they ar@@ ose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Sa@@ ul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send the@@ e away . and Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
and when they for@@ g@@ at the Lord their God , he sold them into the hand of Sis@@ era , captain of the host of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and they fought against them .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a stra@@ it , ( for the people were dist@@ ressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in c@@ aves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in ro@@ cks , and in high places , and in p@@ its .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering , be@@ hold , Samuel came ; and Sa@@ ul went out to meet him , that he might sal@@ ute him .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither s@@ word nor spe@@ ar found in the hand of any of the people that were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan : but with Sa@@ ul and with Jon@@ athan his son was there found .
now it came to pass upon a day , that Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul said un@@ to the young man that b@@ are his arm@@ our , C@@ ome , and let us go over to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , that is on the other side . but he told not his father .
and between the passa@@ ges , by which Jon@@ athan sought to go over un@@ to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side : and the name of the one was Boz@@ ez , and the name of the other Sen@@ e@@ h .
and Sa@@ ul and all the people that were with him assemb@@ led themselves , and they came to the battle : and , be@@ hold , every man 's s@@ word was against his fellow , and there was a very great dis@@ com@@ f@@ it@@ ure .
moreover the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws that were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Isra@@ eli@@ tes that were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan .
but Jon@@ athan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath : where@@ fore he put forth the end of the ro@@ d that was in his hand , and di@@ pped it in an hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b , and put his hand to his m@@ outh ; and his eyes were en@@ ligh@@ tened .
so Sa@@ ul took the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel , and fought against all his enem@@ ies on every side , against Mo@@ a@@ b , and against the children of Am@@ mon , and against E@@ dom , and against the kings of Z@@ ob@@ ah , and against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever he turned himself , he v@@ ex@@ ed them .
now the sons of Sa@@ ul were Jon@@ athan , and I@@ sh@@ u@@ i , and Mel@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ u@@ a : and the names of his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were these ; the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ a@@ b , and the name of the younger Mic@@ hal :
and the name of Sa@@ ul 's wife was Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am , the daughter of Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az : and the name of the captain of his host was Ab@@ ner , the son of N@@ er , Sa@@ ul 's un@@ cle .
and when Samuel rose early to meet Sa@@ ul in the morning , it was told Samuel , saying , Sa@@ ul came to Car@@ mel , and , be@@ hold , he set him up a place , and is gone about , and passed on , and gone down to G@@ ilg@@ al .
David said moreover , The Lord that delivered me out of the pa@@ w of the lion , and out of the pa@@ w of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phil@@ ist@@ ine . and Sa@@ ul said un@@ to David , G@@ o , and the Lord be with the@@ e .
and he took his staff in his hand , and chose him five smooth stones out of the Bro@@ ok , and put them in a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's bag which he had , even in a s@@ cri@@ p ; and his s@@ ling was in his hand : and he drew near to the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
and David put his hand in his bag , and took th@@ ence a stone , and s@@ lan@@ g it , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his fore@@ head , that the stone sun@@ k into his fore@@ head ; and he fell upon his face to the ear@@ th .
therefore David ran , and stood upon the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and took his s@@ word , and drew it out of the she@@ ath there@@ of , and sle@@ w him , and cut off his head there@@ with . and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
and Jon@@ athan stri@@ pped himself of the ro@@ be that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his gar@@ ments , even to his s@@ word , and to his bo@@ w , and to his gir@@ dle .
then the pr@@ inces of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David beha@@ ved himself more wis@@ ely than all the servants of Sa@@ ul ; so that his name was much set by .
and when th@@ ou h@@ ast stayed three days , then th@@ ou s@@ halt go down quickly , and come to the place where th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st hide th@@ y@@ self when the business was in hand , and s@@ halt remain by the stone E@@ z@@ el .
and every one that was in dist@@ ress , and every one that was in debt , and every one that was dis@@ conten@@ ted , gathered themselves un@@ to him ; and he became a captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
Sa@@ ul also and his men went to seek him . and they told David : where@@ fore he came down into a rock , and abo@@ de in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on . and when Sa@@ ul heard that , he pursu@@ ed after David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on .
and Sa@@ ul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made has@@ te to get away for fear of Sa@@ ul ; for Sa@@ ul and his men comp@@ ass@@ ed David and his men round about to take them .
and it came to pass , when Sa@@ ul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , be@@ hold , David is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di .
now the name of the man was Nab@@ al ; and the name of his wife A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful coun@@ tenance : but the man was chur@@ lish and ev@@ il in his do@@ ings ; and he was of the house of Cal@@ e@@ b .
I pra@@ y the@@ e , for@@ give the t@@ res@@ pass of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id : for the Lord will certainly make my lor@@ d a sure house ; because my lor@@ d figh@@ te@@ th the batt@@ les of the Lord , and ev@@ il hat@@ h not been found in the@@ e all TH@@ Y days .
yet a man is risen to pursue the@@ e , and to seek TH@@ Y sou@@ l : but the sou@@ l of my lor@@ d shall be bound in the bun@@ dle of life with the Lord TH@@ Y God ; and the so@@ ul@@ s of th@@ ine enem@@ ies , them shall he s@@ ling out , as out of the middle of a s@@ ling .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord shall have done to my lor@@ d according to all the good that he hat@@ h spoken concerning the@@ e , and shall have appointed the@@ e ru@@ ler over Israel ;
that this shall be no gri@@ ef un@@ to the@@ e , nor off@@ ence of heart un@@ to my lor@@ d , either that th@@ ou h@@ ast shed blood ca@@ us@@ ele@@ ss , or that my lor@@ d hat@@ h av@@ en@@ ged himself : but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lor@@ d , then remember th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id .
and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il came to Nab@@ al ; and , be@@ hold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king ; and Nab@@ al 's heart was mer@@ ry within him , for he was very dr@@ un@@ ken : where@@ fore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
and David ar@@ ose , and came to the place where Sa@@ ul had pit@@ ched : and David be@@ held the place where Sa@@ ul lay , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , the captain of his host : and Sa@@ ul lay in the tren@@ ch , and the people pit@@ ched round about him .
and it came to pass in those days , that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered their armies together for war@@ fare , to fight with Israel . and A@@ ch@@ ish said un@@ to David , K@@ now th@@ ou assu@@ red@@ ly , that th@@ ou s@@ halt go out with me to battle , th@@ ou and TH@@ Y men .
and the woman said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , th@@ ou know@@ est what Sa@@ ul hat@@ h done , how he hat@@ h cut off those that have familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land : where@@ fore then lay@@ est th@@ ou a sn@@ are for my life , to cause me to die ?
and the Lord hat@@ h done to him , as he sp@@ ake by me : for the Lord hat@@ h rent the k@@ ing@@ dom out of th@@ ine hand , and given it to TH@@ Y neighbour , even to David :
and they gave him a piece of a c@@ ake of fig@@ s , and two clu@@ sters of ra@@ is@@ ins : and when he had e@@ aten , his spirit came again to him : for he had e@@ aten no bread , nor dr@@ un@@ k any water , three days and three n@@ ights .
all the val@@ i@@ ant men ar@@ ose , and went all night , and took the body of Sa@@ ul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth @@@ -@@ @ S@@ han , and came to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and bur@@ n@@ t them there .
it came even to pass on the third day , that , be@@ hold , a man came out of the camp from Sa@@ ul with his clo@@ th@@ es rent , and ear@@ th upon his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the ear@@ th , and did obe@@ is@@ ance .
and they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fas@@ ted until even , for Sa@@ ul , and for Jon@@ athan his son , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the s@@ word .
and David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad , and said un@@ to them , b@@ les@@ sed be ye of the Lord , that ye have she@@ wed this kin@@ d@@ ness un@@ to your lor@@ d , even un@@ to Sa@@ ul , and have buried him .
and Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , and the servants of David , went out , and met together by the pool of Gi@@ be@@ on : and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
and Ab@@ ner also sp@@ ake in the e@@ ars of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the e@@ ars of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
and let it be , when th@@ ou hear@@ est the sound of a going in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then th@@ ou s@@ halt b@@ esti@@ r th@@ y@@ self : for then shall the Lord go out before the@@ e , to sm@@ ite the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and he dealt among all the people , even among the whole multi@@ tude of Israel , as well to the women as men , to every one a c@@ ake of bread , and a good piece of f@@ les@@ h , and a fla@@ g@@ on of wine . so all the people depar@@ ted every one to his house .
whereas I have not d@@ wel@@ t in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and I was with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test , and have cut off all th@@ ine enem@@ ies out of TH@@ Y sight , and have made the@@ e a great name , like un@@ to the name of the great men that are in the ear@@ th .
and when TH@@ Y days be fulfilled , and th@@ ou s@@ halt sle@@ ep with TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , I will set up TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e , which shall proceed out of TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s , and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
and he smo@@ te Mo@@ a@@ b , and meas@@ ured them with a line , casting them down to the ground ; even with two lines meas@@ ured he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive . and so the Mo@@ abi@@ tes became David 's servants , and brought gifts .
then said Z@@ ib@@ a un@@ to the king , Accor@@ ding to all that my lor@@ d the king hat@@ h comman@@ ded his ser@@ vant , so shall TH@@ Y ser@@ vant do . as for M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h , said the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king 's sons .
and the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate : and the Syri@@ ans of Z@@ ob@@ a , and of Re@@ ho@@ b , and Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ to@@ b , and Ma@@ ac@@ ah , were by themselves in the field .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans were fled , then fled they also before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . so Jo@@ a@@ b returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jer@@ usalem .
and it came to pass in an even@@ ing@@ ti@@ de , that David ar@@ ose from off his bed , and walked upon the ro@@ of of the king 's house : and from the ro@@ of he saw a woman w@@ ashing her@@ self ; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon .
and I gave the@@ e TH@@ Y master 's house , and TH@@ Y master 's wi@@ ves into TH@@ Y bos@@ om , and gave the@@ e the house of Israel and of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given un@@ to the@@ e such and such things .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will raise up ev@@ il against the@@ e out of th@@ ine own house , and I will take TH@@ Y wi@@ ves before th@@ ine eyes , and give them un@@ to TH@@ Y neighbour , and he shall lie with TH@@ Y wi@@ ves in the sight of this sun .
so Am@@ non lay down , and made himself si@@ ck : and when the king was come to see him , Am@@ non said un@@ to the king , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let Tam@@ ar my sister come , and make me a couple of cak@@ es in my sight , that I may eat at her hand .
so Tam@@ ar went to her brother Am@@ non 's house ; and he was laid down . and she took fl@@ our , and k@@ ne@@ aded it , and made cak@@ es in his sight , and did bak@@ e the cak@@ es .
and I , w@@ hi@@ ther shall I cause my sh@@ ame to go ? and as for the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt be as one of the fo@@ ols in Israel . now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , speak un@@ to the king ; for he will not with@@ hold me from the@@ e .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that ti@@ dings came to David , saying , Ab@@ sal@@ om hat@@ h sla@@ in all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of speaking , that , be@@ hold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice and we@@ pt : and the king also and all his servants we@@ pt very sor@@ e .
now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing un@@ to my lor@@ d the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and TH@@ Y hand@@ ma@@ id said , I will now speak un@@ to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his hand@@ ma@@ id .
and Jo@@ a@@ b fell to the ground on his face , and bo@@ wed himself , and thanked the king : and Jo@@ a@@ b said , To day TH@@ Y ser@@ vant know@@ eth that I have found grace in TH@@ Y sight , my lor@@ d , O king , in that the king hat@@ h fulfilled the request of his ser@@ vant .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his fo@@ ot even to the cro@@ wn of his head there was no ble@@ mis@@ h in him .
and when he polled his head , ( for it was at every year 's end that he polled it : because the ha@@ ir was heavy on him , therefore he polled it : ) he weighed the ha@@ ir of his head at two hundred sh@@ ek@@ els after the king 's weight .
and lo Zad@@ ok also , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes were with him , bearing the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God : and they set down the Ar@@ k of God ; and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
and David went up by the as@@ cent of mount Oli@@ vet , and we@@ pt as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , we@@ eping as they went up .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he wor@@ shi@@ pped God , be@@ hold , Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite came to meet him with his co@@ at rent , and ear@@ th upon his head :
and h@@ ast th@@ ou not there with the@@ e Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt hear out of the king 's house , th@@ ou s@@ halt tell it to Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests .
and when king David came to Ba@@ hur@@ im , be@@ hold , th@@ ence came out a man of the family of the house of Sa@@ ul , whose name was Shi@@ me@@ i , the son of Ger@@ a : he came forth , and Cur@@ sed still as he came .
for , said Hus@@ hai , th@@ ou know@@ est TH@@ Y father and his men , that they be m@@ igh@@ ty men , and they be c@@ haf@@ ed in their min@@ ds , as a bear ro@@ bbed of her whel@@ ps in the field : and TH@@ Y father is a man of war , and will not lo@@ dge with the people .
and he also that is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall ut@@ ter@@ ly mel@@ t : for all Israel know@@ eth that TH@@ Y father is a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and they which be with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light upon him as the dew fal@@ le@@ th on the ground : and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
and when A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el saw that his coun@@ sel was not followed , he s@@ add@@ led his ass , and ar@@ ose , and g@@ at him home to his house , to his city , and put his household in order , and han@@ ged himself , and died , and was buried in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of his father .
and Jo@@ a@@ b came into the house to the king , and said , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast sha@@ med this day the faces of all TH@@ Y servants , which this day have sav@@ ed TH@@ Y life , and the lives of TH@@ Y sons and of TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the lives of TH@@ Y wi@@ ves , and the lives of TH@@ Y conc@@ ub@@ ines ;
and there went out after him Jo@@ a@@ b 's men , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men : and they went out of Jer@@ usalem , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
but the king took the two sons of R@@ iz@@ p@@ ah the daughter of A@@ i@@ ah , whom she b@@ are un@@ to Sa@@ ul , Ar@@ mon@@ i and M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ; and the five sons of Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul , whom she brought up for Adri@@ el the son of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the Me@@ ho@@ la@@ th@@ ite :
and David sp@@ ake un@@ to the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enem@@ ies , and out of the hand of Sa@@ ul :
and that br@@ ing@@ eth me forth from mine enem@@ ies : th@@ ou also h@@ ast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered me from the violent man .
these be the names of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had : the T@@ ach@@ mon@@ ite that sat in the seat , chief among the cap@@ tains ; the same was Ad@@ ino the E@@ z@@ n@@ ite : he lift up his spe@@ ar against eight hundred , whom he sle@@ w at one time .
and the three m@@ igh@@ ty men br@@ ake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink there@@ of , but p@@ oured it out un@@ to the Lord .
and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man , of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done many acts , he sle@@ w two li@@ on@@ like men of Mo@@ a@@ b : he went down also and sle@@ w a lion in the mid@@ st of a p@@ it in time of snow :
and he sle@@ w an Egyptian , a good@@ ly man : and the Egyptian had a spe@@ ar in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and p@@ lu@@ cked the spe@@ ar out of the Egyptian 's hand , and sle@@ w him with his own spe@@ ar .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing the king 's word prev@@ ailed against Jo@@ a@@ b , and against the cap@@ tains of the host . and Jo@@ a@@ b and the cap@@ tains of the host went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
and Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the number of the people un@@ to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand val@@ i@@ ant men that drew the s@@ word ; and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h were five hundred thousand men .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore his servants said un@@ to him , Let there be sought for my lor@@ d the king a young vir@@ gin : and let her stand before the king , and let her ch@@ er@@ ish him , and let her lie in TH@@ Y bos@@ om , that my lor@@ d the king may get heat .
and th@@ ou , my lor@@ d , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon the@@ e , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest tell them who shall sit on the th@@ r@@ one of my lor@@ d the king after him .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Jo@@ a@@ b , and upon the head of his se@@ ed for ever : but upon David , and upon his se@@ ed , and upon his house , and upon his th@@ r@@ one , shall there be peace for ever from the Lord .
for it shall be , that on the day th@@ ou go@@ est out , and pass@@ est over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , th@@ ou s@@ halt know for certain that th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely die : TH@@ Y blood shall be upon th@@ ine own head .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shi@@ me@@ i ran away un@@ to A@@ ch@@ ish son of Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h king of G@@ ath . and they told Shi@@ me@@ i , saying , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y servants be in G@@ ath .
and it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also : and we were together ; there was no st@@ ran@@ ger with us in the house , save we two in the house .
the son of Ge@@ ber , in Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad ; to him per@@ tained the towns of J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which are in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ; to him also per@@ tained the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , which is in B@@ ash@@ an , thre@@ es@@ core great cities with walls and br@@ as@@ en bars :
for he had domin@@ ion over all the region on this side the river , from Ti@@ ph@@ sa@@ h even to Az@@ z@@ ah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and it came to pass in the four hundred and eigh@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Z@@ if , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of the Lord .
the ne@@ ther@@ most chamber was five cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the middle was six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the third was seven cu@@ bi@@ ts broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narro@@ wed rests round about , that the be@@ ams should not be fas@@ tened in the walls of the house .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought th@@ ither : so that there was neither ham@@ mer nor ax@@ e nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
concerning this house which th@@ ou art in building , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t walk in my stat@@ utes , and exec@@ ute my judg@@ ments , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments to walk in them ; then will I perform my word with the@@ e , which I sp@@ ake un@@ to David TH@@ Y father :
and he built the walls of the house within with boards of c@@ ed@@ ar , both the floor of the house , and the walls of the ci@@ el@@ ing : and he covered them on the inside with wood , and covered the floor of the house with plan@@ ks of f@@ ir .
and five cu@@ bi@@ ts was the one wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the other wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the one wing un@@ to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the other were ten cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he set the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms within the in@@ ner house : and they stret@@ ched forth the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b touched the other wall ; and their w@@ ings touched one another in the mid@@ st of the house .
and in the ele@@ venth year , in the month B@@ ul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts there@@ of , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
and he made two chap@@ it@@ ers of m@@ ol@@ ten br@@ ass , to set upon the tops of the pil@@ lars : the he@@ ight of the one chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of the other chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts :
and he set up the pil@@ lars in the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le : and he set up the right pil@@ lar , and called the name there@@ of J@@ ach@@ in : and he set up the left pil@@ lar , and he called the name there@@ of Bo@@ az .
and he made a m@@ ol@@ ten sea , ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from the one bri@@ m to the other : it was round all about , and his he@@ ight was five cu@@ bi@@ ts : and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it round about .
it stood upon twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eas@@ tw@@ ard over against the south .
the two pil@@ lars , and the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers that were on the top of the two pil@@ lars ; and the two networks , to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ons , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the cen@@ s@@ ers of p@@ ure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the in@@ ner house , the most hol@@ y place , and for the doors of the house , to w@@ it , of the temp@@ le .
so was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord . and Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated ; even the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the chief of the fa@@ thers of the children of Israel , un@@ to king Solomon in Jer@@ usalem , that they might bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tab@@ ern@@ acle , even those did the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes bring up .
and king Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , that were assemb@@ led un@@ to him , were with him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and ox@@ en , that could not be told nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
and the pri@@ ests brought in the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord un@@ to his place , into the or@@ acle of the house , to the most hol@@ y place , even under the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms .
and the Lord hat@@ h performed his word that he sp@@ ake , and I am risen up in the room of David my father , and sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
who h@@ ast kept with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father that th@@ ou promis@@ ed@@ st him : th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est also with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and h@@ ast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
yet have th@@ ou respect un@@ to the pray@@ er of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and to his supp@@ lic@@ ation , O Lord my God , to he@@ arken un@@ to the cry and to the pray@@ er , which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant pray@@ eth before the@@ e to day :
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en , and do , and judge TH@@ Y servants , condemning the w@@ ic@@ ked , to bring his way upon his head ; and jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , to give him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of TH@@ Y servants , and of TH@@ Y people Israel , that th@@ ou te@@ ach them the good way where@@ in they should walk , and give rain upon TH@@ Y land , which th@@ ou h@@ ast given to TH@@ Y people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart th@@ ou know@@ est ; ( for th@@ ou , even th@@ ou only , know@@ est the hear@@ ts of all the children of men ; )
if they sin against the@@ e , ( for there is no man that sin@@ net@@ h not , ) and th@@ ou be angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away cap@@ tives un@@ to the land of the enemy , far or near ;
yet if they shall be@@ think themselves in the land w@@ hi@@ ther they were carried cap@@ tives , and rep@@ ent , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation un@@ to the@@ e in the land of them that carried them cap@@ tives , saying , We have sin@@ ned , and have done per@@ ver@@ sely , we have committed w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ;
and so return un@@ to the@@ e with all their heart , and with all their sou@@ l , in the land of their enem@@ ies , which led them away cap@@ tive , and pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e toward their land , which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to their fa@@ thers , the city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and the house which I have built for TH@@ Y name :
and for@@ give TH@@ Y people that have sin@@ ned against the@@ e and all their trans@@ gres@@ sions where@@ in they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against the@@ e , and give them comp@@ as@@ sion before them who carried them cap@@ tive , that they may have comp@@ as@@ sion on them :
and it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing all this pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation un@@ to the Lord , he ar@@ ose from before the alt@@ ar of the Lord , from k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing on his k@@ ne@@ es with his hands spread up to heav@@ en .
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord , that hat@@ h given rest un@@ to his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hat@@ h not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Mos@@ es his ser@@ vant .
and let these my words , where@@ with I have made supp@@ lic@@ ation before the Lord , be n@@ igh un@@ to the Lord our God day and night , that he maintain the cause of his ser@@ vant , and the cause of his people Israel at all times , as the matter shall require :
and it came to pass , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have hal@@ low@@ ed for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a pro@@ ver@@ b and a by@@ word among all people :
( now H@@ i@@ ram the king of T@@ y@@ re had fur@@ n@@ ished Solomon with c@@ ed@@ ar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ il@@ ee .
and she came to Jer@@ usalem with a very great train , with ca@@ me@@ ls that b@@ are sp@@ ices , and very much gold , and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she commun@@ ed with him of all that was in her heart .
and a char@@ i@@ ot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and an hor@@ se for an hundred and fif@@ ty : and so for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and for the kings of Syria , did they bring them out by their means .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the Lord said un@@ to Solomon , For@@ as@@ much as this is done of the@@ e , and th@@ ou h@@ ast not kept my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and my stat@@ utes , which I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , I will su@@ rely ren@@ d the k@@ ing@@ dom from the@@ e , and will give it to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant .
and they ar@@ ose out of Mi@@ dian , and came to Par@@ an : and they took men with them out of Par@@ an , and they came to Egypt , un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him vic@@ tuals , and gave him land .
and it came to pass at that time when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am went out of Jer@@ usalem , that the pro@@ phe@@ t A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; and he had cla@@ d himself with a new gar@@ ment ; and they two were alone in the field :
and it came to pass , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am d@@ wel@@ t in Egypt ; )
and the young men that were grown up with him sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou speak un@@ to this people that sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Th@@ y father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make th@@ ou it ligh@@ ter un@@ to us ; thus s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to them , My little fin@@ ger shall be th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's lo@@ ins .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the tri@@ bute ; and all Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
and it came to pass , when all Israel heard that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was come again , that they sent and called him un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none that followed the house of David , but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jer@@ usalem , then shall the heart of this people turn again un@@ to their lor@@ d , even un@@ to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall kill me , and go again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
now there d@@ wel@@ t an old pro@@ phe@@ t in Be@@ the@@ l ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l : the words which he had spoken un@@ to the king , them they told also to their father .
but ca@@ me@@ st back , and h@@ ast e@@ aten bread and dr@@ un@@ k water in the place , of the which the Lord did say to the@@ e , eat no bread , and drink no water ; TH@@ Y car@@ case shall not come un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers .
and it came to pass , after he had e@@ aten bread , and after he had dr@@ un@@ k , that he s@@ add@@ led for him the ass , to w@@ it , for the pro@@ phe@@ t whom he had brought back .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and sle@@ w him : and his car@@ case was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the car@@ case .
and , be@@ hold , men passed by , and saw the car@@ case cast in the way , and the lion standing by the car@@ case : and they came and told it in the city where the old pro@@ phe@@ t d@@ wel@@ t .
and the pro@@ phe@@ t took up the car@@ case of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old pro@@ phe@@ t came to the city , to mour@@ n and to bur@@ y him .
and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am 's wife did so , and ar@@ ose , and went to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and came to the house of A@@ hij@@ ah . but A@@ hij@@ ah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
and rent the k@@ ing@@ dom away from the house of David , and gave it the@@ e : and yet th@@ ou h@@ ast not been as my ser@@ vant David , who kept my comman@@ d@@ ments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ;
and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , and turned not aside from any thing that he comman@@ ded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the Lord , silver , and gold , and vessels .
and it came to pass , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his th@@ r@@ one , that he sle@@ w all the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha : he left him not one that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against a wall , neither of his k@@ ins@@ fol@@ ks , nor of his friends .
and it came to pass , when Z@@ im@@ ri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king 's house , and bur@@ n@@ t the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
now the rest of the acts of Om@@ ri which he did , and his might that he she@@ wed , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and it came to pass , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , that he took to wife J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel the daughter of Eth@@ ba@@ al king of the Z@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and went and served Ba@@ al , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him .
and it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mist@@ ress of the house , fell si@@ ck ; and his si@@ ck@@ ness was so sor@@ e , that there was no bre@@ ath left in him .
and it was so , when Eli@@ j@@ ah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his man@@ tle , and went out , and stood in the entering in of the cave . and , be@@ hold , there came a voice un@@ to him , and said , What do@@ est th@@ ou here , Eli@@ j@@ ah ?
and it shall come to pass , that him that escap@@ eth the s@@ word of Haz@@ a@@ el shall J@@ eh@@ u s@@ lay : and him that escap@@ eth from the s@@ word of J@@ eh@@ u shall E@@ lis@@ ha s@@ lay .
yet I will send my servants un@@ to the@@ e to mor@@ row about this time , and they shall search th@@ ine house , and the houses of TH@@ Y servants ; and it shall be , that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is pleas@@ ant in th@@ ine eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away .
and it came to pass at the return of the year , that Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad num@@ ber@@ ed the Syri@@ ans , and went up to A@@ ph@@ ek , to fight against Israel .
and the men of his city , even the el@@ ders and the no@@ bles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent un@@ to them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent un@@ to them .
and it came to pass , when A@@ ha@@ b heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ ha@@ b rose up to go down to the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
and will make th@@ ine house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , for the provoc@@ ation where@@ with th@@ ou h@@ ast provoked me to an@@ ger , and made Israel to sin .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , su@@ rely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
and one was@@ hed the char@@ i@@ ot in the pool of Samar@@ ia ; and the do@@ gs lic@@ ked up his blood ; and they was@@ hed his arm@@ our ; according un@@ to the word of the Lord which he sp@@ ake .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ ha@@ b , and all that he did , and the Iv@@ ory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and he walked in all the ways of A@@ SA his father ; he turned not aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord : nevertheless the high places were not taken away ; for the people offered and bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se yet in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and his might that he she@@ wed , and how he war@@ red , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin :
but the an@@ gel of the Lord said to Eli@@ j@@ ah the T@@ ish@@ bi@@ te , arise , go up to meet the mes@@ sen@@ gers of the king of Samar@@ ia , and say un@@ to them , Is it not because there is not a God in Israel , that ye go to inqu@@ ire of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ z@@ e@@ bu@@ b the go@@ d of E@@ kr@@ on ?
then the king sent un@@ to him a captain of fif@@ ty with his fif@@ ty . and he went up to him : and , be@@ hold , he sat on the top of an hill . and he sp@@ ake un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u man of God , the king hat@@ h said , C@@ ome down .
and it came to pass , as they still went on , and talked , that , be@@ hold , there appeared a char@@ i@@ ot of fire , and hor@@ ses of fire , and par@@ ted them both as@@ under ; and Eli@@ j@@ ah went up by a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind into heav@@ en .
and he went up from th@@ ence un@@ to Be@@ the@@ l : and as he was going up by the way , there came forth little children out of the city , and mo@@ cked him , and said un@@ to him , G@@ o up , th@@ ou bal@@ d head ; go up , th@@ ou bal@@ d head .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the king of E@@ dom : and they f@@ et@@ ched a comp@@ ass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the c@@ attle that followed them .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , Y@@ e shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that val@@ ley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your c@@ attle , and your be@@ asts .
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his m@@ outh upon his m@@ outh , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stret@@ ched himself upon the child ; and the f@@ les@@ h of the child wa@@ xed warm .
so they p@@ oured out for the men to eat . and it came to pass , as they were e@@ ating of the po@@ tt@@ age , that they cri@@ ed out , and said , O th@@ ou man of God , there is death in the po@@ t . and they could not eat there@@ of .
and it was so , when E@@ lis@@ ha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clo@@ th@@ es , that he sent to the king , saying , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou rent TH@@ Y clo@@ th@@ es ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a pro@@ phe@@ t in Israel .
and it came to pass , when they were come into Samar@@ ia , that E@@ lis@@ ha said , Lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . and the Lord opened their eyes , and they saw ; and , be@@ hold , they were in the mid@@ st of Samar@@ ia .
and it came to pass , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es ; and he passed by upon the wall , and the people looked , and , be@@ hold , he had s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th within upon his f@@ les@@ h .
and they rose up in the tw@@ il@@ ight , to go un@@ to the camp of the Syri@@ ans : and when they were come to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of Syria , be@@ hold , there was no man there .
and it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and she went forth to cry un@@ to the king for her house and for her land .
and he walked in the way of the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for he was the son in law of the house of A@@ ha@@ b .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite the house of A@@ ha@@ b TH@@ Y master , that I may av@@ en@@ ge the blood of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
and J@@ eh@@ u sent through all Israel : and all the wor@@ ship@@ pers of Ba@@ al came , so that there was not a man left that came not . and they came into the house of Ba@@ al ; and the house of Ba@@ al was full from one end to another .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin , J@@ eh@@ u depar@@ ted not from after them , to w@@ it , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
and he comman@@ ded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath shall even be ke@@ epers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and a third part shall be at the gate of S@@ ur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
and ye shall comp@@ ass the king around about , every man with his weapons in his hand : and he that co@@ me@@ th within the ran@@ ges , let him be sla@@ in : and be ye with the king as he go@@ eth out and as he co@@ me@@ th in .
and the cap@@ tains over the hundreds did according to all things that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded : and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , with them that should go out on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , and came to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right cor@@ ner of the temp@@ le to the left cor@@ ner of the temp@@ le , along by the alt@@ ar and the temp@@ le .
but Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded the cap@@ tains of the hundreds , the officers of the host , and said un@@ to them , H@@ ave her forth without the ran@@ ges : and him that follow@@ eth her kill with the s@@ word . for the pri@@ est had said , Let her not be sla@@ in in the house of the Lord .
and they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by the which the hor@@ ses came into the king 's house : and there was she sla@@ in .
and all the people of the land went into the house of Ba@@ al , and br@@ ake it down ; his al@@ tar@@ s and his images br@@ ake they in pieces thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly , and sle@@ w Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s . and the pri@@ est appointed officers over the house of the Lord .
and he took the rul@@ ers over hundreds , and the cap@@ tains , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . and he sat on the th@@ r@@ one of the kings .
and it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the ch@@ est , that the king 's s@@ cri@@ be and the high pri@@ est came up , and they put up in bags , and told the money that was found in the house of the Lord .
and they gave the money , being told , into the hands of them that did the work , that had the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord : and they laid it out to the car@@ pen@@ ters and buil@@ ders , that w@@ rought upon the house of the Lord ,
and the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , and his might where@@ with he fought against A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and it came to pass , as they were bur@@ ying a man , that , be@@ hold , they sp@@ ied a band of men ; and they cast the man into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of E@@ lis@@ ha : and when the man was let down , and touched the b@@ ones of E@@ lis@@ ha , he revi@@ ved , and stood up on his feet .
and Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel took A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , the son of Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and came to Jer@@ usalem , and br@@ ake down the wall of Jer@@ usalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im un@@ to the cor@@ ner gate , four hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ ash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
now the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , and his might , how he war@@ red , and how he recovered Dam@@ as@@ cus , and Ham@@ ath , which belonged to Ju@@ da@@ h , for Israel , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as his fa@@ thers had done : he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , ye@@ a , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
so A@@ haz sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to Ti@@ gla@@ th @@@ -@@ @ pil@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , saying , I am TH@@ Y ser@@ vant and TH@@ Y son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
and A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and he brought also the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar , which was before the Lord , from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the house , from between the alt@@ ar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the alt@@ ar .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a brought men from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and from Cu@@ th@@ ah , and from Av@@ a , and from Ham@@ ath , and from Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , and placed them in the cities of Samar@@ ia instead of the children of Israel : and they poss@@ essed Samar@@ ia , and d@@ wel@@ t in the cities there@@ of .
but the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stret@@ ched out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that S@@ hal@@ man@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against Samar@@ ia , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it .
at that time did H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of the temp@@ le of the Lord , and from the pil@@ lars which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent T@@ artan and R@@ ab@@ sar@@ is and Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with a great host against Jer@@ usalem . and they went up and came to Jer@@ usalem . and when they were come up , they came and stood by the con@@ du@@ it of the up@@ per pool , which is in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
now , be@@ hold , th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test upon the staff of this bru@@ ised Re@@ ed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man le@@ an , it will go into his hand , and Pi@@ erce it : so is P@@ har@@ o@@ ah king of Egypt un@@ to all that trust on him .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , give pledges to my lor@@ d the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will deliver the@@ e two thousand hor@@ ses , if th@@ ou be able on TH@@ Y part to set ri@@ ders upon them .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded ; they were as the gr@@ ass of the field , and as the green her@@ b , as the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and as cor@@ n b@@ lasted before it be grown up .
because TH@@ Y ra@@ ge against me and TH@@ Y t@@ um@@ ult is come up into mine e@@ ars , therefore I will put my ho@@ ok in TH@@ Y n@@ ose , and my bri@@ dle in TH@@ Y li@@ ps , and I will turn the@@ e back by the way by which th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st .
and it came to pass that night , that the an@@ gel of the Lord went out , and smo@@ te in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans an hundred fo@@ ur@@ score and five thousand : and when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , they were all dead cor@@ p@@ ses .
and it came to pass , as he was wor@@ shipping in the house of Nis@@ ro@@ ch his go@@ d , that Ad@@ ram@@ me@@ le@@ ch and Shar@@ ez@@ er his sons smo@@ te him with the s@@ word : and they escaped into the land of Armenia . and E@@ sar @@@ -@@ @ h@@ add@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and all his might , and how he made a pool , and a con@@ du@@ it , and brought water into the city , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and all that he did , and his sin that he sin@@ ned , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , Th@@ y servants have gathered the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work , that have the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord .
so H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , and A@@ ch@@ bor , and Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ sahi@@ ah , went un@@ to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Ti@@ k@@ v@@ ah , the son of Har@@ has , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ; ( now she d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem in the colle@@ ge ; ) and they commun@@ ed with her .
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wr@@ ath shall be kin@@ d@@ led against this place , and shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
be@@ hold therefore , I will gather the@@ e un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be gathered into TH@@ Y grave in peace ; and th@@ ine eyes shall not see all the ev@@ il which I will bring upon this place . and they brought the king word again .
and he brought out the gro@@ ve from the house of the Lord , without Jer@@ usalem , un@@ to the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and burned it at the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and st@@ amp@@ ed it small to pow@@ der , and cast the pow@@ der there@@ of upon the graves of the children of the people .
and the al@@ tar@@ s that were on the top of the up@@ per chamber of A@@ haz , which the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h had made , and the al@@ tar@@ s which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , did the king beat down , and br@@ ake them down from th@@ ence , and cast the d@@ ust of them into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samar@@ ia , which the kings of Israel had made to prov@@ oke the Lord to an@@ ger , Jos@@ i@@ ah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Be@@ the@@ l .
and like un@@ to him was there no king before him , that turned to the Lord with all his heart , and with all his sou@@ l , and with all his might , according to all the law of Mos@@ es ; neither after him ar@@ ose there any like him .
and his servants carried him in a char@@ i@@ ot dead from Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and buried him in his own se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re . and the people of the land took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and ano@@ in@@ ted him , and made him king in his father 's stead .
and the Lord sent against him bands of the Chal@@ de@@ es , and bands of the Syri@@ ans , and bands of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , and bands of the children of Am@@ mon , and sent them against Ju@@ da@@ h to destroy it , according to the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h went out to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and his officers : and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took him in the eighth year of his reign .
and he carried out th@@ ence all the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temp@@ le of the Lord , as the Lord had said .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he , and all his host , against Jer@@ usalem , and pit@@ ched against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it round about .
and in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which is the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan , captain of the guard , a ser@@ vant of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem :
now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the re@@ mn@@ ant of the multi@@ tude , did Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carry away .
and the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the br@@ as@@ en sea that was in the house of the Lord , did the Chal@@ de@@ es break in pieces , and carried the br@@ ass of them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and as for the people that remained in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left , even over them he made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , ru@@ ler .
and when all the cap@@ tains of the armies , they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah governor , there came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , even I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ a@@ hi@@ ah , and Johan@@ an the son of C@@ are@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of a Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , they and their men .
but it came to pass in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the se@@ ed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smo@@ te G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chal@@ de@@ es that were with him at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
the sons of She@@ lah the son of Ju@@ da@@ h were , E@@ R the father of L@@ ec@@ ah , and La@@ ad@@ ah the father of Mar@@ es@@ ha@@ h , and the families of the house of them that w@@ rought fine lin@@ en , of the house of Ash@@ be@@ a ,
and some of them , even of the sons of Simeon , five hundred men , went to mount Se@@ ir , having for their cap@@ tains Pe@@ la@@ ti@@ ah , and N@@ ear@@ i@@ ah , and Rep@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and Uz@@ zi@@ el , the sons of I@@ sh@@ i .
these are the children of A@@ bi@@ ha@@ il the son of Hur@@ i , the son of Jar@@ o@@ ah , the son of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Michael , the son of J@@ es@@ his@@ hai , the son of Jah@@ do , the son of B@@ uz ;
the sons of Re@@ ub@@ en , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , of val@@ i@@ ant men , men able to bear bu@@ ck@@ ler and s@@ word , and to sho@@ ot with bo@@ w , and s@@ kil@@ ful in war , were four and for@@ ty thousand seven hundred and thre@@ es@@ core , that went out to the war .
and these were the heads of the house of their fa@@ thers , even Ep@@ her , and I@@ sh@@ i , and Eli@@ el , and Az@@ ri@@ el , and Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and Ho@@ da@@ vi@@ ah , and Jah@@ di@@ el , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , famous men , and heads of the house of their fa@@ thers .
and un@@ to the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h , which were left of the family of that tri@@ be , were cities given out of the half tri@@ be , name@@ ly , out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , by lot , ten cities .
and to the sons of Ger@@ sho@@ m throughout their families out of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tri@@ be of As@@ her , and out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in B@@ ash@@ an , thir@@ teen cities .
un@@ to the sons of Mer@@ ari were given by lot , throughout their families , out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , and out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , twelve cities .
and they gave by lot out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin , these cities , which are called by their names .
and the sons of Bel@@ a ; E@@ z@@ bon , and Uz@@ zi , and Uz@@ zi@@ el , and Jer@@ im@@ o@@ th , and I@@ RI , five ; heads of the house of their fa@@ thers , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our ; and were rec@@ kon@@ ed by their gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gies twenty and two thousand and thirty and four .
and by the borders of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean and her towns , Ta@@ an@@ ach and her towns , Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and her towns , D@@ or and her towns . in these d@@ wel@@ t the children of Joseph the son of Israel .
all these were the children of As@@ her , heads of their father 's house , choice and m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , chief of the pr@@ inces . and the number throughout the gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of them that were ap@@ t to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men .
and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of P@@ ash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah , and Ma@@ asi@@ ai the son of A@@ di@@ el , the son of Jah@@ zer@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ lem@@ ith , the son of Im@@ mer ;
and Ob@@ adi@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Gal@@ al , the son of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of A@@ SA , the son of El@@ kan@@ ah , that d@@ wel@@ t in the villages of the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ites .
they ar@@ ose , all the val@@ i@@ ant men , and took away the body of Sa@@ ul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and buried their b@@ ones under the o@@ ak in J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and fas@@ ted seven days .
and moreover in time past , even when Sa@@ ul was king , th@@ ou w@@ ast he that led@@ dest out and b@@ rough@@ test in Israel : and the Lord TH@@ Y God said un@@ to the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fe@@ ed my people Israel , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be ru@@ ler over my people Israel , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be ru@@ ler over my people Israel .
and the three br@@ ake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but p@@ oured it out to the Lord ,
now these are they that came to David to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , while he yet kept himself close because of Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish : and they were among the m@@ igh@@ ty men , hel@@ pers of the war .
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to David to He@@ br@@ on , to turn the k@@ ing@@ dom of Sa@@ ul to him , according to the word of the Lord .
and it shall be , when th@@ ou s@@ halt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then th@@ ou s@@ halt go out to battle : for God is gone forth before the@@ e to sm@@ ite the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and David was clo@@ th@@ ed with a ro@@ be of fine lin@@ en , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes that b@@ are the Ar@@ k , and the singers , and Chen@@ an@@ i@@ ah the master of the song with the singers : David also had upon him an ep@@ ho@@ d of lin@@ en .
and it shall come to pass , when TH@@ Y days be expired that th@@ ou must go to be with TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , that I will raise up TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e , which shall be of TH@@ Y sons ; and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
and yet this was a small thing in th@@ ine eyes , O God ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast also spoken of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant 's house for a great while to come , and h@@ ast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , O Lord God .
them also king David dedicated un@@ to the Lord , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from E@@ dom , and from Mo@@ a@@ b , and from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from A@@ mal@@ ek .
and he said , If the Syri@@ ans be too strong for me , then th@@ ou s@@ halt help me : but if the children of Am@@ mon be too strong for the@@ e , then I will help the@@ e .
and when the Syri@@ ans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and drew forth the Syri@@ ans that were beyond the river : and S@@ hop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and David took the cro@@ wn of their king from off his head , and found it to we@@ igh a tal@@ ent of gold , and there were pre@@ ci@@ ous stones in it ; and it was set upon David 's head : and he brought also exceeding much sp@@ oil out of the city .
and Jo@@ a@@ b gave the sum of the number of the people un@@ to David . and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew s@@ word : and Ju@@ da@@ h was four hundred thre@@ es@@ core and ten thousand men that drew s@@ word .
now , be@@ hold , in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand tal@@ ents of gold , and a thousand thousand tal@@ ents of silver ; and of br@@ ass and iron without weight ; for it is in ab@@ und@@ ance : tim@@ ber also and stone have I prepared ; and th@@ ou may@@ est add there@@ to .
these were the sons of L@@ evi after the house of their fa@@ thers ; even the chief of the fa@@ thers , as they were counted by number of names by their polls , that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord , from the age of twenty years and up@@ ward .
because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord , in the courts , and in the ch@@ ambers , and in the pur@@ ifying of all hol@@ y things , and the work of the service of the house of God ;
and there were more chief men found of the sons of Ele@@ azar than of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar ; and thus were they divided . among the sons of Ele@@ azar there were six@@ teen chief men of the house of their fa@@ thers , and eight among the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar according to the house of their fa@@ thers .
moreover David and the cap@@ tains of the host separated to the service of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , and of H@@ eman , and of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , who should pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y with har@@ ps , with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als : and the number of the work@@ men according to their service was :
which S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith and his bre@@ th@@ ren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fa@@ thers , the cap@@ tains over thousands and hundreds , and the cap@@ tains of the host , had dedicated .
and all that Samuel the se@@ er , and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , had dedicated ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith , and of his bre@@ th@@ ren .
among the He@@ bron@@ ites was Jer@@ ij@@ ah the chief , even among the He@@ bron@@ ites , according to the generations of his fa@@ thers . in the for@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our at Jaz@@ er of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pat@@ tern of the por@@ ch , and of the houses there@@ of , and of the treas@@ ur@@ ies there@@ of , and of the up@@ per ch@@ ambers there@@ of , and of the in@@ ner par@@ lo@@ urs there@@ of , and of the place of the mer@@ cy seat ,
and the pat@@ tern of all that he had by the spirit , of the courts of the house of the Lord , and of all the ch@@ ambers round about , of the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of God , and of the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the dedicated things :
also for the courses of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord .
even the weight for the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks of gold , and for their lam@@ ps of gold , by weight for every cand@@ le@@ stick , and for the lam@@ ps there@@ of : and for the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks of silver by weight , both for the cand@@ le@@ stick , and also for the lam@@ ps there@@ of , according to the use of every cand@@ le@@ stick .
moreover , because I have set my aff@@ ection to the house of my God , I have of mine own proper good , of gold and silver , which I have given to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the hol@@ y house ,
the gold for things of gold , and the silver for things of silver , and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of arti@@ fic@@ ers . and who then is willing to consec@@ rate his service this day un@@ to the Lord ?
Th@@ ine , O Lord , is the gre@@ at@@ ness , and the power , and the gl@@ ory , and the victory , and the maj@@ es@@ ty : for all that is in the heav@@ en and in the ear@@ th is th@@ ine ; th@@ ine is the k@@ ing@@ dom , O Lord , and th@@ ou art ex@@ al@@ ted as head above all .
and give un@@ to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments , TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , and TH@@ Y stat@@ utes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
now the acts of David the king , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of Samuel the se@@ er , and in the book of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the book of G@@ ad the se@@ er ,
so Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of God , which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord had made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and they f@@ et@@ ched up , and brought forth out of Egypt a char@@ i@@ ot for six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and an hor@@ se for an hundred and fif@@ ty : and so brought they out hor@@ ses for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and for the kings of Syria , by their means .
and the por@@ ch that was in the front of the house , the length of it was according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight was an hundred and twenty : and he over@@ laid it within with p@@ ure gold .
and he re@@ ar@@ ed up the pil@@ lars before the temp@@ le , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand J@@ ach@@ in , and the name of that on the left Bo@@ az .
it stood upon twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
to w@@ it , the two pil@@ lars , and the pom@@ me@@ ls , and the chap@@ it@@ ers which were on the top of the two pil@@ lars , and the two w@@ re@@ aths to cover the two pom@@ me@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers which were on the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ons , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the cen@@ s@@ ers , of p@@ ure gold : and the entry of the house , the in@@ ner doors there@@ of for the most hol@@ y place , and the doors of the house of the temp@@ le , were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished : and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated ; and the silver , and the gold , and all the instruments , put he among the treasures of the house of God .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the chief of the fa@@ thers of the children of Israel , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
and the pri@@ ests brought in the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord un@@ to his place , to the or@@ acle of the house , into the most hol@@ y place , even under the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms :
and they drew out the st@@ aves of the Ar@@ k , that the ends of the st@@ aves were seen from the Ar@@ k before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen without . and there it is un@@ to this day .
the Lord therefore hat@@ h performed his word that he hat@@ h spoken : for I am risen up in the room of David my father , and am set on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
T@@ ho@@ u which h@@ ast kept with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father that which th@@ ou h@@ ast promised him ; and sp@@ ak@@ est with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and h@@ ast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en , and do , and judge TH@@ Y servants , by requ@@ iting the w@@ ic@@ ked , by re@@ compen@@ sing his way upon his own head ; and by jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , by giving him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of TH@@ Y servants , and of TH@@ Y people Israel , when th@@ ou h@@ ast ta@@ ught them the good way , where@@ in they should walk ; and send rain upon TH@@ Y land , which th@@ ou h@@ ast given un@@ to TH@@ Y people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and ren@@ der un@@ to every man according un@@ to all his ways , whose heart th@@ ou know@@ est ; ( for th@@ ou only know@@ est the hear@@ ts of the children of men : )
moreover concerning the st@@ ran@@ ger , which is not of TH@@ Y people Israel , but is come from a far country for TH@@ Y great name 's sake , and TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and TH@@ Y stret@@ ched out arm ; if they come and pra@@ y in this house ;
if they return to the@@ e with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l in the land of their cap@@ tivity , w@@ hi@@ ther they have carried them cap@@ tives , and pra@@ y toward their land , which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to their fa@@ thers , and toward the city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and toward the house which I have built for TH@@ Y name :
moreover Solomon hal@@ low@@ ed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord : for there he offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the f@@ at of the peace offer@@ ings , because the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the meat offer@@ ings , and the f@@ at .
thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the Lord , and in his own house , he prosp@@ er@@ ously eff@@ ected .
if my people , which are called by my name , shall hum@@ ble themselves , and pra@@ y , and seek my face , and turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked ways ; then will I hear from heav@@ en , and will for@@ give their sin , and will he@@ al their land .
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mos@@ es , on the sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , and on the new mo@@ ons , and on the so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts , three times in the year , even in the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it I believed not their words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , be@@ hold , the one half of the gre@@ at@@ ness of TH@@ Y wis@@ dom was not told me : for th@@ ou exce@@ ede@@ st the f@@ ame that I heard .
and all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , are they not written in the book of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite , and in the visions of I@@ d@@ do the se@@ er against Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at ?
and it came to pass , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who was in Egypt , w@@ hi@@ ther he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am returned out of Egypt .
and the young men that were brought up with him sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou answer the people that sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Th@@ y father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make th@@ ou it somewhat ligh@@ ter for us ; thus s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to them , My little fin@@ ger shall be th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's lo@@ ins .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Had@@ or@@ am that was over the tri@@ bute ; and the children of Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . but king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
and when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was come to Jer@@ usalem , he gathered of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin an hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score thousand chosen men , which were war@@ ri@@ ors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the k@@ ing@@ dom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
so S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jer@@ usalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
and A@@ SA and the people that were with him pursu@@ ed them un@@ to Ger@@ ar : and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians were over@@ thrown , that they could not rec@@ over themselves ; for they were destroyed before the Lord , and before his host ; and they carried away very much sp@@ oil .
and at that time Han@@ ani the se@@ er came to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and said un@@ to him , Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast reli@@ ed on the king of Syria , and not reli@@ ed on the Lord TH@@ Y God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of th@@ ine hand .
and A@@ SA in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was dis@@ eased in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord , but to the physi@@ cians .
also in the third year of his reign he sent to his pr@@ inces , even to Ben @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ il , and to Ob@@ adi@@ ah , and to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and to N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el , and to Micha@@ i@@ ah , to te@@ ach in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h sat either of them on his th@@ r@@ one , clo@@ th@@ ed in their rob@@ es , and they sat in a vo@@ id place at the entering in of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied before them .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , It is the king of Israel . therefore they comp@@ ass@@ ed about him to fight : but J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out , and the Lord helped him ; and God moved them to de@@ part from him .
for it came to pass , that , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
then upon Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ i@@ el , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , a Lev@@ ite of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , came the Spiri@@ t of the Lord in the mid@@ st of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ;
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b to wife : and he w@@ rought that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord .
and they came up into Ju@@ da@@ h , and br@@ ake into it , and carried away all the sub@@ stance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wi@@ ves ; so that there was never a son left him , save Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , the youngest of his sons .
and he returned to be he@@ aled in J@@ ez@@ reel because of the wounds which were given him at Ram@@ ah , when he fought with Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria . and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of J@@ eh@@ or@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h went down to see J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b at J@@ ez@@ reel , because he was si@@ ck .
and it came to pass , that , when J@@ eh@@ u was exec@@ ut@@ ing judgment upon the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and found the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the sons of the bre@@ th@@ ren of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , that minist@@ ered to A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , he sle@@ w them .
and in the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada strengthened himself , and took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Ob@@ ed , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , and E@@ lis@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , into C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with him .
and they went about in Ju@@ da@@ h , and gathered the L@@ evi@@ tes out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the chief of the fa@@ thers of Israel , and they came to Jer@@ usalem .
but let none come into the house of the Lord , save the pri@@ ests , and they that minister of the L@@ evi@@ tes ; they shall go in , for they are hol@@ y : but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall comp@@ ass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever else co@@ me@@ th into the house , he shall be put to death : but be ye with the king when he co@@ me@@ th in , and when he go@@ eth out .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes and all Ju@@ da@@ h did according to all things that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est had comman@@ ded , and took every man his men that were to come in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , with them that were to go out on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath : for Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est dismissed not the courses .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temp@@ le to the left side of the temp@@ le , along by the alt@@ ar and the temp@@ le , by the king round about .
and he took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , and the no@@ bles , and the govern@@ ors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of the Lord : and they came through the high gate into the king 's house , and set the king upon the th@@ r@@ one of the k@@ ing@@ dom .
and the king and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and hired mas@@ ons and car@@ pen@@ ters to repair the house of the Lord , and also such as w@@ rought iron and br@@ ass to mend the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass at the end of the year , that the host of Syria came up against him : and they came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and destroyed all the pr@@ inces of the people from among the people , and sent all the sp@@ oil of them un@@ to the king of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Ju@@ da@@ h carry away cap@@ tive , and brought them un@@ to the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
now it came to pass , after that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah was come from the sla@@ ughter of the E@@ dom@@ ites , that he brought the go@@ ds of the children of Se@@ ir , and set them up to be his go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed down himself before them , and burned incen@@ se un@@ to them .
and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel took A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , the son of Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and br@@ ake down the wall of Jer@@ usalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the cor@@ ner gate , four hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and Uz@@ zi@@ ah the king was a le@@ per un@@ to the day of his death , and d@@ wel@@ t in a several house , being a le@@ per ; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son was over the king 's house , jud@@ ging the people of the land .
then certain of the heads of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Johan@@ an , Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , and Je@@ hiz@@ ki@@ ah the son of S@@ hal@@ lum , and A@@ masa the son of Had@@ la@@ i , stood up against them that came from the war ,
for A@@ haz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the pr@@ inces , and gave it un@@ to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : but he helped him not .
and A@@ haz gathered together the vessels of the house of God , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord , and he made him al@@ tar@@ s in every cor@@ ner of Jer@@ usalem .
for our fa@@ thers have t@@ res@@ passed , and done that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have for@@ sak@@ en him , and have turned away their faces from the habi@@ tation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
then the L@@ evi@@ tes ar@@ ose , Mah@@ ath the son of A@@ mas@@ ai , and Jo@@ el the son of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : and of the sons of Mer@@ ari , K@@ ish the son of Ab@@ di , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hal@@ ele@@ l : and of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites ; Jo@@ ah the son of Z@@ im@@ ma@@ h , and E@@ den the son of Jo@@ ah :
and the pri@@ ests went into the in@@ ner part of the house of the Lord , to cleans@@ e it , and brought out all the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess that they found in the temp@@ le of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord . and the L@@ evi@@ tes took it , to carry it out abroad into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanc@@ ti@@ fy , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the por@@ ch of the Lord : so they sanc@@ ti@@ fied the house of the Lord in eight days ; and in the six@@ teen@@ th day of the first month they made an end .
so they killed the bul@@ loc@@ ks , and the pri@@ ests received the blood , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it on the alt@@ ar : likewise , when they had killed the r@@ ams , they sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood upon the alt@@ ar : they killed also the lam@@ bs , and they sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood upon the alt@@ ar .
now be ye not sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked , as your fa@@ thers were , but yield yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to the Lord , and enter into his sanc@@ tu@@ ary , which he hat@@ h sanc@@ ti@@ fied for ever : and serve the Lord your God , that the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his wr@@ ath may turn away from you .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation that came out of Israel , and the st@@ ran@@ gers that came out of the land of Israel , and that d@@ wel@@ t in Ju@@ da@@ h , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his sub@@ stance for the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , to w@@ it , for the morning and evening bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings for the sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , and for the new mo@@ ons , and for the set fe@@ asts , as it is written in the law of the Lord .
and concerning the children of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h , that d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , they also brought in the ti@@ the of ox@@ en and she@@ ep , and the ti@@ the of hol@@ y things which were consec@@ rated un@@ to the Lord their God , and laid them by he@@ aps .
after this did Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a send his servants to Jer@@ usalem , ( but he himself laid siege against L@@ ach@@ ish , and all his power with him , ) un@@ to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and un@@ to all Ju@@ da@@ h that were at Jer@@ usalem , saying ,
who was there among all the go@@ ds of those nations that my fa@@ thers ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' speech un@@ to the people of Jer@@ usalem that were on the wall , to aff@@ right them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it in the business of the ambassadors of the pr@@ inces of Bab@@ yl@@ on , who sent un@@ to him to inqu@@ ire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
now the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and his Go@@ od@@ ness , be@@ hold , they are written in the vision of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , the son of A@@ mo@@ z , and in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m : also he observed times , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and used wit@@ ch@@ craft , and dealt with a familiar spirit , and with w@@ iz@@ ards : he w@@ rought much ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
and he took away the st@@ range go@@ ds , and the i@@ dol out of the house of the Lord , and all the al@@ tar@@ s that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord , and in Jer@@ usalem , and cast them out of the city .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and his pray@@ er un@@ to his God , and the words of the se@@ ers that sp@@ ake to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
now in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of his reign , when he had p@@ urged the land , and the house , he sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the governor of the city , and Jo@@ ah the son of Jo@@ a@@ haz the rec@@ order , to repair the house of the Lord his God .
and they put it in the hand of the work@@ men that had the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the work@@ men that w@@ rought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house :
and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and have delivered it into the hand of the over@@ se@@ ers , and to the hand of the work@@ men .
and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and they that the king had appointed , went to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Ti@@ k@@ vat@@ h , the son of Has@@ ra@@ h , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ; ( now she d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem in the colle@@ ge : ) and they sp@@ ake to her to that effect .
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wr@@ ath shall be p@@ oured out upon this place , and shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
and Jos@@ i@@ ah gave to the people , of the flock , lam@@ bs and kids , all for the pass@@ over offer@@ ings , for all that were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bul@@ loc@@ ks : these were of the king 's sub@@ stance .
and they removed the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer un@@ to the Lord , as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es . and so did they with the ox@@ en .
his servants therefore took him out of that char@@ i@@ ot , and put him in the second char@@ i@@ ot that he had ; and they brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and he died , and was buried in one of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of his fa@@ thers . and all Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem mour@@ ned for Jos@@ i@@ ah .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and his ab@@ omin@@ ations which he did , and that which was found in him , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h : and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his pr@@ inces ; all these he brought to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of the Lord spoken by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be accomplished , the Lord s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of the Lord by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be fulfilled , the Lord s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
who is there among you of all his people ? his God be with him , and let him go up to Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h , and build the house of the Lord God of Israel , ( he is the God , ) which is in Jer@@ usalem .
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the cap@@ tivity , of those which had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and came again un@@ to Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , every one un@@ to his city ;
the children of the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , in all an hundred thirty and nine .
and of the children of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i ; which took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name :
then stood J@@ es@@ hua with his sons and his bre@@ th@@ ren , Kad@@ mi@@ el and his sons , the sons of Ju@@ da@@ h , together , to set forward the work@@ men in the house of God : the sons of Hen@@ ad@@ ad , with their sons and their bre@@ th@@ ren the L@@ evi@@ tes .
but many of the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes and chief of the fa@@ thers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice ; and many sh@@ ou@@ ted al@@ oud for joy :
so that the people could not dis@@ cer@@ n the no@@ ise of the sh@@ out of joy from the no@@ ise of the we@@ eping of the people : for the people sh@@ ou@@ ted with a l@@ oud sh@@ out , and the no@@ ise was heard af@@ ar off .
and the rest of the nations whom the great and no@@ ble As@@ n@@ app@@ ar brought over , and set in the cities of Samar@@ ia , and the rest that are on this side the river , and at such a time .
be it known now un@@ to the king , that , if this city be buil@@ ded , and the walls set up again , then will they not pay toll , tri@@ bute , and cust@@ om , and so th@@ ou s@@ halt end@@ am@@ age the revenue of the kings .
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar took out of the temp@@ le that was in Jer@@ usalem , and brought them into the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , those did Cy@@ ru@@ s the king take out of the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and they were delivered un@@ to one , whose name was Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar , whom he had made governor ;
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves un@@ to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the he@@ a@@ then of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
and there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jer@@ usalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes , in my real@@ m , which are min@@ ded of their own fre@@ e@@ will to go up to Jer@@ usalem , go with the@@ e .
and all the silver and gold that th@@ ou can@@ st find in all the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the fre@@ e@@ will offering of the people , and of the pri@@ ests , offering will@@ ingly for the house of their God which is in Jer@@ usalem :
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will not do the law of TH@@ Y God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed spe@@ edil@@ y upon him , whether it be un@@ to death , or to ban@@ is@@ hment , or to confis@@ cation of goods , or to imprisonment .
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of our fa@@ thers , which hat@@ h put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to be@@ auti@@ fy the house of the Lord which is in Jer@@ usalem :
then sent I for Eli@@ ez@@ er , for Ari@@ el , for Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Jar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Na@@ than , and for Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and for Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , chief men ; also for Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , men of understanding .
and weighed un@@ to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering of the house of our God , which the king , and his coun@@ sel@@ lers , and his lor@@ ds , and all Israel there present , had offered :
for they have taken of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the hol@@ y se@@ ed have min@@ g@@ led themselves with the people of those lands : ye@@ a , the hand of the pr@@ inces and rul@@ ers hat@@ h been chief in this t@@ res@@ pass .
and Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hi@@ el , one of the sons of E@@ lam , answ@@ ered and said un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra , We have t@@ res@@ passed against our God , and have taken st@@ range wi@@ ves of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
but if ye turn un@@ to me , and keep my comman@@ d@@ ments , and do them ; though there were of you cast out un@@ to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the heav@@ en , yet will I gather them from th@@ ence , and will bring them un@@ to the place that I have chosen to set my name there .
and it came to pass in the month Nisan , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king , that wine was before him : and I took up the wine , and gave it un@@ to the king . now I had not been be@@ fore@@ time sad in his presence .
and I ar@@ ose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jer@@ usalem : neither was there any be@@ ast with me , save the be@@ ast that I ro@@ de upon .
and the rul@@ ers knew not w@@ hi@@ ther I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the pri@@ ests , nor to the no@@ bles , nor to the rul@@ ers , nor to the rest that did the work .
then Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est rose up with his bre@@ th@@ ren the pri@@ ests , and they buil@@ ded the she@@ ep gate ; they sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , and set up the doors of it ; even un@@ to the to@@ wer of Me@@ ah they sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , un@@ to the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el .
but the D@@ ung gate rep@@ aired Mal@@ chi@@ ah the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , the ru@@ ler of part of Beth @@@ -@@ @ h@@ acc@@ er@@ em ; he built it , and set up the doors there@@ of , the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of .
after him rep@@ aired Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ bu@@ k , the ru@@ ler of the half part of Beth @@@ -@@ @ z@@ ur , un@@ to the place over against the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of David , and to the pool that was made , and un@@ to the house of the m@@ igh@@ ty .
but it came to pass , that when San@@ bal@@ lat , and To@@ bi@@ ah , and the Ara@@ bi@@ ans , and the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and the Ash@@ do@@ di@@ tes , heard that the walls of Jer@@ usalem were made up , and that the breaches began to be stopped , then they were very wro@@ th ,
and it came to pass , when our enem@@ ies heard that it was known un@@ to us , and God had brought their coun@@ sel to n@@ ought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one un@@ to his work .
and it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servants w@@ rought in the work , and the other half of them held both the spe@@ ars , the shi@@ elds , and the bo@@ ws , and the haber@@ ge@@ ons ; and the rul@@ ers were behind all the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
they which buil@@ ded on the wall , and they that b@@ are bur@@ den@@ s , with those that la@@ ded , every one with one of his hands w@@ rought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
and th@@ ou h@@ ast also appointed pro@@ ph@@ ets to pre@@ ach of the@@ e at Jer@@ usalem , saying , There is a king in Ju@@ da@@ h : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take coun@@ sel together .
these are the children of the province , that went up out of the cap@@ tivity , of those that had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away , and came again to Jer@@ usalem and to Ju@@ da@@ h , every one un@@ to his city ;
the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , an hundred thirty and eight .
and of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , which took one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te to wife , and was called after their name .
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the por@@ ters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , and all Israel , d@@ wel@@ t in their cities ; and when the seventh month came , the children of Israel were in their cities .
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves bo@@ o@@ ths , every one upon the ro@@ of of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of them that were come again out of the cap@@ tivity made bo@@ o@@ ths , and sat under the bo@@ o@@ ths : for since the days of J@@ es@@ hua the son of nun un@@ to that day had not the children of Israel done so . and there was very great gla@@ d@@ ness .
and she@@ w@@ ed@@ st signs and won@@ ders upon P@@ har@@ o@@ ah , and on all his servants , and on all the people of his land : for th@@ ou k@@ newest that they dealt pro@@ u@@ dly against them . so di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou get the@@ e a name , as it is this day .
and g@@ av@@ est them bread from heav@@ en for their hunger , and b@@ rough@@ test forth water for them out of the rock for their thir@@ st , and promis@@ ed@@ st them that they should go in to poss@@ ess the land which th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st sworn to give them .
yet th@@ ou in TH@@ Y manif@@ old mer@@ cies for@@ so@@ ok@@ est them not in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud depar@@ ted not from them by day , to lead them in the way ; neither the pil@@ lar of fire by night , to she@@ w them light , and the way where@@ in they should go .
for they have not served the@@ e in their k@@ ing@@ dom , and in TH@@ Y great Go@@ od@@ ness that th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est them , and in the large and f@@ at land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est before them , neither turned they from their w@@ ic@@ ked works .
also the fir@@ st@@ born of our sons , and of our c@@ attle , as it is written in the law , and the fir@@ st@@ lings of our her@@ ds and of our f@@ loc@@ ks , to bring to the house of our God , un@@ to the pri@@ ests that minister in the house of our God :
and the pri@@ est the son of Aaron shall be with the L@@ evi@@ tes , when the L@@ evi@@ tes take ti@@ th@@ es : and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall bring up the ti@@ the of the ti@@ th@@ es un@@ to the house of our God , to the ch@@ ambers , into the treasure house .
and at Jer@@ usalem d@@ wel@@ t certain of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h ; Ath@@ ai@@ ah the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Amar@@ i@@ ah , the son of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ hal@@ al@@ e@@ el , of the children of Per@@ ez ;
and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of Bar@@ u@@ ch , the son of Co@@ l @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ z@@ e@@ h , the son of Haz@@ ai@@ ah , the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , the son of Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Sh@@ il@@ oni .
and these are the sons of Benjamin ; Sal@@ lu the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Jo@@ ed , the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , the son of K@@ ola@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , the son of I@@ th@@ i@@ el , the son of J@@ es@@ ai@@ ah .
Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , was the ru@@ ler of the house of God .
and their bre@@ th@@ ren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two : and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Pel@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Am@@ zi , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of P@@ ash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ ah ,
and for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h d@@ wel@@ t at Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba , and in the villages there@@ of , and at Di@@ bon , and in the villages there@@ of , and at J@@ ek@@ ab@@ z@@ e@@ el , and in the villages there@@ of ,
and certain of the pri@@ ests ' sons with tr@@ ump@@ ets ; name@@ ly , Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Jon@@ athan , the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the son of Micha@@ i@@ ah , the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur , the son of A@@ sap@@ h :
and at the fo@@ un@@ tain gate , which was over against them , they went up by the st@@ airs of the city of David , at the going up of the wall , above the house of David , even un@@ to the water gate eas@@ tw@@ ard .
and from above the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el , and the to@@ wer of Me@@ ah , even un@@ to the she@@ ep gate : and they stood still in the prison gate .
on that day they read in the book of Mos@@ es in the audience of the people ; and there@@ in was found written , that the Am@@ mon@@ ite and the Mo@@ abi@@ te should not come into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of God for ever ;
and I conten@@ ded with them , and Cur@@ sed them , and smo@@ te certain of them , and p@@ lu@@ cked off their ha@@ ir , and made them swe@@ ar by God , saying , Y@@ e shall not give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to their sons , nor take their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to your sons , or for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
now it came to pass in the days of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , ( this is Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us which re@@ ig@@ ned , from India even un@@ to Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces : )
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast un@@ to all the people that were present in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace , both un@@ to great and small , seven days , in the court of the gar@@ den of the king 's palace ;
for this de@@ ed of the qu@@ een shall come abroad un@@ to all women , so that they shall desp@@ ise their hus@@ bands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us comman@@ ded V@@ ash@@ ti the qu@@ een to be brought in before him , but she came not .
now it came to pass on the third day , that Es@@ ther put on her royal appar@@ el , and stood in the in@@ ner court of the king 's house , over against the king 's house : and the king sat upon his royal th@@ r@@ one in the royal house , over against the gate of the house .
and it was so , when the king saw Es@@ ther the qu@@ een standing in the court , that she obtained favour in his sight : and the king held out to Es@@ ther the golden scep@@ tre that was in his hand . so Es@@ ther drew near , and touched the top of the scep@@ tre .
and Ham@@ an told them of the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , and the multi@@ tude of his children , and all the things where@@ in the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
and Par@@ sh@@ an@@ da@@ th@@ a , and Dal@@ ph@@ on , and A@@ sp@@ ath@@ a ,
and all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the gre@@ at@@ ness of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , where@@ un@@ to the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Media and Per@@ sia ?
and when they lifted up their eyes af@@ ar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt ; and they rent every one his man@@ tle , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led d@@ ust upon their heads toward heav@@ en .
and it was so , that after the Lord had spoken these words un@@ to Jo@@ b , the Lord said to Eli@@ p@@ haz the Tem@@ an@@ ite , My wr@@ ath is kin@@ d@@ led against the@@ e , and against TH@@ Y two friends : for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my ser@@ vant Jo@@ b hat@@ h .
many , O Lord my God , are TH@@ Y won@@ der@@ ful works which th@@ ou h@@ ast done , and TH@@ Y th@@ ou@@ ghts which are to us @@@ -@@ @ ward : they can@@ not be rec@@ kon@@ ed up in order un@@ to the@@ e : if I would declare and speak of them , they are more than can be num@@ ber@@ ed .
for in@@ num@@ er@@ able ev@@ ils have comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the ha@@ ir@@ s of mine head : therefore my heart fail@@ eth me .
for it was not an enemy that re@@ pro@@ ached me ; then I could have bor@@ ne it : neither was it he that ha@@ ted me that did mag@@ ni@@ fy himself against me ; then I would have hi@@ d myself from him :
b@@ les@@ sed is the man whom th@@ ou choos@@ est , and ca@@ us@@ est to approach un@@ to the@@ e , that he may d@@ well in TH@@ Y courts : we shall be satisfied with the Go@@ od@@ ness of TH@@ Y house , even of TH@@ Y hol@@ y temp@@ le .
for in the hand of the Lord there is a c@@ up , and the wine is red ; it is full of mi@@ x@@ ture ; and he p@@ ou@@ re@@ th out of the same : but the d@@ reg@@ s there@@ of , all the w@@ ic@@ ked of the ear@@ th shall wr@@ ing them out , and drink them .
be@@ hold , as the eyes of servants look un@@ to the hand of their mas@@ ters , and as the eyes of a ma@@ iden un@@ to the hand of her mist@@ ress ; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God , until that he have mer@@ cy upon us .
the way of an e@@ ag@@ le in the air ; the way of a ser@@ p@@ ent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the way of a man with a ma@@ id .
I gathered me also silver and gold , and the pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar treasure of kings and of the provinces : I g@@ at me men singers and women singers , and the deli@@ ghts of the sons of men , as musical instruments , and that of all sor@@ ts .
so I returned , and considered all the op@@ pres@@ sions that are done under the sun : and be@@ hold the te@@ ars of such as were op@@ pressed , and they had no comfor@@ ter ; and on the side of their op@@ pres@@ sors there was power ; but they had no comfor@@ ter .
there is a van@@ ity which is done upon the ear@@ th ; that there be just men , un@@ to whom it happen@@ eth according to the work of the w@@ ic@@ ked ; again , there be w@@ ic@@ ked men , to whom it happen@@ eth according to the work of the righ@@ te@@ ous : I said that this also is van@@ ity .
for man also know@@ eth not his time : as the fis@@ hes that are taken in an ev@@ il net , and as the birds that are caught in the sn@@ are ; so are the sons of men s@@ nar@@ ed in an ev@@ il time , when it fal@@ le@@ th su@@ d@@ den@@ ly upon them .
if the cl@@ ou@@ ds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the ear@@ th : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree fal@@ le@@ th , there it shall be .
as th@@ ou know@@ est not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the b@@ ones do grow in the w@@ om@@ b of her that is with child : even so th@@ ou know@@ est not the works of God who mak@@ eth all .
in the day when the ke@@ epers of the house shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the strong men shall bo@@ w themselves , and the gr@@ in@@ ders ce@@ ase because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be dar@@ ken@@ ed ,
and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the gr@@ in@@ ding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of musi@@ ck shall be brought low ;
look not upon me , because I am black , because the sun hat@@ h looked upon me : my mother 's children were angry with me ; they made me the keep@@ er of the v@@ ine@@ yards ; but mine own v@@ ine@@ yard have I not kept .
O my do@@ ve , that art in the cle@@ fts of the rock , in the secret places of the st@@ airs , let me see TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance , let me hear TH@@ Y voice ; for swe@@ et is TH@@ Y voice , and TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance is co@@ mely .
it was but a little that I passed from them , but I found him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth : I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother 's house , and into the chamber of her that conce@@ ived me .
from the sole of the fo@@ ot even un@@ to the head there is no so@@ und@@ ness in it ; but wounds , and bru@@ ises , and p@@ ut@@ rif@@ ying so@@ res : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither m@@ ol@@ lified with o@@ in@@ tment .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , that the mountain of the Lord 's house shall be established in the top of the mountains , and shall be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and all nations shall flow un@@ to it .
when the Lord shall have was@@ hed away the Fil@@ th of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and shall have p@@ urged the blood of Jer@@ usalem from the mid@@ st there@@ of by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my v@@ ine@@ yard , that I have not done in it ? where@@ fore , when I looked that it should bring forth grap@@ es , brought it forth wild grap@@ es ?
and now go to ; I will tell you what I will do to my v@@ ine@@ yard : I will take away the h@@ edge there@@ of , and it shall be e@@ aten up ; and break down the wall there@@ of , and it shall be tro@@ dden down :
their ro@@ aring shall be like a lion , they shall ro@@ ar like young li@@ ons : ye@@ a , they shall ro@@ ar , and lay hold of the pre@@ y , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
and it came to pass in the days of A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am , the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that Re@@ z@@ in the king of Syria , and Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , king of Israel , went up toward Jer@@ usalem to war against it , but could not prev@@ ail against it .
and it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is conf@@ eder@@ ate with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . and his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall his@@ s for the fly that is in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the be@@ e that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
in the same day shall the Lord s@@ have with a ras@@ or that is hired , name@@ ly , by them beyond the river , by the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , the head , and the ha@@ ir of the feet : and it shall also consum@@ e the be@@ ard .
and on all hil@@ ls that shall be dig@@ ged with the mat@@ to@@ ck , there shall not come th@@ ither the fear of bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns : but it shall be for the sending forth of ox@@ en , and for the t@@ reading of les@@ ser c@@ attle .
and they shall pass through it , hardly bes@@ te@@ ad and hun@@ gry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hun@@ gry , they shall fre@@ t themselves , and cur@@ se their king and their God , and look up@@ ward .
and he shall sn@@ at@@ ch on the right hand , and be hun@@ gry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the f@@ les@@ h of his own arm :
shall the ax@@ e bo@@ ast itself against him that he@@ w@@ eth there@@ with ? or shall the saw mag@@ ni@@ fy itself against him that shak@@ eth it ? as if the ro@@ d should shake itself against them that lift it up , or as if the staff should lift up itself , as if it were no wood .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel , and such as are escaped of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , shall no more again stay upon him that smo@@ te them ; but shall stay upon the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off TH@@ Y sho@@ ul@@ der , and his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k , and the yok@@ e shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting .
but with righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall he judge the poor , and re@@ prove with equ@@ ity for the me@@ ek of the ear@@ th : and he shall sm@@ ite the ear@@ th with the ro@@ d of his m@@ outh , and with the bre@@ ath of his li@@ ps shall he s@@ lay the w@@ ic@@ ked .
for the stars of heav@@ en and the con@@ ste@@ l@@ lations there@@ of shall not give their light : the sun shall be dar@@ ken@@ ed in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to sh@@ ine .
and it shall be as the ch@@ ased ro@@ e , and as a she@@ ep that no man tak@@ eth up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
for the Lord will have mer@@ cy on Jac@@ o@@ b , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land : and the st@@ ran@@ gers shall be joined with them , and they shall cle@@ ave to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give the@@ e rest from TH@@ Y sor@@ row , and from TH@@ Y fear , and from the hard bon@@ da@@ ge where@@ in th@@ ou w@@ ast made to serve ,
that I will break the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an in my land , and upon my mountains tre@@ ad him under fo@@ ot : then shall his yok@@ e de@@ part from off them , and his burden de@@ part from off their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
my heart shall cry out for Mo@@ a@@ b ; his fugitives shall flee un@@ to Zo@@ ar , an he@@ if@@ er of three years old : for by the mounting up of Lu@@ hit@@ h with we@@ eping shall they go it up ; for in the way of Hor@@ on@@ aim they shall raise up a cry of destruction .
in the day s@@ halt th@@ ou make TH@@ Y plant to grow , and in the morning s@@ halt th@@ ou make TH@@ Y se@@ ed to flo@@ ur@@ ish : but the har@@ v@@ est shall be a he@@ ap in the day of gri@@ ef and of desper@@ ate sor@@ row .
for a@@ fore the har@@ v@@ est , when the bu@@ d is perfect , and the s@@ our gra@@ pe is ri@@ pen@@ ing in the f@@ lower , he shall both cut off the sp@@ ri@@ gs with pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks , and take away and cut down the branches .
the burden of Egypt . be@@ hold , the Lord ri@@ de@@ th upon a swift cl@@ oud , and shall come into Egypt : and the id@@ ols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall mel@@ t in the mid@@ st of it .
and the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the mid@@ st there@@ of ; and I will destroy the coun@@ sel there@@ of : and they shall seek to the id@@ ols , and to the char@@ mers , and to them that have familiar spir@@ its , and to the w@@ iz@@ ards .
and I will clo@@ the him with TH@@ Y ro@@ be , and strengthen him with TH@@ Y gir@@ dle , and I will commit TH@@ Y government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and they shall han@@ g upon him all the gl@@ ory of his father 's house , the off@@ spring and the issue , all vessels of small quanti@@ ty , from the vessels of c@@ ups , even to all the vessels of fla@@ g@@ ons .
and it shall come to pass after the end of sev@@ enty years , that the Lord will visit T@@ y@@ re , and she shall turn to her h@@ ire , and shall commit for@@ nic@@ ation with all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world upon the face of the ear@@ th .
and it shall come to pass , that he who fle@@ eth from the no@@ ise of the fear shall fall into the p@@ it ; and he that co@@ me@@ th up out of the mid@@ st of the p@@ it shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for the windows from on high are open , and the foundations of the ear@@ th do shake .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the ear@@ th upon the ear@@ th .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the p@@ it , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
he will sw@@ allow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wi@@ pe away te@@ ars from off all faces ; and the re@@ bu@@ ke of his people shall he take away from off all the ear@@ th : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the mid@@ st of them , as he that swim@@ me@@ th sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th forth his hands to sw@@ im : and he shall bring down their pride together with the sp@@ o@@ ils of their hands .
for he br@@ ing@@ eth down them that d@@ well on high ; the lo@@ f@@ ty city , he lay@@ eth it low ; he lay@@ eth it low , even to the ground ; he br@@ ing@@ eth it even to the d@@ ust .
when the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s there@@ of are with@@ ered , they shall be broken off : the women come , and set them on fire : for it is a people of no understanding : therefore he that made them will not have mer@@ cy on them , and he that formed them will she@@ w them no favour .
then shall he give the rain of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , that th@@ ou s@@ halt so@@ w the ground with@@ al ; and bread of the increase of the ear@@ th , and it shall be f@@ at and plen@@ te@@ ous : in that day shall TH@@ Y c@@ attle fe@@ ed in large pas@@ tures .
Y@@ e shall have a song , as in the night when a hol@@ y so@@ lem@@ n@@ ity is kept ; and gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , as when one go@@ eth with a pip@@ e to come into the mountain of the Lord , to the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Israel .
and the Lord shall cause his g@@ lor@@ ious voice to be heard , and shall she@@ w the ligh@@ ting down of his arm , with the in@@ dign@@ ation of his an@@ ger , and with the fla@@ me of a dev@@ our@@ ing fire , with sc@@ at@@ tering , and temp@@ est , and ha@@ il@@ stones .
Wo@@ e to them that go down to Egypt for help ; and stay on hor@@ ses , and trust in char@@ i@@ ots , because they are many ; and in hor@@ se@@ men , because they are very strong ; but they look not un@@ to the Holy One of Israel , neither seek the Lord !
and all the host of heav@@ en shall be dis@@ solved , and the heav@@ ens shall be rol@@ led together as a s@@ cr@@ oll : and all their host shall fall down , as the le@@ af fal@@ le@@ th off from the v@@ ine , and as a falling fi@@ g from the fi@@ g tree .
the wild be@@ asts of the de@@ sert shall also meet with the wild be@@ asts of the island , and the sat@@ y@@ r shall cry to his fellow ; the scre@@ ech ow@@ l also shall rest there , and find for her@@ self a place of rest .
now therefore give pledges , I pra@@ y the@@ e , to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give the@@ e two thousand hor@@ ses , if th@@ ou be able on TH@@ Y part to set ri@@ ders upon them .
H@@ ast th@@ ou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be to lay waste def@@ enced cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded : they were as the gr@@ ass of the field , and as the green her@@ b , as the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and as cor@@ n b@@ lasted before it be grown up .
because TH@@ Y ra@@ ge against me , and TH@@ Y t@@ um@@ ult , is come up into mine e@@ ars , therefore will I put my ho@@ ok in TH@@ Y n@@ ose , and my bri@@ dle in TH@@ Y li@@ ps , and I will turn the@@ e back by the way by which th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st .
then the an@@ gel of the Lord went forth , and smo@@ te in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans a hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score and five thousand : and when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , they were all dead cor@@ p@@ ses .
and it came to pass , as he was wor@@ shipping in the house of Nis@@ ro@@ ch his go@@ d , that Ad@@ ram@@ me@@ le@@ ch and Shar@@ ez@@ er his sons smo@@ te him with the s@@ word ; and they escaped into the land of Armenia : and E@@ sar @@@ -@@ @ h@@ add@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
mine age is depar@@ ted , and is removed from me as a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's tent : I have cut off like a we@@ av@@ er my life : he will cut me off with p@@ ining si@@ ck@@ ness : from day even to night w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou make an end of me .
who hat@@ h meas@@ ured the waters in the hol@@ low of his hand , and me@@ ted out heav@@ en with the sp@@ an , and compre@@ hen@@ ded the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scal@@ es , and the hil@@ ls in a balance ?
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt seek them , and s@@ halt not find them , even them that conten@@ ded with the@@ e : they that war against the@@ e shall be as nothing , and as a thing of n@@ ought .
who hat@@ h declared from the beginning , that we may know ? and be@@ fore@@ time , that we may say , He is righ@@ te@@ ous ? ye@@ a , there is none that she@@ w@@ eth , ye@@ a , there is none that declar@@ eth , ye@@ a , there is none that he@@ aret@@ h your words .
thus sa@@ ith God the Lord , he that created the heav@@ ens , and stret@@ ched them out ; he that spread forth the ear@@ th , and that which co@@ me@@ th out of it ; he that gi@@ vet@@ h bre@@ ath un@@ to the people upon it , and spirit to them that walk there@@ in :
therefore he hat@@ h p@@ oured upon him the fur@@ y of his an@@ ger , and the strength of battle : and it hat@@ h set him on fire round about , yet he knew not ; and it burned him , yet he laid it not to heart .
when th@@ ou pass@@ est through the waters , I will be with the@@ e ; and through the rivers , they shall not over@@ flow the@@ e : when th@@ ou walk@@ est through the fire , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be burned ; neither shall the fla@@ me kin@@ dle upon the@@ e .
they bear him upon the sho@@ ul@@ der , they carry him , and set him in his place , and he stan@@ de@@ th ; from his place shall he not remove : ye@@ a , one shall cry un@@ to him , yet can he not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
hear ye this , O house of Jac@@ o@@ b , which are called by the name of Israel , and are come forth out of the waters of Ju@@ da@@ h , which swe@@ ar by the name of the Lord , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth , nor in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
and kings shall be TH@@ Y nur@@ sing fa@@ thers , and their que@@ ens TH@@ Y nur@@ sing mothers : they shall bo@@ w down to the@@ e with their face toward the ear@@ th , and lick up the d@@ ust of TH@@ Y feet ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord : for they shall not be as@@ ha@@ med that wait for me .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , W@@ here is the bill of your mother 's div@@ or@@ cement , whom I have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? be@@ hold , for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have ye sold yo@@ ur@@ selves , and for your trans@@ gres@@ sions is your mother put away .
the Lord God hat@@ h given me the ton@@ gue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is we@@ ary : he w@@ aken@@ eth morning by morning , he w@@ aken@@ eth mine e@@ ar to hear as the learned .
for the Lord shall comfor@@ t Z@@ ion : he will comfor@@ t all her waste places ; and he will make her w@@ il@@ der@@ ness like E@@ den , and her de@@ sert like the gar@@ den of the Lord ; joy and gla@@ d@@ ness shall be found there@@ in , Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , and the voice of me@@ lo@@ dy .
thus sa@@ ith TH@@ Y Lord the Lord , and TH@@ Y God that ple@@ ade@@ th the cause of his people , be@@ hold , I have taken out of th@@ ine hand the c@@ up of tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , even the d@@ reg@@ s of the c@@ up of my fur@@ y ; th@@ ou s@@ halt no more drink it again :
but I will put it into the hand of them that aff@@ lic@@ t the@@ e ; which have said to TH@@ Y sou@@ l , bo@@ w down , that we may go over : and th@@ ou h@@ ast laid TH@@ Y body as the ground , and as the street , to them that went over .
fear not ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt not be as@@ ha@@ med : neither be th@@ ou con@@ founded ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt not be put to sh@@ ame : for th@@ ou s@@ halt forget the sh@@ ame of TH@@ Y youth , and s@@ halt not remember the re@@ pro@@ ach of TH@@ Y wi@@ do@@ who@@ od any more .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore do ye spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labour for that which satis@@ fi@@ eth not ? he@@ arken dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to me , and eat ye that which is good , and let your sou@@ l de@@ light itself in fat@@ ness .
for as the rain co@@ me@@ th down , and the snow from heav@@ en , and retur@@ net@@ h not th@@ ither , but water@@ eth the ear@@ th , and mak@@ eth it bring forth and bu@@ d , that it may give se@@ ed to the so@@ wer , and bread to the e@@ ater :
for thus sa@@ ith the high and lo@@ f@@ ty One that inhabi@@ te@@ th et@@ ern@@ ity , whose name is Holy ; I d@@ well in the high and hol@@ y place , with him also that is of a contr@@ ite and hum@@ ble spirit , to revive the spirit of the hum@@ ble , and to revive the heart of the contr@@ ite ones .
be@@ hold , ye fast for stri@@ fe and debate , and to sm@@ ite with the f@@ ist of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
is it not to deal TH@@ Y bread to the hun@@ gry , and that th@@ ou bring the poor that are cast out to TH@@ Y house ? when th@@ ou se@@ est the nak@@ ed , that th@@ ou cover him ; and that th@@ ou hide not th@@ y@@ self from th@@ ine own f@@ les@@ h ?
as for me , this is my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , sa@@ ith the Lord ; My spirit that is upon the@@ e , and my words which I have put in TH@@ Y m@@ outh , shall not de@@ part out of TH@@ Y m@@ outh , nor out of the m@@ outh of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , nor out of the m@@ outh of TH@@ Y se@@ ed 's se@@ ed , sa@@ ith the Lord , from hen@@ ce@@ forth and for ever .
the sons also of them that aff@@ lic@@ ted the@@ e shall come ben@@ ding un@@ to the@@ e ; and all they that desp@@ ised the@@ e shall bo@@ w themselves down at the so@@ les of TH@@ Y feet ; and they shall call the@@ e , The city of the Lord , The Z@@ ion of the Holy One of Israel .
but ye shall be named the pri@@ ests of the Lord : men shall call you the Ministers of our God : ye shall eat the ri@@ ches of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and in their gl@@ ory shall ye bo@@ ast yo@@ ur@@ selves .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness there@@ of go forth as bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , and the sal@@ vation there@@ of as a lam@@ p that bur@@ net@@ h .
the Lord hat@@ h sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , su@@ rely I will no more give TH@@ Y cor@@ n to be meat for th@@ ine enem@@ ies ; and the sons of the st@@ ran@@ ger shall not drink TH@@ Y wine , for the which th@@ ou h@@ ast la@@ b@@ oured :
I will mention the lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ nesses of the Lord , and the pra@@ ises of the Lord , according to all that the Lord hat@@ h bes@@ to@@ wed on us , and the great Go@@ od@@ ness toward the house of Israel , which he hat@@ h bes@@ to@@ wed on them according to his mer@@ cies , and according to the multi@@ tude of his lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ nesses .
and I saw , when for all the causes where@@ by back@@ sli@@ ding Israel committed ad@@ ul@@ tery I had put her away , and given her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce ; yet her t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous sister Ju@@ da@@ h fear@@ ed not , but went and played the har@@ lot also .
run ye to and f@@ ro through the streets of Jer@@ usalem , and see now , and know , and seek in the broad places there@@ of , if ye can find a man , if there be any that execu@@ te@@ th judgment , that seek@@ eth the truth ; and I will par@@ don it .
I will get me un@@ to the great men , and will speak un@@ to them ; for they have known the way of the Lord , and the judgment of their God : but these have altogether broken the yok@@ e , and bur@@ st the bonds .
and they shall eat up th@@ ine har@@ v@@ est , and TH@@ Y bread , which TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters should eat : they shall eat up TH@@ Y f@@ loc@@ ks and th@@ ine her@@ ds : they shall eat up TH@@ Y v@@ ines and TH@@ Y fi@@ g trees : they shall imp@@ over@@ ish TH@@ Y f@@ enced cities , where@@ in th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ ted@@ st , with the s@@ word .
they are wa@@ x@@ en f@@ at , they sh@@ ine : ye@@ a , they over@@ pass the de@@ eds of the w@@ ic@@ ked : they judge not the cause , the cause of the fa@@ ther@@ less , yet they prosp@@ er ; and the right of the ne@@ edy do they not judge .
to whom shall I speak , and give warning , that they may hear ? be@@ hold , their e@@ ar is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and they can@@ not he@@ arken : be@@ hold , the word of the Lord is un@@ to them a re@@ pro@@ ach ; they have no de@@ light in it .
and now , because ye have done all these works , sa@@ ith the Lord , and I sp@@ ake un@@ to you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answ@@ ered not ;
but this thing comman@@ ded I them , saying , obe@@ y my voice , and I will be your God , and ye shall be my people : and walk ye in all the ways that I have comman@@ ded you , that it may be well un@@ to you .
since the day that your fa@@ thers came forth out of the land of Egypt un@@ to this day I have even sent un@@ to you all my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , daily rising up early and sending them :
then will I cause to ce@@ ase from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the streets of Jer@@ usalem , the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de : for the land shall be de@@ so@@ late .
at that time , sa@@ ith the Lord , they shall bring out the b@@ ones of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the b@@ ones of his pr@@ inces , and the b@@ ones of the pri@@ ests , and the b@@ ones of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the b@@ ones of the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , out of their graves :
therefore will I give their wi@@ ves un@@ to others , and their fields to them that shall inher@@ it them : for every one from the least even un@@ to the greatest is given to c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness , from the pro@@ phe@@ t even un@@ to the pri@@ est every one deal@@ eth fal@@ sely .
silver spread into plates is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from U@@ p@@ haz , the work of the work@@ man , and of the hands of the founder : blue and pur@@ ple is their clo@@ thing : they are all the work of c@@ un@@ ning men .
when he ut@@ ter@@ eth his voice , there is a multi@@ tude of waters in the heav@@ ens , and he ca@@ us@@ eth the v@@ ap@@ ours to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he mak@@ eth ligh@@ t@@ nings with rain , and br@@ ing@@ eth forth the wind out of his treasures .
my tab@@ ern@@ acle is sp@@ o@@ iled , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my cur@@ tains .
for I ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly protested un@@ to your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , even un@@ to this day , rising early and protesting , saying , obe@@ y my voice .
they are turned back to the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fore@@ fa@@ thers , which refused to hear my words ; and they went after other go@@ ds to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I made with their fa@@ thers .
for even TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , and the house of TH@@ Y father , even they have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with the@@ e ; ye@@ a , they have called a multi@@ tude after the@@ e : believe them not , though they speak fair words un@@ to the@@ e .
the sp@@ o@@ ilers are come upon all high places through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : for the s@@ word of the Lord shall dev@@ our from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no f@@ les@@ h shall have peace .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord against all mine ev@@ il neighbours , that touch the inher@@ it@@ ance which I have caused my people Israel to inher@@ it ; be@@ hold , I will p@@ lu@@ ck them out of their land , and p@@ lu@@ ck out the house of Ju@@ da@@ h from among them .
and it shall come to pass , after that I have p@@ lu@@ cked them out I will return , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on them , and will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
give gl@@ ory to the Lord your God , before he cause d@@ ark@@ ness , and before your feet st@@ um@@ ble upon the dark mountains , and , while ye look for light , he turn it into the shadow of death , and make it gross d@@ ark@@ ness .
and the people to whom they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y shall be cast out in the streets of Jer@@ usalem because of the fam@@ ine and the s@@ word ; and they shall have none to bur@@ y them , them , their wi@@ ves , nor their sons , nor their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : for I will p@@ our their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess upon them .
their wi@@ dows are increased to me above the s@@ and of the seas : I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a sp@@ o@@ iler at no@@ on@@ day : I have caused him to fall upon it su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , and terr@@ ors upon the city .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that b@@ are them , and concerning their fa@@ thers that beg@@ at them in this land ;
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; be@@ hold , I will cause to ce@@ ase out of this place in your eyes , and in your days , the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de .
and it shall come to pass , when th@@ ou s@@ halt she@@ w this people all these words , and they shall say un@@ to the@@ e , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore hat@@ h the Lord pronounced all this great ev@@ il against us ? or what is our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God ?
and th@@ ou , even th@@ y@@ self , s@@ halt dis@@ continue from th@@ ine heritage that I gave the@@ e ; and I will cause the@@ e to serve th@@ ine enem@@ ies in the land which th@@ ou know@@ est not : for ye have kin@@ d@@ led a fire in mine an@@ ger , which shall bur@@ n for ever .
and it shall come to pass , if ye dil@@ ig@@ ently he@@ arken un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , but hal@@ low the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , to do no work there@@ in ;
and they shall come from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the places about Jer@@ usalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the pla@@ in , and from the mountains , and from the south , bringing bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and meat offer@@ ings , and incen@@ se , and bringing sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of praise , un@@ to the house of the Lord .
therefore deliver up their children to the fam@@ ine , and p@@ our out their blood by the force of the s@@ word ; and let their wi@@ ves be ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed of their children , and be wi@@ dows ; and let their men be put to death ; let their young men be sla@@ in by the s@@ word in battle .
and I will make vo@@ id the coun@@ sel of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the s@@ word before their enem@@ ies , and by the hands of them that seek their lives : and their car@@ cases will I give to be meat for the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , and for the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
and I will cause them to eat the f@@ les@@ h of their sons and the f@@ les@@ h of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and they shall eat every one the f@@ les@@ h of his friend in the siege and stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with their enem@@ ies , and they that seek their lives , shall stra@@ i@@ ten them .
and the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and the houses of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , shall be def@@ iled as the place of Top@@ he@@ t , because of all the houses upon whose ro@@ of@@ s they have burned incen@@ se un@@ to all the host of heav@@ en , and have p@@ oured out drink offer@@ ings un@@ to other go@@ ds .
moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city , and all the la@@ bour@@ s there@@ of , and all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things there@@ of , and all the treasures of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies , which shall sp@@ oil them , and take them , and carry them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
he that abi@@ de@@ th in this city shall die by the s@@ word , and by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce : but he that go@@ eth out , and fal@@ le@@ th to the Chal@@ de@@ ans that bes@@ i@@ ege you , he shall live , and his life shall be un@@ to him for a pre@@ y .
and I will give the@@ e into the hand of them that seek TH@@ Y life , and into the hand of them whose face th@@ ou fear@@ est , even into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
but if they had stood in my coun@@ sel , and had caused my people to hear my words , then they should have turned them from their ev@@ il way , and from the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
therefore , be@@ hold , I , even I , will ut@@ ter@@ ly forget you , and I will for@@ sake you , and the city that I gave you and your fa@@ thers , and cast you out of my presence :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel ; L@@ ike these good fig@@ s , so will I acknowledge them that are carried away cap@@ tive of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans for their good .
for I will set mine eyes upon them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not p@@ lu@@ ck them up .
from the thir@@ teen@@ th year of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on king of Ju@@ da@@ h , even un@@ to this day , that is the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , the word of the Lord hat@@ h come un@@ to me , and I have spoken un@@ to you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed .
moreover I will take from them the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de , the sound of the mil@@ l@@ stones , and the light of the cand@@ le .
to w@@ it , Jer@@ usalem , and the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the kings there@@ of , and the pr@@ inces there@@ of , to make them a de@@ so@@ lation , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , an his@@ sing , and a cur@@ se ; as it is this day ;
and all the min@@ g@@ led people , and all the kings of the land of U@@ z , and all the kings of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and Az@@ z@@ ah , and E@@ kr@@ on , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , which are upon the face of the ear@@ th : and the king of Sh@@ es@@ h@@ ach shall drink after them .
and the sla@@ in of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the ear@@ th even un@@ to the other end of the ear@@ th : they shall not be lamen@@ ted , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be D@@ ung upon the ground .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; St@@ and in the court of the Lord 's house , and speak un@@ to all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , which come to worship in the Lord 's house , all the words that I command the@@ e to speak un@@ to them ; dimin@@ ish not a word :
now it came to pass , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had comman@@ ded him to speak un@@ to all the people , that the pri@@ ests and the pro@@ ph@@ ets and all the people took him , saying , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely die .
when the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h heard these things , then they came up from the king 's house un@@ to the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house .
and when Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , with all his m@@ igh@@ ty men , and all the pr@@ inces , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death : but when U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt ;
and send them to the king of E@@ dom , and to the king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and to the king of the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and to the king of T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and to the king of Z@@ id@@ on , by the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers which come to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and it came to pass the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the fourth year , and in the fifth month , that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ ur the pro@@ phe@@ t , which was of Gi@@ be@@ on , sp@@ ake un@@ to me in the house of the Lord , in the presence of the pri@@ ests and of all the people , saying ,
know that thus sa@@ ith the Lord of the king that sit@@ te@@ th upon the th@@ r@@ one of David , and of all the people that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in this city , and of your bre@@ th@@ ren that are not gone forth with you into cap@@ tivity ;
the Lord hat@@ h made the@@ e pri@@ est in the stead of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est , that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord , for every man that is ma@@ d , and mak@@ eth himself a pro@@ phe@@ t , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest put him in prison , and in the sto@@ cks .
all TH@@ Y lov@@ ers have forgotten the@@ e ; they seek the@@ e not ; for I have wounded the@@ e with the wo@@ und of an enemy , with the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of a cru@@ el one , for the multi@@ tude of th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; because TH@@ Y sin@@ s were increased .
therefore all they that dev@@ our the@@ e shall be dev@@ oured ; and all th@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ aries , every one of them , shall go into cap@@ tivity ; and they that sp@@ oil the@@ e shall be a sp@@ oil , and all that pre@@ y upon the@@ e will I give for a pre@@ y .
and out of them shall proceed Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving and the voice of them that make mer@@ ry : and I will multi@@ ply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also g@@ lor@@ ify them , and they shall not be small .
su@@ rely after that I was turned , I re@@ pen@@ ted ; and after that I was instruc@@ ted , I smo@@ te upon my th@@ igh : I was as@@ ha@@ med , ye@@ a , even con@@ founded , because I did bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of my youth .
and it shall come to pass , that like as I have watched over them , to p@@ lu@@ ck up , and to break down , and to throw down , and to destroy , and to aff@@ lic@@ t ; so will I watch over them , to build , and to plant , sa@@ ith the Lord .
not according to the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I made with their fa@@ thers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant they br@@ ake , although I was an husband un@@ to them , sa@@ ith the Lord :
and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h shall not escape out of the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , but shall su@@ rely be delivered into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and shall speak with him m@@ outh to m@@ outh , and his eyes shall be@@ hold his eyes ;
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; T@@ ake these evi@@ den@@ ces , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an ear@@ then ves@@ sel , that they may continue many days .
for this city hat@@ h been to me as a provoc@@ ation of mine an@@ ger and of my fur@@ y from the day that they built it even un@@ to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
be@@ hold , I will gather them out of all countries , w@@ hi@@ ther I have driven them in mine an@@ ger , and in my fur@@ y , and in great wr@@ ath ; and I will bring them again un@@ to this place , and I will cause them to d@@ well saf@@ ely :
and I will make an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hear@@ ts , that they shall not de@@ part from me .
and I will cleans@@ e them from all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , where@@ by they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will par@@ don all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , where@@ by they have sin@@ ned , and where@@ by they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
in the cities of the mountains , in the cities of the val@@ e , and in the cities of the south , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jer@@ usalem , and in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , shall the f@@ loc@@ ks pass again under the hands of him that tel@@ le@@ th them , sa@@ ith the Lord .
the word which came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and all his army , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th of his domin@@ ion , and all the people , fought against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities there@@ of , saying ,
at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , which hat@@ h been sold un@@ to the@@ e ; and when he hat@@ h served the@@ e six years , th@@ ou s@@ halt let him go free from the@@ e : but your fa@@ thers hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to me , neither inc@@ lined their e@@ ar .
but ye turned and pollu@@ ted my name , and caused every man his ser@@ vant , and every man his hand@@ ma@@ id , whom ye had set at liber@@ ty at their pleas@@ ure , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection , to be un@@ to you for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , and to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h and his pr@@ inces will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army , which are gone up from you .
but it came to pass , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came up into the land , that we said , C@@ ome , and let us go to Jer@@ usalem for fear of the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and for fear of the army of the Syri@@ ans : so we d@@ well at Jer@@ usalem .
take the@@ e a rol@@ l of a book , and write there@@ in all the words that I have spoken un@@ to the@@ e against Israel , and against Ju@@ da@@ h , and against all the nations , from the day I sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , from the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah , even un@@ to this day .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah called Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah : and Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote from the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken un@@ to him , upon a rol@@ l of a book .
therefore go th@@ ou , and read in the rol@@ l , which th@@ ou h@@ ast written from my m@@ outh , the words of the Lord in the e@@ ars of the people in the Lord 's house upon the fas@@ ting day : and also th@@ ou s@@ halt read them in the e@@ ars of all Ju@@ da@@ h that come out of their cities .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the ninth month , that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jer@@ usalem , and to all the people that came from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h un@@ to Jer@@ usalem .
then read Bar@@ u@@ ch in the book the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house , in the e@@ ars of all the people .
then he went down into the king 's house , into the s@@ cri@@ be 's chamber : and , lo , all the pr@@ inces sat there , even E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be , and De@@ la@@ i@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and El@@ na@@ than the son of A@@ ch@@ bor , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and all the pr@@ inces .
therefore all the pr@@ inces sent J@@ eh@@ udi the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah , the son of C@@ us@@ hi , un@@ to Bar@@ u@@ ch , saying , T@@ ake in th@@ ine hand the rol@@ l where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast read in the e@@ ars of the people , and come . so Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah took the rol@@ l in his hand , and came un@@ to them .
so the king sent J@@ eh@@ udi to f@@ et@@ ch the rol@@ l : and he took it out of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be 's chamber . and J@@ eh@@ udi read it in the e@@ ars of the king , and in the e@@ ars of all the pr@@ inces which stood bes@@ ide the king .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; He shall have none to sit upon the th@@ r@@ one of David : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the F@@ ro@@ st .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel ; Th@@ us shall ye say to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that sent you un@@ to me to inqu@@ ire of me ; be@@ hold , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the pr@@ inces were wro@@ th with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and smo@@ te him , and put him in prison in the house of Jon@@ athan the s@@ cri@@ be : for they had made that the prison .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , He that remain@@ eth in this city shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce : but he that go@@ eth forth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans shall live ; for he shall have his life for a pre@@ y , and shall live .
then took they Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and cast him into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on of Mal@@ chi@@ ah the son of Ham@@ me@@ le@@ ch , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jerem@@ i@@ ah with cor@@ ds . and in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on there was no water , but m@@ ire : so Jerem@@ i@@ ah sun@@ k in the m@@ ire .
now when E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ me@@ le@@ ch the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian , one of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s which was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ;
my lor@@ d the king , these men have done ev@@ il in all that they have done to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , whom they have cast into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is : for there is no more bread in the city .
but if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not go forth to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's pr@@ inces , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they shall bur@@ n it with fire , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not escape out of their hand .
so they shall bring out all TH@@ Y wi@@ ves and TH@@ Y children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans : and th@@ ou s@@ halt not escape out of their hand , but s@@ halt be taken by the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and th@@ ou s@@ halt cause this city to be burned with fire .
but if the pr@@ inces hear that I have talked with the@@ e , and they come un@@ to the@@ e , and say un@@ to the@@ e , declare un@@ to us now what th@@ ou h@@ ast said un@@ to the king , hide it not from us , and we will not put the@@ e to death ; also what the king said un@@ to the@@ e :
and it came to pass , that when Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king of Ju@@ da@@ h saw them , and all the men of war , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's gar@@ den , by the gate bet@@ wi@@ xt the two walls : and he went out the way of the pla@@ in .
but the Chal@@ de@@ ans ' army pursu@@ ed after them , and over@@ took Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , where he gave judgment upon him .
then Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive into Bab@@ yl@@ on the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
but Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and gave them v@@ ine@@ yards and fields at the same time .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , after that Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ram@@ ah , when he had taken him being bound in cha@@ ins among all that were carried away cap@@ tive of Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , which were carried away cap@@ tive un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now when all the cap@@ tains of the forces which were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am governor in the land , and had committed un@@ to him men , and women , and children , and of the poor of the land , of them that were not carried away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
then they came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , even I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and Johan@@ an and Jon@@ athan the sons of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th , and the sons of Ep@@ hai the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and J@@ ez@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of a Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , they and their men .
as for me , be@@ hold , I will d@@ well at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to serve the Chal@@ de@@ ans , which will come un@@ to us : but ye , gather ye wine , and summer fru@@ its , and oil , and put them in your vessels , and d@@ well in your cities that ye have taken .
likewise when all the Jews that were in Mo@@ a@@ b , and among the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and in E@@ dom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left a re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , and that he had set over them G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an ;
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the se@@ ed royal , and the pr@@ inces of the king , even ten men with him , came un@@ to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ; and there they did eat bread together in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
then ar@@ ose I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and the ten men that were with him , and smo@@ te G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an with the s@@ word , and sle@@ w him , whom the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made governor over the land .
and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said un@@ to them , C@@ ome to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
and it was so , when they came into the mid@@ st of the city , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah sle@@ w them , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the p@@ it , he , and the men that were with him .
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el saw Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t said un@@ to them , I have heard you ; be@@ hold , I will pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord your God according to your words ; and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever thing the Lord shall answer you , I will declare it un@@ to you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
if ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not p@@ lu@@ ck you up : for I rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il that I have done un@@ to you .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we d@@ well :
then it shall come to pass , that the s@@ word , which ye fear@@ ed , shall over@@ take you there in the land of Egypt , and the fam@@ ine , where@@ of ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to so@@ jour@@ n there ; they shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce : and none of them shall remain or escape from the ev@@ il that I will bring upon them .
for ye dis@@ sem@@ b@@ led in your hear@@ ts , when ye sent me un@@ to the Lord your God , saying , pra@@ y for us un@@ to the Lord our God ; and according un@@ to all that the Lord our God shall say , so declare un@@ to us , and we will do it .
and now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you .
and it came to pass , that when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking un@@ to all the people all the words of the Lord their God , for which the Lord their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , that were returned from all nations , w@@ hi@@ ther they had been driven , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the Jews which d@@ well in the land of Egypt , which d@@ well at Mig@@ dol , and at Tah@@ pan@@ hes , and at N@@ op@@ h , and in the country of P@@ ath@@ ros , saying ,
have ye forgotten the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your fa@@ thers , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their wi@@ ves , and your own w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your wi@@ ves , which they have committed in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ?
then all the men which knew that their wi@@ ves had burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , and all the women that stood by , a great multi@@ tude , even all the people that d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Egypt , in P@@ ath@@ ros , answ@@ ered Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
so that the Lord could no longer bear , because of the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings , and because of the ab@@ omin@@ ations which ye have committed ; therefore is your land a de@@ so@@ lation , and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , and a cur@@ se , without an inhabi@@ tant , as at this day .
be@@ hold , I will watch over them for ev@@ il , and not for good : and all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h that are in the land of Egypt shall be consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine , until there be an end of them .
the word that Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t sp@@ ake un@@ to Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah , when he had written these words in a book at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
he made many to fall , ye@@ a , one fell upon another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our nati@@ vity , from the op@@ pressing s@@ word .
also her hired men are in the mid@@ st of her like fat@@ ted bul@@ loc@@ ks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity was come upon them , and the time of their vis@@ itation .
and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of his servants : and after@@ ward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , sa@@ ith the Lord .
but fear not th@@ ou , O my ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b , and be not dis@@ may@@ ed , O Israel : for , be@@ hold , I will save the@@ e from af@@ ar off , and TH@@ Y se@@ ed from the land of their cap@@ tivity ; and Jac@@ o@@ b shall return , and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the no@@ ise of the st@@ amp@@ ing of the ho@@ of@@ s of his strong hor@@ ses , at the rus@@ hing of his char@@ i@@ ots , and at the r@@ umb@@ ling of his whe@@ els , the fa@@ thers shall not look back to their children for fe@@ eb@@ len@@ ess of hands ;
he that fle@@ eth from the fear shall fall into the p@@ it ; and he that get@@ te@@ th up out of the p@@ it shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for I will bring upon it , even upon Mo@@ a@@ b , the year of their vis@@ itation , sa@@ ith the Lord .
they that fled stood under the shadow of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon because of the force : but a fire shall come forth out of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and a fla@@ me from the mid@@ st of S@@ ih@@ on , and shall dev@@ our the cor@@ ner of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the cro@@ wn of the head of the t@@ um@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous ones .
therefore hear the coun@@ sel of the Lord , that he hat@@ h taken against E@@ dom ; and his purposes , that he hat@@ h pur@@ posed against the inhabitants of Tem@@ an : su@@ rely the least of the flock shall draw them out : su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tations de@@ so@@ late with them .
cut off the so@@ wer from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and him that hand@@ le@@ th the si@@ ck@@ le in the time of har@@ v@@ est : for fear of the op@@ pressing s@@ word they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
a s@@ word is upon their hor@@ ses , and upon their char@@ i@@ ots , and upon all the min@@ g@@ led people that are in the mid@@ st of her ; and they shall become as women : a s@@ word is upon her treasures ; and they shall be ro@@ bbed .
therefore the wild be@@ asts of the de@@ sert with the wild be@@ asts of the islands shall d@@ well there , and the ow@@ ls shall d@@ well there@@ in : and it shall be no more inhabited for ever ; neither shall it be d@@ wel@@ t in from generation to generation .
therefore hear ye the coun@@ sel of the Lord , that he hat@@ h taken against Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and his purposes , that he hat@@ h pur@@ posed against the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans : su@@ rely the least of the flock shall draw them out : su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late with them .
against him that ben@@ de@@ th let the ar@@ cher b@@ end his bo@@ w , and against him that lif@@ te@@ th himself up in his bri@@ g@@ and@@ ine : and spar@@ e ye not her young men ; destroy ye ut@@ ter@@ ly all her host .
make bright the ar@@ ro@@ ws ; gather the shi@@ elds : the Lord hat@@ h raised up the spirit of the kings of the Me@@ des : for his device is against Bab@@ yl@@ on , to destroy it ; because it is the ven@@ ge@@ ance of the Lord , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
when he ut@@ ter@@ eth his voice , there is a multi@@ tude of waters in the heav@@ ens ; and he ca@@ us@@ eth the v@@ ap@@ ours to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th : he mak@@ eth ligh@@ t@@ nings with rain , and br@@ ing@@ eth forth the wind out of his treasures .
with the@@ e also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces old and young ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the young man and the ma@@ id ;
I will also break in pieces with the@@ e the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d and his flock ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the hus@@ b@@ and@@ man and his yok@@ e of ox@@ en ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces cap@@ tains and rul@@ ers .
and I will punish B@@ el in Bab@@ yl@@ on , and I will bring forth out of his m@@ outh that which he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up : and the nations shall not flow together any more un@@ to him : ye@@ a , the wall of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall fall .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the Gra@@ ven images of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and her whole land shall be con@@ founded , and all her sla@@ in shall fall in the mid@@ st of her .
and it shall be , when th@@ ou h@@ ast made an end of reading this book , that th@@ ou s@@ halt bin@@ d a stone to it , and cast it into the mid@@ st of E@@ up@@ h@@ rates :
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he and all his army , against Jer@@ usalem , and pit@@ ched against it , and built for@@ ts against it round about .
then he put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah ; and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on bound him in cha@@ ins , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put him in prison ti@@ ll the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan , captain of the guard , which served the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , into Jer@@ usalem ,
then Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive certain of the poor of the people , and the resi@@ due of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the rest of the multi@@ tude .
also the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the br@@ as@@ en sea that was in the house of the Lord , the Chal@@ de@@ ans br@@ ake , and carried all the br@@ ass of them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the bas@@ ons , and the fi@@ rep@@ ans , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the cal@@ dr@@ ons , and the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the c@@ ups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the Jews seven hundred for@@ ty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his di@@ et , there was a contin@@ ual di@@ et given him of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
the yok@@ e of my trans@@ gres@@ sions is bound by his hand : they are w@@ re@@ ath@@ ed , and come up upon my nec@@ k : he hat@@ h made my strength to fall , the Lord hat@@ h delivered me into their hands , from whom I am not able to rise up .
the Lord hat@@ h tro@@ dden under fo@@ ot all my m@@ igh@@ ty men in the mid@@ st of me : he hat@@ h called an assembly against me to cr@@ ush my young men : the Lord hat@@ h tro@@ dden the vir@@ gin , the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h , as in a win@@ e@@ press .
how hat@@ h the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cl@@ oud in his an@@ ger , and cast down from heav@@ en un@@ to the ear@@ th the beauty of Israel , and remember@@ ed not his foot@@ st@@ ool in the day of his an@@ ger !
the Lord hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up all the habi@@ tations of Jac@@ o@@ b , and hat@@ h not p@@ iti@@ ed : he hat@@ h thrown down in his wr@@ ath the strong holds of the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h ; he hat@@ h brought them down to the ground : he hat@@ h pollu@@ ted the k@@ ing@@ dom and the pr@@ inces there@@ of .
the Lord hat@@ h cast off his alt@@ ar , he hat@@ h ab@@ hor@@ red his sanc@@ tu@@ ary , he hat@@ h given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her pal@@ aces ; they have made a no@@ ise in the house of the Lord , as in the day of a so@@ lem@@ n feast .
the el@@ ders of the daughter of Z@@ ion sit upon the ground , and keep sil@@ ence : they have cast up d@@ ust upon their heads ; they have gir@@ ded themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th : the vir@@ g@@ ins of Jer@@ usalem han@@ g down their heads to the ground .
mine eyes do fail with te@@ ars , my bo@@ wel@@ s are troubled , my li@@ ver is p@@ oured upon the ear@@ th , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the su@@ ck@@ lings s@@ wo@@ on in the streets of the city .
the Lord hat@@ h done that which he had dev@@ ised ; he hat@@ h fulfilled his word that he had comman@@ ded in the days of old : he hat@@ h thrown down , and hat@@ h not p@@ iti@@ ed : and he hat@@ h caused th@@ ine enemy to re@@ jo@@ ice over the@@ e , he hat@@ h set up the Hor@@ n of th@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ aries .
arise , cry out in the night : in the beginning of the wat@@ ches p@@ our out th@@ ine heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up TH@@ Y hands toward him for the life of TH@@ Y young children , that fa@@ int for hunger in the top of every street .
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my vir@@ g@@ ins and my young men are fallen by the s@@ word ; th@@ ou h@@ ast sla@@ in them in the day of th@@ ine an@@ ger ; th@@ ou h@@ ast killed , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
for the punishment of the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of So@@ dom , that was over@@ thrown as in a moment , and no hands stayed on her .
now it came to pass in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river of C@@ he@@ bar , that the heav@@ ens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
and I looked , and , be@@ hold , a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind came out of the north , a great cl@@ oud , and a fire in@@ fol@@ ding itself , and a bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness was about it , and out of the mid@@ st there@@ of as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber , out of the mid@@ st of the fire .
as for the lik@@ eness of the living cre@@ atures , their appearance was like burning co@@ als of fire , and like the appearance of lam@@ ps : it went up and down among the living cre@@ atures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth ligh@@ t@@ ning .
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever the spirit was to go , they went , th@@ ither was their spirit to go ; and the whe@@ els were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
and under the fir@@ mam@@ ent were their w@@ ings stra@@ ight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
and above the fir@@ mam@@ ent that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one , as the appearance of a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone : and upon the lik@@ eness of the th@@ r@@ one was the lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and I saw as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber , as the appearance of fire round about within it , from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even up@@ ward , and from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even down@@ ward , I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and it had bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness round about .
then I ar@@ ose , and went forth into the pla@@ in : and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord stood there , as the gl@@ ory which I saw by the river of C@@ he@@ bar : and I fell on my face .
but th@@ ou , O son of man , be@@ hold , they shall put bands upon the@@ e , and shall bin@@ d the@@ e with them , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not go out among them :
and I will make TH@@ Y ton@@ gue cle@@ ave to the ro@@ of of TH@@ Y m@@ outh , that th@@ ou s@@ halt be dum@@ b , and s@@ halt not be to them a re@@ pro@@ ver : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
but when I speak with the@@ e , I will open TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; He that he@@ aret@@ h , let him hear ; and he that for@@ be@@ aret@@ h , let him for@@ bear : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
then take of them again , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the fire , and bur@@ n them in the fire ; for there@@ of shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause ye multi@@ p@@ lied more than the nations that are round about you , and have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither have kept my judg@@ ments , neither have done according to the judg@@ ments of the nations that are round about you ;
therefore the fa@@ thers shall eat the sons in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , and the sons shall eat their fa@@ thers ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in the@@ e , and the whole re@@ mn@@ ant of the@@ e will I sc@@ at@@ ter into all the winds .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God ; su@@ rely , because th@@ ou h@@ ast def@@ iled my sanc@@ tu@@ ary with all TH@@ Y de@@ te@@ stable things , and with all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations , therefore will I also dimin@@ ish the@@ e ; neither shall mine eye spar@@ e , neither will I have any p@@ ity .
and say , Y@@ e mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God to the mountains , and to the hil@@ ls , to the rivers , and to the val@@ ley@@ s ; be@@ hold , I , even I , will bring a s@@ word upon you , and I will destroy your high places .
he that is far off shall die of the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and he that is near shall fall by the s@@ word ; and he that remain@@ eth and is bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed shall die by the fam@@ ine : thus will I accomp@@ lish my fur@@ y upon them .
and mine eye shall not spar@@ e the@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : but I will re@@ compen@@ se TH@@ Y ways upon the@@ e , and th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations shall be in the mid@@ st of the@@ e : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and mine eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : I will re@@ compen@@ se the@@ e according to TH@@ Y ways and th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations that are in the mid@@ st of the@@ e ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord that sm@@ ite@@ th .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is tou@@ ching the whole multi@@ tude there@@ of , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his life .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the el@@ ders of Ju@@ da@@ h sat before me , that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me .
then I be@@ held , and lo a lik@@ eness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even down@@ ward , fire ; and from his lo@@ ins even up@@ ward , as the appearance of bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber .
then said he un@@ to me , Son of man , lift up th@@ ine eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and be@@ hold nor@@ th@@ ward at the gate of the alt@@ ar this image of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y in the entry .
and he brought me into the in@@ ner court of the Lord 's house , and , be@@ hold , at the door of the temp@@ le of the Lord , between the por@@ ch and the alt@@ ar , were about five and twenty men , with their backs toward the temp@@ le of the Lord , and their faces toward the east ; and they wor@@ shi@@ pped the sun toward the east .
and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was gone up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , where@@ upon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en , which had the writer 's in@@ k@@ hor@@ n by his side ;
and the Lord said un@@ to him , G@@ o through the mid@@ st of the city , through the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem , and set a mark upon the fore@@ heads of the men that si@@ gh and that cry for all the ab@@ omin@@ ations that be done in the mid@@ st there@@ of .
then I looked , and , be@@ hold , in the fir@@ mam@@ ent that was above the head of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms there appeared over them as it were a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one .
then the gl@@ ory of the Lord went up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cl@@ oud , and the court was full of the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of the Lord 's gl@@ ory .
and one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b stret@@ ched forth his hand from between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms un@@ to the fire that was between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , and took there@@ of , and put it into the hands of him that was clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en : who took it , and went out .
and when I looked , be@@ hold the four whe@@ els by the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , one whe@@ el by one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and another whe@@ el by another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : and the appearance of the whe@@ els was as the col@@ our of a ber@@ y@@ l stone .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els , were full of eyes round about , even the whe@@ els that they four had .
and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms lifted up their w@@ ings , and moun@@ ted up from the ear@@ th in my sight : when they went out , the whe@@ els also were bes@@ ide them , and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord 's house ; and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was over them above .
and the Spiri@@ t of the Lord fell upon me , and said un@@ to me , Spe@@ ak ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord ; Th@@ us have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spiri@@ t of God into Chal@@ de@@ a , to them of the cap@@ tivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
in their sight s@@ halt th@@ ou bear it upon TH@@ Y sho@@ ul@@ ders , and carry it forth in the tw@@ il@@ ight : th@@ ou s@@ halt cover TH@@ Y face , that th@@ ou see not the ground : for I have set the@@ e for a sign un@@ to the house of Israel .
and I did so as I was comman@@ ded : I brought forth my stu@@ ff by day , as stu@@ ff for cap@@ tivity , and in the even I dig@@ ged through the wall with mine hand ; I brought it forth in the tw@@ il@@ ight , and I b@@ are it upon my sho@@ ul@@ der in their sight .
my net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are : and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on to the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
so will I break down the wall that ye have da@@ ub@@ ed with un@@ temper@@ ed mor@@ ter , and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation there@@ of shall be discovered , and it shall fall , and ye shall be consu@@ med in the mid@@ st there@@ of : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked , that he should not return from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , by promising him life :
be@@ hold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less shall it be meet yet for any work , when the fire hat@@ h dev@@ oured it , and it is burned ?
and as for TH@@ Y nati@@ vity , in the day th@@ ou w@@ ast born TH@@ Y nav@@ el was not cut , neither w@@ ast th@@ ou was@@ hed in water to supp@@ le the@@ e ; th@@ ou w@@ ast not sal@@ ted at all , nor sw@@ add@@ led at all .
none eye p@@ iti@@ ed the@@ e , to do any of these un@@ to the@@ e , to have comp@@ as@@ sion upon the@@ e ; but th@@ ou w@@ ast cast out in the open field , to the lo@@ thing of TH@@ Y person , in the day that th@@ ou w@@ ast born .
thus w@@ ast th@@ ou dec@@ ked with gold and silver ; and TH@@ Y ra@@ im@@ ent was of fine lin@@ en , and sil@@ k , and bro@@ i@@ dered work ; th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st eat fine fl@@ our , and hon@@ ey , and oil : and th@@ ou w@@ ast exceeding beautiful , and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st prosp@@ er into a k@@ ing@@ dom .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also taken TH@@ Y fair je@@ wel@@ s of my gold and of my silver , which I had given the@@ e , and ma@@ dest to th@@ y@@ self images of men , and di@@ d@@ st commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with them ,
and I will also give the@@ e into their hand , and they shall throw down th@@ ine emin@@ ent place , and shall break down TH@@ Y high places : they shall stri@@ p the@@ e also of TH@@ Y clo@@ th@@ es , and shall take TH@@ Y fair je@@ wel@@ s , and leave the@@ e nak@@ ed and b@@ are .
and they shall bur@@ n th@@ ine houses with fire , and exec@@ ute judg@@ ments upon the@@ e in the sight of many women : and I will cause the@@ e to ce@@ ase from playing the har@@ lot , and th@@ ou also s@@ halt give no h@@ ire any more .
T@@ ho@@ u art TH@@ Y mother 's daughter , that lo@@ th@@ eth her husband and her children ; and th@@ ou art the sister of TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , which lo@@ th@@ ed their hus@@ bands and their children : your mother was an H@@ itti@@ te , and your father an Am@@ or@@ ite .
and th@@ ine el@@ der sister is Samar@@ ia , she and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that d@@ well at TH@@ Y left hand : and TH@@ Y younger sister , that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th at TH@@ Y right hand , is So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
when I shall bring again their cap@@ tivity , the cap@@ tivity of So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , then will I bring again the cap@@ tivity of TH@@ Y cap@@ tives in the mid@@ st of them :
when TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , shall return to their former estate , and Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to their former estate , then th@@ ou and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to your former estate .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and will p@@ lead with him there for his t@@ res@@ pass that he hat@@ h t@@ res@@ passed against me .
and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; In the day when I chose Israel , and lifted up mine hand un@@ to the se@@ ed of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and made myself known un@@ to them in the land of Egypt , when I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them , saying , I am the Lord your God ;
in the day that I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had es@@ p@@ ied for them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands :
but I w@@ rought for my name 's sake , that it should not be pollu@@ ted before the he@@ a@@ then , among whom they were , in whose sight I made myself known un@@ to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
yet also I lifted up my hand un@@ to them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands ;
and I will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the countries where@@ in ye are sc@@ at@@ tered , with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with a stret@@ ched out arm , and with fur@@ y p@@ oured out .
and I will pur@@ ge out from among you the rebels , and them that trans@@ gress against me : I will bring them forth out of the country where they so@@ jour@@ n , and they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
as for you , O house of Israel , thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; G@@ o ye , serve ye every one his id@@ ols , and her@@ e@@ after also , if ye will not he@@ arken un@@ to me : but poll@@ ute ye my hol@@ y name no more with your gifts , and with your id@@ ols .
for in mine hol@@ y mountain , in the mountain of the he@@ ight of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them in the land , serve me : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offer@@ ings , and the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of your ob@@ lations , with all your hol@@ y things .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fa@@ thers .
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your do@@ ings , where@@ in ye have been def@@ iled ; and ye shall lo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for all your ev@@ ils that ye have committed .
and he hat@@ h give it to be fur@@ b@@ ished , that it may be handled : this s@@ word is shar@@ pen@@ ed , and it is fur@@ b@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the S@@ lay@@ er .
also , th@@ ou son of man , appoint the@@ e two ways , that the s@@ word of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on may come : both tw@@ ain shall come forth out of one land : and choose th@@ ou a place , choose it at the head of the way to the city .
thus will I make TH@@ Y le@@ w@@ d@@ ness to ce@@ ase from the@@ e , and TH@@ Y wh@@ ore@@ dom brought from the land of Egypt : so that th@@ ou s@@ halt not lift up th@@ ine eyes un@@ to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
that they have committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and blood is in their hands , and with their id@@ ols have they committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and have also caused their sons , whom they b@@ are un@@ to me , to pass for them through the fire , to dev@@ our them .
then set it empty upon the co@@ als there@@ of , that the br@@ ass of it may be hot , and may bur@@ n , and that the fil@@ th@@ iness of it may be m@@ ol@@ ten in it , that the sc@@ um of it may be consu@@ med .
be@@ hold , therefore I will deliver the@@ e to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their pal@@ aces in the@@ e , and make their d@@ wel@@ lings in the@@ e : they shall eat TH@@ Y fruit , and they shall drink TH@@ Y milk .
and they shall make a sp@@ oil of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches , and make a pre@@ y of TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise : and they shall break down TH@@ Y walls , and destroy TH@@ Y pleas@@ ant houses : and they shall lay TH@@ Y stones and TH@@ Y tim@@ ber and TH@@ Y d@@ ust in the mid@@ st of the water .
then all the pr@@ inces of the sea shall come down from their th@@ ron@@ es , and lay away their rob@@ es , and put off their bro@@ i@@ dered gar@@ ments : they shall clo@@ the themselves with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling ; they shall sit upon the ground , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble at every moment , and be ast@@ on@@ ished at the@@ e .
and all that handle the o@@ ar , the mar@@ in@@ ers , and all the pil@@ ots of the sea , shall come down from their ships , they shall stand upon the land ;
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are sc@@ at@@ tered , and shall be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , then shall they d@@ well in their land that I have given to my ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b .
but I will put ho@@ oks in TH@@ Y j@@ a@@ ws , and I will cause the fish of TH@@ Y rivers to stick un@@ to TH@@ Y scal@@ es , and I will bring the@@ e up out of the mid@@ st of TH@@ Y rivers , and all the fish of TH@@ Y rivers shall stick un@@ to TH@@ Y scal@@ es .
and I will leave the@@ e thrown into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , the@@ e and all the fish of TH@@ Y rivers : th@@ ou s@@ halt fall upon the open fields ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not be brought together , nor gathered : I have given the@@ e for meat to the be@@ asts of the field and to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en .
when they took hold of the@@ e by TH@@ Y hand , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st break , and ren@@ d all their sho@@ ul@@ der : and when they le@@ an@@ ed upon the@@ e , th@@ ou br@@ ak@@ est , and ma@@ dest all their lo@@ ins to be at a stand .
and I will make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late , and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be de@@ so@@ late for@@ ty years : and I will sc@@ at@@ ter the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans among the nations , and will disper@@ se them through the countries .
and I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of P@@ ath@@ ros , into the land of their habi@@ tation ; and they shall be there a base k@@ ing@@ dom .
and it came to pass in the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
and I will make the rivers d@@ ry , and sell the land into the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked : and I will make the land waste , and all that is there@@ in , by the hand of st@@ ran@@ gers : I the Lord have spoken it .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will also destroy the id@@ ols , and I will cause their images to ce@@ ase out of N@@ op@@ h ; and there shall be no more a pr@@ ince of the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
at Te@@ ha@@ ph@@ ne@@ hes also the day shall be dar@@ ken@@ ed , when I shall break there the yok@@ es of Egypt : and the pom@@ p of her strength shall ce@@ ase in her : as for her , a cl@@ oud shall cover her , and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall go into cap@@ tivity .
and it came to pass in the ele@@ venth year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , I have broken the arm of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt ; and , lo , it shall not be bound up to be he@@ aled , to put a rol@@ ler to bin@@ d it , to make it strong to hold the s@@ word .
all the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en made their nes@@ ts in his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and under his branches did all the be@@ asts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow d@@ wel@@ t all great nations .
then will I leave the@@ e upon the land , I will cast the@@ e forth upon the open field , and will cause all the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en to remain upon the@@ e , and I will fill the be@@ asts of the whole ear@@ th with the@@ e .
and when I shall put the@@ e out , I will cover the heav@@ en , and make the stars there@@ of dark ; I will cover the sun with a cl@@ oud , and the moon shall not give her light .
when I shall make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late , and the country shall be de@@ stitute of that where@@ of it was full , when I shall sm@@ ite all them that d@@ well there@@ in , then shall they know that I am the Lord .
son of man , speak to the children of TH@@ Y people , and say un@@ to them , When I bring the s@@ word upon a land , if the people of the land take a man of their co@@ asts , and set him for their watch@@ man :
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , su@@ rely because my flock became a pre@@ y , and my flock became meat to every be@@ ast of the field , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , neither did my she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds search for my flock , but the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds f@@ ed themselves , and f@@ ed not my flock ;
and I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and fe@@ ed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will seek that which was lost , and bring again that which was driven away , and will bin@@ d up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was si@@ ck : but I will destroy the f@@ at and the strong ; I will fe@@ ed them with judgment .
Se@@ eme@@ th it a small thing un@@ to you to have e@@ aten up the good pas@@ ture , but ye must tre@@ ad down with your feet the resi@@ due of your pas@@ tures ? and to have dr@@ un@@ k of the deep waters , but ye must f@@ oul the resi@@ due with your feet ?
and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will take the children of Israel from among the he@@ a@@ then , w@@ hi@@ ther they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all : and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms any more at all :
neither shall they def@@ ile themselves any more with their id@@ ols , nor with their de@@ te@@ stable things , nor with any of their trans@@ gres@@ sions : but I will save them out of all their d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places , where@@ in they have sin@@ ned , and will cleans@@ e them : so shall they be my people , and I will be their God .
and they shall d@@ well in the land that I have given un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , where@@ in your fa@@ thers have d@@ wel@@ t ; and they shall d@@ well there@@ in , even they , and their children , and their children 's children for ever : and my ser@@ vant David shall be their pr@@ ince for ever .
and I will p@@ lead against him with p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce and with blood ; and I will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many people that are with him , an over@@ flow@@ ing rain , and great ha@@ il@@ stones , fire , and bri@@ m@@ stone .
and I will turn the@@ e back , and leave but the sixth part of the@@ e , and will cause the@@ e to come up from the north parts , and will bring the@@ e upon the mountains of Israel :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fall upon the mountains of Israel , th@@ ou , and all TH@@ Y bands , and the people that is with the@@ e : I will give the@@ e un@@ to the ra@@ ven@@ ous birds of every sort , and to the be@@ asts of the field to be dev@@ oured .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall bur@@ n the weapons with fire : and they shall sp@@ oil those that sp@@ o@@ iled them , and ro@@ b those that ro@@ bbed them , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , which cause them to be led into cap@@ tivity among the he@@ a@@ then : but I have gathered them un@@ to their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
in the five and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year after that the city was s@@ mit@@ ten , in the sel@@ f@@ same day the hand of the Lord was upon me , and brought me th@@ ither .
and he brought me th@@ ither , and , be@@ hold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of br@@ ass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring Re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he un@@ to the gate which lo@@ ok@@ eth toward the east , and went up the st@@ airs there@@ of , and meas@@ ured the threshold of the gate , which was one Re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one Re@@ ed broad .
the space also before the little ch@@ ambers was one cu@@ bit on this side , and the space was one cu@@ bit on that side : and the little ch@@ ambers were six cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
and the little ch@@ ambers there@@ of were three on this side and three on that side ; and the posts there@@ of and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were after the measure of the first gate : the length there@@ of was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were before them : and it had pal@@ m trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts there@@ of .
and at the side without , as one go@@ eth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the por@@ ch of the gate , were two tables .
and he meas@@ ured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it , and the gal@@ ler@@ ies there@@ of on the one side and on the other side , an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , with the in@@ ner temp@@ le , and the por@@ ches of the court ;
the door posts , and the narrow windows , and the gal@@ ler@@ ies round about on their three stories , over against the door , ci@@ eled with wood round about , and from the ground up to the windows , and the windows were covered ;
and it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city : and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar ; and I fell upon my face .
it is for the pr@@ ince ; the pr@@ ince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord ; he shall enter by the way of the por@@ ch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
in that ye have brought into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary st@@ ran@@ gers , un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart , and un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in f@@ les@@ h , to be in my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , to poll@@ ute it , even my house , when ye offer my bread , the f@@ at and the blood , and they have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant because of all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
and they shall not come near un@@ to me , to do the office of a pri@@ est un@@ to me , nor to come near to any of my hol@@ y things , in the most hol@@ y place : but they shall bear their sh@@ ame , and their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed .
and it shall come to pass , that when they enter in at the gates of the in@@ ner court , they shall be clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en gar@@ ments ; and no wo@@ ol shall come upon them , wh@@ il@@ es they minister in the gates of the in@@ ner court , and within .
and the first of all the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of all things , and every ob@@ lation of all , of every sort of your ob@@ lations , shall be the pri@@ est 's : ye shall also give un@@ to the pri@@ est the first of your d@@ ough , that he may cause the b@@ les@@ sing to rest in th@@ ine house .
moreover , when ye shall divide by lot the land for inher@@ it@@ ance , ye shall offer an ob@@ lation un@@ to the Lord , an hol@@ y portion of the land : the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand re@@ eds , and the b@@ read@@ th shall be ten thousand . this shall be hol@@ y in all the borders there@@ of round about .
and the pri@@ est shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it upon the posts of the house , and upon the four cor@@ ners of the settle of the alt@@ ar , and upon the posts of the gate of the in@@ ner court .
in the seventh month , in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the month , shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days , according to the sin offering , according to the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and according to the meat offering , and according to the oil .
after he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the hol@@ y ch@@ ambers of the pri@@ ests , which looked toward the north : and , be@@ hold , there was a place on the two sides w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard .
then brought he me out of the way of the gate nor@@ th@@ ward , and led me about the way without un@@ to the ut@@ ter gate by the way that lo@@ ok@@ eth eas@@ tw@@ ard ; and , be@@ hold , there ran out waters on the right side .
and it shall come to pass , that the fis@@ hers shall stand upon it from En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di even un@@ to En @@@ -@@ @ eg@@ la@@ im ; they shall be a place to spread forth n@@ ets ; their fish shall be according to their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
and these shall be the measures there@@ of ; the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
and the subur@@ bs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the south two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the east two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the west two hundred and fif@@ ty .
and the resi@@ due in length over against the ob@@ lation of the hol@@ y portion shall be ten thousand eas@@ tw@@ ard , and ten thousand w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard : and it shall be over against the ob@@ lation of the hol@@ y portion ; and the increase there@@ of shall be for food un@@ to them that serve the city .
moreover from the possession of the L@@ evi@@ tes , and from the possession of the city , being in the mid@@ st of that which is the pr@@ ince 's , between the border of Ju@@ da@@ h and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the pr@@ ince .
and the Lord gave Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God : which he carried into the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar to the house of his go@@ d ; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his go@@ d .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king sent to gather together the pr@@ inces , the govern@@ ors , and the cap@@ tains , the judges , the treas@@ ur@@ ers , the coun@@ sel@@ lers , the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ffs , and all the rul@@ ers of the provinces , to come to the dedic@@ ation of the image which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king had set up .
then was Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar full of fur@@ y , and the form of his vis@@ age was changed against Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go : therefore he sp@@ ake , and comman@@ ded that they should heat the fur@@ n@@ ace one seven times more than it was won@@ t to be heated .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my go@@ d , and in whom is the spirit of the hol@@ y go@@ ds : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
the leaves there@@ of were fair , and the fruit there@@ of much , and in it was meat for all : the be@@ asts of the field had shadow under it , and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en d@@ wel@@ t in the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s there@@ of , and all f@@ les@@ h was f@@ ed of it .
nevertheless leave the st@@ um@@ p of his roots in the ear@@ th , even with a band of iron and br@@ ass , in the tender gr@@ ass of the field ; and let it be w@@ et with the dew of heav@@ en , and let his portion be with the be@@ asts in the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th :
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temp@@ le of the house of God which was at Jer@@ usalem ; and the king , and his pr@@ inces , his wi@@ ves , and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , d@@ rank in them .
in the same hour came forth fin@@ gers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the cand@@ le@@ stick upon the pla@@ ister of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
and now the wise men , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation there@@ of : but they could not she@@ w the interpre@@ tation of the thing :
then comman@@ ded Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , and they clo@@ th@@ ed Daniel with scar@@ let , and put a chain of gold about his nec@@ k , and made a proc@@ lamation concerning him , that he should be the third ru@@ ler in the k@@ ing@@ dom .
then the king , when he heard these words , was sor@@ e disp@@ le@@ ased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he la@@ b@@ oured ti@@ ll the going down of the sun to deliver him .
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and comman@@ ded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
I make a decree , That in every domin@@ ion of my k@@ ing@@ dom men tre@@ m@@ ble and fear before the God of Daniel : for he is the living God , and ste@@ d@@ fast for ever , and his k@@ ing@@ dom that which shall not be destroyed , and his domin@@ ion shall be even un@@ to the end .
and I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was at Sh@@ us@@ han in the palace , which is in the province of E@@ lam ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of U@@ la@@ i .
then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , be@@ hold , there stood before the river a ram which had two hor@@ ns : and the two hor@@ ns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
O my God , inc@@ line th@@ ine e@@ ar , and hear ; open th@@ ine eyes , and be@@ hold our de@@ so@@ lations , and the city which is called by TH@@ Y name : for we do not present our supp@@ lic@@ ations before the@@ e for our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ nesses , but for TH@@ Y great mer@@ cies .
Ye@@ a , wh@@ il@@ es I was speaking in pray@@ er , even the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swi@@ f@@ tly , touched me about the time of the evening ob@@ lation .
yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I in a deep sle@@ ep on my face , and my face toward the ground .
but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate , which shall come with an army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prev@@ ail :
and the king of the south shall be moved with cho@@ ler , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north : and he shall set forth a great multi@@ tude ; but the multi@@ tude shall be given into his hand .
for the ships of Ch@@ it@@ tim shall come against him : therefore he shall be gri@@ ev@@ ed , and return , and have in@@ dign@@ ation against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant : so shall he do ; he shall even return , and have intelligence with them that for@@ sake the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
the word of the Lord that came un@@ to Hos@@ ea , the son of Be@@ eri , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the days of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash , king of Israel .
yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the s@@ and of the sea , which can@@ not be meas@@ ured nor num@@ ber@@ ed ; and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are not my people , there it shall be said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are the sons of the living God .
L@@ est I stri@@ p her nak@@ ed , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and set her like a d@@ ry land , and s@@ lay her with thir@@ st .
and I will give her her v@@ ine@@ yards from th@@ ence , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
therefore shall the land mour@@ n , and every one that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th there@@ in shall langu@@ ish , with the be@@ asts of the field , and with the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en ; ye@@ a , the fis@@ hes of the sea also shall be taken away .
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made pr@@ inces , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them id@@ ols , that they may be cut off .
though he be fruit@@ ful among his bre@@ th@@ ren , an east wind shall come , the wind of the Lord shall come up from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and his spring shall become d@@ ry , and his fo@@ un@@ tain shall be dri@@ ed up : he shall sp@@ oil the treasure of all pleas@@ ant vessels .
the v@@ ine is dri@@ ed up , and the fi@@ g tree langu@@ is@@ het@@ h ; the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate tree , the pal@@ m tree also , and the app@@ le tree , even all the trees of the field , are with@@ ered : because joy is with@@ ered away from the sons of men .
I will also gather all nations , and will bring them down into the val@@ ley of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and will p@@ lead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel , whom they have sc@@ at@@ tered among the nations , and par@@ ted my land .
Ye@@ a , and what have ye to do with me , O T@@ y@@ re , and Z@@ id@@ on , and all the co@@ asts of Palest@@ ine ? will ye ren@@ der me a re@@ comp@@ ence ? and if ye re@@ comp@@ ence me , swi@@ f@@ tly and spe@@ edil@@ y will I return your re@@ comp@@ ence upon your own head ;
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the mountains shall drop down new wine , and the hil@@ ls shall flow with milk , and all the rivers of Ju@@ da@@ h shall flow with waters , and a fo@@ un@@ tain shall come forth of the house of the Lord , and shall water the val@@ ley of Sh@@ it@@ tim .
I will break also the bar of Dam@@ as@@ cus , and cut off the inhabi@@ tant from the pla@@ in of Av@@ en , and him that hol@@ de@@ th the scep@@ tre from the house of E@@ den : and the people of Syria shall go into cap@@ tivity un@@ to K@@ ir , sa@@ ith the Lord .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of the children of Am@@ mon , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they have ri@@ pped up the women with child of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , that they might en@@ large their border :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Ju@@ da@@ h , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they have desp@@ ised the law of the Lord , and have not kept his comman@@ d@@ ments , and their lies caused them to er@@ r , after the which their fa@@ thers have walked :
and also I have with@@ hol@@ den the rain from you , when there were yet three months to the har@@ v@@ est : and I caused it to rain upon one city , and caused it not to rain upon another city : one piece was ra@@ ined upon , and the piece where@@ upon it ra@@ ined not with@@ ered .
For@@ as@@ much therefore as your t@@ reading is upon the poor , and ye take from him bur@@ den@@ s of wheat : ye have built houses of he@@ wn stone , but ye shall not d@@ well in them ; ye have plan@@ ted pleas@@ ant v@@ ine@@ yards , but ye shall not drink wine of them .
and though they hide themselves in the top of Car@@ mel , I will search and take them out th@@ ence ; and though they be hi@@ d from my sight in the bottom of the sea , th@@ ence will I command the ser@@ p@@ ent , and he shall bi@@ te them :
it is he that buil@@ de@@ th his stories in the heav@@ en , and hat@@ h founded his troop in the ear@@ th ; he that cal@@ le@@ th for the waters of the sea , and p@@ ou@@ re@@ th them out upon the face of the ear@@ th : the Lord is his name .
and I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of my people of Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they shall plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and drink the wine there@@ of ; they shall also make gar@@ den@@ s , and eat the fruit of them .
but th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest not have looked on the day of TH@@ Y brother in the day that he became a st@@ ran@@ ger ; neither sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou have re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed over the children of Ju@@ da@@ h in the day of their destruction ; neither sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou have spoken pro@@ u@@ dly in the day of dist@@ ress .
T@@ ho@@ u sho@@ ul@@ dest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest not have looked on their aff@@ li@@ ction in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity , nor have laid hands on their sub@@ stance in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity ;
and the house of Jac@@ o@@ b shall be a fire , and the house of Joseph a fla@@ me , and the house of E@@ sa@@ u for st@@ ub@@ ble , and they shall kin@@ dle in them , and dev@@ our them ; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of E@@ sa@@ u ; for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
and the Lord God prepared a go@@ ur@@ d , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his gri@@ ef . so Jon@@ ah was exceeding glad of the go@@ ur@@ d .
the bre@@ aker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord on the head of them .
who also eat the f@@ les@@ h of my people , and fla@@ y their s@@ kin from off them ; and they break their b@@ ones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the po@@ t , and as f@@ les@@ h within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
therefore night shall be un@@ to you , that ye shall not have a vision ; and it shall be dark un@@ to you , that ye shall not div@@ ine ; and the sun shall go down over the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the day shall be dark over them .
but in the last days it shall come to pass , that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains , and it shall be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and people shall flow un@@ to it .
and they shall waste the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a with the s@@ word , and the land of N@@ im@@ ro@@ d in the en@@ tran@@ ces there@@ of : thus shall he deliver us from the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an , when he co@@ me@@ th into our land , and when he tre@@ ade@@ th within our borders .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt eat , but not be satisfied ; and TH@@ Y casting down shall be in the mid@@ st of the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt take hold , but s@@ halt not deliver ; and that which th@@ ou deliver@@ est will I give up to the s@@ word .
I will bear the in@@ dign@@ ation of the Lord , because I have sin@@ ned against him , until he p@@ lead my cause , and exec@@ ute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall be@@ hold his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
the Hor@@ sem@@ an lif@@ te@@ th up both the bright s@@ word and the g@@ lit@@ tering spe@@ ar : and there is a multi@@ tude of sla@@ in , and a great number of car@@ cases ; and there is none end of their cor@@ p@@ ses ; they st@@ um@@ ble upon their cor@@ p@@ ses :
yet was she carried away , she went into cap@@ tivity : her young children also were d@@ ashed in pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her honour@@ able men , and all her great men were bound in cha@@ ins .
TH@@ Y crow@@ ned are as the loc@@ ust@@ s , and TH@@ Y cap@@ tains as the great gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers , which camp in the h@@ ed@@ ges in the cold day , but when the sun ar@@ is@@ eth they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
their hor@@ ses also are swi@@ f@@ ter than the le@@ op@@ ards , and are more fierce than the evening w@@ ol@@ ves : and their hor@@ se@@ men shall spread themselves , and their hor@@ se@@ men shall come from far ; they shall fly as the e@@ ag@@ le that has@@ te@@ th to eat .
the word of the Lord which came un@@ to Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of C@@ us@@ hi , the son of G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Amar@@ i@@ ah , the son of Hiz@@ ki@@ ah , in the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
in that day s@@ halt th@@ ou not be as@@ ha@@ med for all TH@@ Y do@@ ings , where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : for then I will take away out of the mid@@ st of the@@ e them that re@@ jo@@ ice in TH@@ Y pride , and th@@ ou s@@ halt no more be ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty because of my hol@@ y mountain .
the Lord hat@@ h taken away TH@@ Y judg@@ ments , he hat@@ h cast out th@@ ine enemy : the king of Israel , even the Lord , is in the mid@@ st of the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt not see ev@@ il any more .
in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , came the word of the Lord by Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t un@@ to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , governor of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est , saying ,
Y@@ e have so@@ wn much , and bring in little ; ye eat , but ye have not enough ; ye drink , but ye are not filled with drink ; ye clo@@ the you , but there is none warm ; and he that ear@@ net@@ h wages ear@@ net@@ h wages to put it into a bag with ho@@ les .
and I called for a drought upon the land , and upon the mountains , and upon the cor@@ n , and upon the new wine , and upon the oil , and upon that which the ground br@@ ing@@ eth forth , and upon men , and upon c@@ attle , and upon all the labour of the hands .
then Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , and Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est , with all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people , obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord their God , and the words of Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , as the Lord their God had sent him , and the people did fear before the Lord .
and I will overthrow the th@@ r@@ one of k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms , and I will destroy the strength of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the he@@ a@@ then ; and I will overthrow the char@@ i@@ ots , and those that ride in them ; and the hor@@ ses and their ri@@ ders shall come down , every one by the s@@ word of his brother .
upon the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the ele@@ venth month , which is the month S@@ eb@@ at , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , came the word of the Lord un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
then lifted I up mine eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their w@@ ings ; for they had w@@ ings like the w@@ ings of a stor@@ k : and they lifted up the ep@@ ha@@ h between the ear@@ th and the heav@@ en .
take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ da@@ i , of To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , which are come from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and come th@@ ou the same day , and go into the house of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah ;
and speak un@@ to him , saying , Th@@ us speak@@ eth the Lord of hosts , saying , be@@ hold the man whose name is The branch ; and he shall grow up out of his place , and he shall build the temp@@ le of the Lord :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; I am returned un@@ to Z@@ ion , and will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem : and Jer@@ usalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the Lord of hosts the hol@@ y mountain .
and I will en@@ camp about mine house because of the army , because of him that pass@@ eth by , and because of him that retur@@ net@@ h : and no op@@ pres@@ sor shall pass through them any more : for now have I seen with mine eyes .
and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a cro@@ wn , lifted up as an en@@ sign upon his land .
and they shall be as m@@ igh@@ ty men , which tre@@ ad down their enem@@ ies in the m@@ ire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the Lord is with them , and the ri@@ ders on hor@@ ses shall be con@@ founded .
and I will strengthen the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them again to place them ; for I have mer@@ cy upon them : and they shall be as though I had not cast them off : for I am the Lord their God , and will hear them .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will bring them into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and L@@ aban@@ on ; and place shall not be found for them .
and he shall pass through the sea with aff@@ li@@ ction , and shall sm@@ ite the waves in the sea , and all the deep@@ s of the river shall d@@ ry up : and the pride of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a shall be brought down , and the scep@@ tre of Egypt shall de@@ part away .
then said I , I will not fe@@ ed you : that that di@@ eth , let it die ; and that that is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let the rest eat every one the f@@ les@@ h of another .
in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord , I will sm@@ ite every hor@@ se with ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , and his Ri@@ der with mad@@ ness : and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and will sm@@ ite every hor@@ se of the people with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
and it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , that I will cut off the names of the id@@ ols out of the land , and they shall no more be remember@@ ed : and also I will cause the pro@@ ph@@ ets and the un@@ clean spirit to pass out of the land .
for I will gather all nations against Jer@@ usalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses rif@@ led , and the women ra@@ vis@@ hed ; and half of the city shall go forth into cap@@ tivity , and the resi@@ due of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jer@@ usalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hin@@ der sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and this shall be the pla@@ gue where@@ with the Lord will sm@@ ite all the people that have fought against Jer@@ usalem ; The@@ ir f@@ les@@ h shall consum@@ e away while they stand upon their feet , and their eyes shall consum@@ e away in their ho@@ les , and their ton@@ gue shall consum@@ e away in their m@@ outh .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a great t@@ um@@ ult from the Lord shall be among them ; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour , and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour .
and so shall be the pla@@ gue of the hor@@ se , of the mul@@ e , of the C@@ ame@@ l , and of the ass , and of all the be@@ asts that shall be in these ten@@ ts , as this pla@@ gue .
and it shall come to pass , that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jer@@ usalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , and to keep the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
be@@ hold , I will send my mes@@ sen@@ ger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the Lord , whom ye seek , shall su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come to this temp@@ le , even the mes@@ sen@@ ger of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , whom ye de@@ light in : be@@ hold , he shall come , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
and I will re@@ bu@@ ke the dev@@ ou@@ rer for your sak@@ es , and he shall not destroy the fru@@ its of your ground ; neither shall your v@@ ine cast her fruit before the time in the field , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
and when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented un@@ to him gifts ; gold , and fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h .
but when he heard that Ar@@ che@@ laus did reign in Ju@@ da@@ ea in the room of his father Her@@ od , he was afraid to go th@@ ither : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Gal@@ il@@ ee :
and his f@@ ame went throughout all Syria : and they brought un@@ to him all si@@ ck people that were taken with di@@ vers diseases and tor@@ ments , and those which were poss@@ essed with dev@@ ils , and those which were lun@@ ati@@ ck , and those that had the pal@@ sy ; and he he@@ aled them .
but I say un@@ to you , That wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall say to his brother , R@@ aca , shall be in danger of the council : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall say , T@@ ho@@ u fo@@ ol , shall be in danger of hell fire .
but I say un@@ to you , Lo@@ ve your enem@@ ies , b@@ less them that cur@@ se you , do good to them that h@@ ate you , and pra@@ y for them which desp@@ ite@@ fully use you , and persec@@ ute you ;
and he said un@@ to them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one she@@ ep , and if it fall into a p@@ it on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
for this people 's heart is wa@@ xed gross , and their e@@ ars are dul@@ l of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their e@@ ars , and should understand with their heart , and should be conver@@ ted , and I should he@@ al them .
and he comman@@ ded the multi@@ tude to sit down on the gr@@ ass , and took the five lo@@ aves , and the two fis@@ hes , and looking up to heav@@ en , he b@@ les@@ sed , and br@@ ake , and gave the lo@@ aves to his dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to the multi@@ tude .
and in the morning , It will be f@@ oul weather to day : for the sky is red and low@@ ring . O ye hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes , ye can dis@@ cer@@ n the face of the sky ; but can ye not dis@@ cer@@ n the signs of the times ?
for there are some e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which were so born from their mother 's w@@ om@@ b : and there are some e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which were made e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s of men : and there be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which have made themselves e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s for the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en 's sake . he that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
and they cru@@ ci@@ fied him , and par@@ ted his gar@@ ments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the pro@@ phe@@ t , They par@@ ted my gar@@ ments among them , and upon my ves@@ ture did they cast lots .
and when they could not come n@@ igh un@@ to him for the press , they uncovered the ro@@ of where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed where@@ in the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy lay .
and for@@ th@@ with J@@ es@@ us gave them leave . and the un@@ clean spir@@ its went out , and entered into the sw@@ ine : and the her@@ d ran viol@@ ently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were ch@@ oked in the sea .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye de@@ part th@@ ence , shake off the d@@ ust under your feet for a testimony against them . Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , It shall be more toler@@ able for So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , That wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall say un@@ to this mountain , Be th@@ ou removed , and be th@@ ou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he sa@@ ith shall come to pass ; he shall have wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he sa@@ ith .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt love the Lord TH@@ Y God with all TH@@ Y heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l , and with all TH@@ Y mind , and with all TH@@ Y strength : this is the first comman@@ d@@ ment .
but when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought be@@ fore@@ hand what ye shall speak , neither do ye pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ate : but wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy gh@@ ost .
but when ye shall see the ab@@ omin@@ ation of de@@ so@@ lation , spoken of by Daniel the pro@@ phe@@ t , standing where it ought not , ( let him that re@@ ade@@ th understand , ) then let them that be in Ju@@ da@@ ea flee to the mountains :
and Joseph also went up from Gal@@ il@@ ee , out of the city of N@@ azar@@ eth , into Ju@@ da@@ ea , un@@ to the city of David , which is called B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem ; ( because he was of the house and lin@@ e@@ age of David : )
and it came to pass , as the an@@ gel@@ s were gone away from them into heav@@ en , the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds said one to another , Let us now go even un@@ to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hat@@ h made known un@@ to us .
and it came to pass on the second sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath after the first , that he went through the cor@@ n fields ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les p@@ lu@@ cked the e@@ ars of cor@@ n , and did eat , rub@@ bing them in their hands .
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart br@@ ing@@ eth forth that which is good ; and an ev@@ il man out of the ev@@ il treasure of his heart br@@ ing@@ eth forth that which is ev@@ il : for of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the heart his m@@ outh speak@@ eth .
they are like un@@ to children sitting in the market@@ place , and calling one to another , and saying , We have pip@@ ed un@@ to you , and ye have not dan@@ ced ; we have mour@@ ned to you , and ye have not we@@ pt .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall be as@@ ha@@ med of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be as@@ ha@@ med , when he shall come in his own gl@@ ory , and in his F@@ ather 's , and of the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s .
and on the mor@@ row when he depar@@ ted , he took out two p@@ ence , and gave them to the host , and said un@@ to him , T@@ ake care of him ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou sp@@ en@@ dest more , when I come again , I will repay the@@ e .
in the mean time , when there were gathered together an in@@ num@@ er@@ able multi@@ tude of people , ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that they tro@@ de one upon another , he began to say un@@ to his dis@@ cip@@ les first of all , be@@ w@@ are ye of the le@@ av@@ en of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , which is hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
the father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
in that day , he which shall be upon the hous@@ et@@ op , and his stu@@ ff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
and it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the k@@ ing@@ dom , then he comman@@ ded these servants to be called un@@ to him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
then let them which are in Ju@@ da@@ ea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the mid@@ st of it de@@ part out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter there@@ into .
and when Her@@ od saw J@@ es@@ us , he was exceeding glad : for he was desi@@ ro@@ us to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some mir@@ acle done by him .
and when he had made a s@@ cour@@ ge of small cor@@ ds , he dro@@ ve them all out of the temp@@ le , and the she@@ ep , and the ox@@ en ; and p@@ oured out the chan@@ gers ' money , and over@@ threw the tables ;
and J@@ es@@ us took the lo@@ aves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fis@@ hes as much as they would .
and this is the F@@ ather 's will which hat@@ h sent me , that of all which he hat@@ h given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
I am the living bread which came down from heav@@ en : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my f@@ les@@ h , which I will give for the life of the world .
but he that is an hi@@ re@@ ling , and not the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , whose own the she@@ ep are not , se@@ eth the w@@ ol@@ f coming , and le@@ av@@ eth the she@@ ep , and fle@@ eth : and the w@@ ol@@ f cat@@ ch@@ eth them , and sc@@ at@@ ter@@ eth the she@@ ep .
but the Com@@ for@@ ter , which is the Holy gh@@ ost , whom the F@@ ather will send in my name , he shall te@@ ach you all things , and bring all things to your re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever I have said un@@ to you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedi@@ ent for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Com@@ for@@ ter will not come un@@ to you ; but if I de@@ part , I will send him un@@ to you .
then she run@@ net@@ h , and co@@ me@@ th to Simon Peter , and to the other dis@@ cip@@ le , whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , They have taken away the Lord out of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and we know not where they have laid him .
therefore that dis@@ cip@@ le whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed sa@@ ith un@@ to Peter , It is the Lord . now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he gir@@ t his Fis@@ her 's co@@ at un@@ to him , ( for he was nak@@ ed , ) and did cast himself into the sea .
therefore being a pro@@ phe@@ t , and kno@@ wing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his lo@@ ins , according to the f@@ les@@ h , he would raise up Ch@@ r@@ ist to sit on his th@@ r@@ one ;
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the A@@ post@@ les , and beaten them , they comman@@ ded that they should not speak in the name of J@@ es@@ us , and let them go .
and he tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling and ast@@ on@@ ished said , Lord , what w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou have me to do ? and the Lord said un@@ to him , arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told the@@ e what th@@ ou must do .
send therefore to J@@ op@@ pa , and call hi@@ ther Simon , whose sur@@ name is Peter ; he is lo@@ d@@ ged in the house of one Simon a tan@@ ner by the sea side : who , when he co@@ me@@ th , shall speak un@@ to the@@ e .
For@@ as@@ much as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , sub@@ ver@@ ting your so@@ ul@@ s , saying , Y@@ e must be circum@@ c@@ ised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such comman@@ d@@ ment :
and hat@@ h made of one blood all nations of men for to d@@ well on all the face of the ear@@ th , and hat@@ h determined the times before appointed , and the bo@@ unds of their habi@@ tation ;
because he hat@@ h appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness by that man whom he hat@@ h or@@ da@@ ined ; where@@ of he hat@@ h given assur@@ ance un@@ to all men , in that he hat@@ h raised him from the dead .
and it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a stra@@ ight course un@@ to Co@@ os , and the day following un@@ to R@@ ho@@ des , and from th@@ ence un@@ to Pat@@ ara :
and the next day we that were of Paul 's company depar@@ ted , and came un@@ to Ca@@ es@@ area : and we entered into the house of Philip the Evangel@@ ist , which was one of the seven ; and abo@@ de with him .
and when there ar@@ ose a great dis@@ sen@@ sion , the chief captain , fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , comman@@ ded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
and on the mor@@ row , when Agri@@ p@@ pa was come , and Bern@@ ice , with great pom@@ p , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief cap@@ tains , and principal men of the city , at F@@ es@@ tus ' comman@@ d@@ ment Paul was brought forth .
which thing I also did in Jer@@ usalem : and many of the sa@@ ints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief pri@@ ests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
but rise , and stand upon TH@@ Y feet : for I have appeared un@@ to the@@ e for this purpose , to make the@@ e a minister and a witness both of these things which th@@ ou h@@ ast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear un@@ to the@@ e ;
and when we came to Rome , the centur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to d@@ well by himself with a soldier that kept him .
for the heart of this people is wa@@ xed gross , and their e@@ ars are dul@@ l of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their e@@ ars , and understand with their heart , and should be conver@@ ted , and I should he@@ al them .
and if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . but if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
for if th@@ ou w@@ ert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and w@@ ert gra@@ ff@@ ed contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be gra@@ ff@@ ed into their own olive tree ?
he that regar@@ de@@ th the day , regar@@ de@@ th it un@@ to the Lord ; and he that regar@@ de@@ th not the day , to the Lord he do@@ th not regard it . he that e@@ ate@@ th , e@@ ate@@ th to the Lord , for he gi@@ vet@@ h God thanks ; and he that e@@ ate@@ th not , to the Lord he e@@ ate@@ th not , and gi@@ vet@@ h God thanks .
now I bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , by the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perf@@ ec@@ tly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
and I wrote this same un@@ to you , lest , when I came , I should have sor@@ row from them of whom I ought to re@@ jo@@ ice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
For@@ as@@ much as ye are manif@@ est@@ ly declared to be the ep@@ ist@@ le of Ch@@ r@@ ist minist@@ ered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spiri@@ t of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fle@@ sh@@ y tables of the heart .
while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are tempor@@ al ; but the things which are not seen are eter@@ nal .
( for he sa@@ ith , I have heard the@@ e in a time accepted , and in the day of sal@@ vation have I succ@@ oured the@@ e : be@@ hold , now is the accepted time ; be@@ hold , now is the day of sal@@ vation . )
for if I have bo@@ asted any thing to him of you , I am not as@@ ha@@ med ; but as we sp@@ ake all things to you in truth , even so our bo@@ asting , which I made before Tit@@ us , is found a truth .
do ye look on things after the ou@@ tw@@ ard appearance ? if any man trust to himself that he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , even so are we Ch@@ r@@ ist 's .
not bo@@ asting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's la@@ bour@@ s ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be en@@ lar@@ ged by you according to our rule ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly ,
for ye suffer , if a man bring you into bon@@ da@@ ge , if a man dev@@ our you , if a man take of you , if a man ex@@ alt himself , if a man sm@@ ite you on the face .
for though I would desire to gl@@ ory , I shall not be a fo@@ ol ; for I will say the truth : but now I for@@ bear , lest any man should think of me above that which he se@@ eth me to be , or that he he@@ aret@@ h of me .
and lest I should be ex@@ al@@ ted above measure through the ab@@ und@@ ance of the reve@@ lations , there was given to me a Th@@ or@@ n in the f@@ les@@ h , the mes@@ sen@@ ger of S@@ atan to bu@@ ff@@ et me , lest I should be ex@@ al@@ ted above measure .
that in the dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ation of the ful@@ ness of times he might gather together in one all things in Ch@@ r@@ ist , both which are in heav@@ en , and which are on ear@@ th ; even in him :
from whom the whole body f@@ it@@ ly joined together and comp@@ acted by that which every joint supp@@ li@@ eth , according to the effec@@ tual working in the measure of every part , mak@@ eth increase of the body un@@ to the edi@@ fying of itself in love .
finally , bre@@ th@@ ren , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are true , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are honest , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are just , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are p@@ ure , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are lov@@ ely , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are of good report ; if there be any vir@@ tu@@ e , and if there be any praise , think on these things .
Paul , and Sil@@ van@@ us , and Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us , un@@ to the church of the Thessalon@@ ians which is in God the F@@ ather and in the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist : grace be un@@ to you , and peace , from God our F@@ ather , and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and veril@@ y they that are of the sons of L@@ evi , who receive the office of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , have a comman@@ d@@ ment to take ti@@ th@@ es of the people according to the law , that is , of their bre@@ th@@ ren , though they come out of the lo@@ ins of Ab@@ ra@@ ham :
for this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , sa@@ ith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hear@@ ts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
and the ton@@ gue is a fire , a world of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : so is the ton@@ gue among our members , that it def@@ il@@ eth the whole body , and set@@ te@@ th on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
speak not ev@@ il one of another , bre@@ th@@ ren . he that speak@@ eth ev@@ il of his brother , and jud@@ get@@ h his brother , speak@@ eth ev@@ il of the law , and jud@@ get@@ h the law : but if th@@ ou judge the law , th@@ ou art not a do@@ er of the law , but a judge .
be@@ hold , the h@@ ire of the la@@ bour@@ ers who have re@@ ap@@ ed down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , cri@@ eth : and the cri@@ es of them which have re@@ ap@@ ed are entered into the e@@ ars of the Lord of sa@@ ba@@ o@@ th .
for what gl@@ ory is it , if , when ye be bu@@ ffe@@ ted for your fa@@ ults , ye shall take it pati@@ ently ? but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it pati@@ ently , this is acceptable with God .
if ye be re@@ pro@@ ached for the name of Ch@@ r@@ ist , happy are ye ; for the spirit of gl@@ ory and of God res@@ te@@ th upon you : on their part he is ev@@ il spoken of , but on your part he is gl@@ ori@@ fied .
I have written un@@ to you , fa@@ thers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written un@@ to you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abi@@ de@@ th in you , and ye have overcome the w@@ ic@@ ked one .
they went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manif@@ est that they were not all of us .
let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the F@@ ather .
and every spirit that conf@@ ess@@ eth not that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist is come in the f@@ les@@ h is not of God : and this is that spirit of anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist , where@@ of ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
these things have I written un@@ to you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eter@@ nal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
and to the an@@ gel of the church in Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a write ; These things sa@@ ith he that is hol@@ y , he that is true , he that hat@@ h the key of David , he that open@@ eth , and no man shut@@ te@@ th ; and shut@@ te@@ th , and no man open@@ eth ;
be@@ hold , I will make them of the syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; be@@ hold , I will make them to come and worship before TH@@ Y feet , and to know that I have lov@@ ed the@@ e .
and I be@@ held , and , lo , in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one and of the four be@@ asts , and in the mid@@ st of the el@@ ders , stood a lam@@ b as it had been sla@@ in , having seven hor@@ ns and seven eyes , which are the seven spir@@ its of God sent forth into all the ear@@ th .
and the kings of the ear@@ th , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief cap@@ tains , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men , and every bon@@ d@@ man , and every free man , hi@@ d themselves in the den@@ s and in the ro@@ cks of the mountains ;
and thus I saw the hor@@ ses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having bre@@ ast@@ plates of fire , and of j@@ ac@@ inth , and bri@@ m@@ stone : and the heads of the hor@@ ses were as the heads of li@@ ons ; and out of their m@@ ou@@ ths issued fire and smoke and bri@@ m@@ stone .
and I took the little book out of the an@@ gel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my m@@ outh swe@@ et as hon@@ ey : and as soon as I had e@@ aten it , my bel@@ ly was bitter .
and his ta@@ il drew the third part of the stars of heav@@ en , and did cast them to the ear@@ th : and the dra@@ g@@ on stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to dev@@ our her child as soon as it was born .
and the great dra@@ g@@ on was cast out , that old ser@@ p@@ ent , called the dev@@ il , and S@@ atan , which dec@@ e@@ i@@ vet@@ h the whole world : he was cast out into the ear@@ th , and his an@@ gel@@ s were cast out with him .
and to the woman were given two w@@ ings of a great e@@ ag@@ le , that she might fly into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , into her place , where she is no@@ ur@@ ished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the ser@@ p@@ ent .
and the be@@ ast which I saw was like un@@ to a Le@@ op@@ ard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his m@@ outh as the m@@ outh of a lion : and the dra@@ g@@ on gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
he that le@@ ade@@ th into cap@@ tivity shall go into cap@@ tivity : he that kil@@ le@@ th with the s@@ word must be killed with the s@@ word . here is the patience and the faith of the sa@@ ints .
and he had power to give life un@@ to the image of the be@@ ast , that the image of the be@@ ast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the be@@ ast should be killed .
and I saw as it were a sea of glass min@@ g@@ led with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the be@@ ast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having the har@@ ps of God .
and the first went , and p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the ear@@ th ; and there fell a no@@ is@@ ome and gri@@ ev@@ ous sor@@ e upon the men which had the mark of the be@@ ast , and upon them which wor@@ shi@@ pped his image .
and the light of a cand@@ le shall sh@@ ine no more at all in the@@ e ; and the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and of the bri@@ de shall be heard no more at all in the@@ e : for TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts were the great men of the ear@@ th ; for by TH@@ Y sor@@ cer@@ ies were all nations dec@@ e@@ ived .
and I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God ; and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were jud@@ ged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the hol@@ y city , and from the things which are written in this book .
