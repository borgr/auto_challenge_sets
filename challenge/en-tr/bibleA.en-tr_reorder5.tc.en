now the earth was formless and empty . darkness was on the surface of the deep . God 's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters .
God saw the light , and saw that it was good . God divided the light from the darkness .
God said , " Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters . "
God made the expanse , and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse ; and it was so .
God said , " Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place , and let the dry land appear " ; and it was so .
the earth yielded grass , herbs yielding seed after their kind , and trees bearing fruit , with its seed in it , after their kind ; and God saw that it was good .
God made the two great lights : the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night . he also made the stars .
God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth ,
God said , " Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky . "
God said , " Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind , livestock , creeping things , and animals of the earth after their kind " ; and it was so .
God made the animals of the earth after their kind , and the livestock after their kind , and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God said , " behold , I have given you every herb yielding seed , which is on the surface of all the earth , and every tree , which bears fruit yielding seed . it will be your food .
God saw everything that he had made , and , behold , it was very good . there was evening and there was morning , a sixth day .
the heavens and the earth were finished , and all their vast array .
on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
this is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens .
but a mist went up from the earth , and watered the whole surface of the ground .
Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
Yahweh God planted a garden eastward , in Eden , and there he put the man whom he had formed .
a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from there it was parted , and became four heads .
the name of the first is Pishon : this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold ;
and the gold of that land is good . there is aromatic resin and the onyx stone .
the name of the second river is Gihon : the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush .
the name of the third river is Hiddekel : this is the one which flows in front of Assyria . the fourth river is the Euphrates .
Yahweh God took the man , and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it .
Yahweh God commanded the man , saying , " Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat ;
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die . "
the man gave names to all livestock , and to the birds of the sky , and to every animal of the field ; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him .
Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man , and he slept ; and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh in its place .
he made the rib , which Yahweh God had taken from the man , into a woman , and brought her to the man .
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother , and will join with his wife , and they will be one flesh .
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden , God has said , ' You shall not eat of it , neither shall you touch it , lest you die . ' "
for God knows that in the day you eat it , your eyes will be opened , and you will be like God , knowing good and evil . "
the eyes of both of them were opened , and they knew that they were naked . they sewed fig leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden .
the man said , " I heard your voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself . "
the man said , " The woman whom you gave to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I ate . "
I will put enmity between you and the woman , and between your offspring and her offspring . he will bruise your head , and you will bruise his heel . "
it will yield thorns and thistles to you ; and you will eat the herb of the field .
by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are dust , and to dust you shall return . "
therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden , to till the ground from which he was taken .
so he drove out the man ; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden , and the flame of a sword which turned every way , to guard the way to the tree of life .
the man knew Eve his wife . she conceived , and gave birth to Cain , and said , " I have gotten a man with Yahweh 's help . "
again she gave birth , to Cain 's brother Abel . Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
as time passed , it happened that Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground .
but he didn 't respect Cain and his offering . Cain was very angry , and the expression on his face fell .
if you do well , will it not be lifted up ? if you don 't do well , sin crouches at the door . its desire is for you , but you are to rule over it . "
now you are Cursed because of the ground , which has opened its mouth to receive your brother 's blood from your hand .
from now on , when you till the ground , it won 't yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . "
Yahweh said to him , " Therefore whoever slays Cain , vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold . " Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain , lest any finding him should strike him .
Cain went out from Yahweh 's presence , and lived in the land of nod , east of Eden .
to Enoch was born Irad . Irad became the father of Mehujael . Mehujael became the father of Methushael . Methushael became the father of Lamech .
Lamech took two wives : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other Zillah .
Adah gave birth to Jabal , who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock .
his brother 's name was Jubal , who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe .
this is the book of the generations of Adam . in the day that God created man , he made him in God 's likeness .
he created them male and female , and blessed them , and called their name " Adam , " in the day when they were created .
Adam lived one hundred thirty years , and became the father of a son in his own likeness , after his image , and named him Seth .
the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years , and he became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years , then he died .
Seth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred seven years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years , then he died .
Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan , eight hundred fifteen years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years , then he died .
Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years , and became the father of sons and daughters
and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years , then he died .
Mahalalel lived sixty @-@ five years , and became the father of Jared .
Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred thirty years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety @-@ five years , then he died .
Jared lived one hundred sixty @-@ two years , and became the father of Enoch .
Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty @-@ two years , then he died .
Enoch walked with God after he became the father of Methuselah three hundred years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty @-@ five years .
Methuselah lived one hundred eighty @-@ seven years , and became the father of Lamech .
Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty @-@ two years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty @-@ nine years , then he died .
Lamech lived one hundred eighty @-@ two years , and became the father of a son ,
Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred ninety @-@ five years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy @-@ seven years , then he died .
Noah was five hundred years old , and Noah became the father of Shem , ham , and Japheth .
it happened , when men began to multiply on the surface of the ground , and daughters were born to them ,
that God 's sons saw that men 's daughters were beautiful , and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose .
Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him in his heart .
this is the history of the generations of Noah . Noah was a righteous man , blameless among the people of his time . Noah walked with God .
the earth was corrupt before God , and the earth was filled with violence .
God saw the earth , and saw that it was corrupt , for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth .
God said to Noah , " The end of all flesh has come before me , for the earth is filled with violence through them . behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
make a ship of gopher wood . you shall make rooms in the ship , and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch .
this is how you shall make it . the length of the ship will be three hundred cubits , its breadth fifty cubits , and its height thirty cubits .
I , even I , do bring the flood of waters on this earth , to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky . everything that is in the earth will die .
but I will establish my Covenant with you . you shall come into the ship , you , your sons , your wife , and your sons ' wives with you .
of every living thing of all flesh , you shall bring two of every sort into the ship , to keep them alive with you . they shall be male and female .
take with you of all food that is eaten , and gather it to yourself ; and it will be for food for you , and for them . "
you shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you , the male and his female . of the animals that are not clean , take two , the male and his female .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the surface of the ground . "
Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth .
Noah went into the ship with his sons , his wife , and his sons ' wives , because of the waters of the flood .
clean animals , animals that are not clean , birds , and everything that creeps on the ground
it happened after the seven days , that the waters of the flood came on the earth .
they went to Noah into the ship , by pairs of all flesh with the breath of life in them .
those who went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God commanded him ; and Yahweh shut him in .
the flood was forty days on the earth . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the earth .
the waters prevailed , and increased greatly on the earth ; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters .
the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth . all the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered .
God remembered Noah , all the animals , and all the livestock that were with him in the ship ; and God made a wind to pass over the earth . the waters subsided .
the deep 's fountains and the sky 's windows were also stopped , and the rain from the sky was restrained .
the waters receded from the earth continually . after the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased .
the ship rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , on Ararat 's mountains .
the waters receded continually until the tenth month . in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , the tops of the mountains were seen .
it happened at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made ,
and he sent out a raven . it went back and forth , until the waters were dried up from the earth .
he sent out a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground ,
he stayed yet another seven days ; and again he sent the dove out of the ship .
the dove came back to him at evening , and , behold , in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off . so Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth .
he stayed yet another seven days , and sent out the dove ; and she didn 't return to him any more .
in the second month , on the twenty @-@ seventh day of the month , the earth was dry .
Noah went out , with his sons , his wife , and his sons ' wives with him .
every animal , every creeping thing , and every bird , whatever moves on the earth , after their families , went out of the ship .
Noah built an altar to Yahweh , and took of every clean animal , and of every clean bird , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
every moving thing that lives will be food for you . as the green herb , I have given everything to you .
God said , " This is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you , for perpetual generations :
I set my rainbow in the cloud , and it will be for a sign of a Covenant between me and the earth .
it will happen , when I bring a cloud over the earth , that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud ,
the sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem , ham , and Japheth . ham is the father of Canaan .
ham , the father of Canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brothers outside .
Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it on both their shoulders , went in backwards , and covered the nakedness of their father . their faces were backwards , and they didn 't see their father 's nakedness .
Noah awoke from his wine , and knew what his youngest son had done to him .
he said , " blessed be Yahweh , the God of Shem . let Canaan be his servant .
all the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years , then he died .
of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands , everyone after his language , after their families , in their nations .
Cush became the father of Nimrod . he began to be a mighty one in the earth .
the beginning of his kingdom was Babel , Erech , Accad , and Calneh , in the land of Shinar .
Mizraim became the father of Ludim , Anamim , Lehabim , Naphtuhim ,
Canaan became the father of Sidon ( his firstborn ) , Heth ,
the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as you go toward Gerar , to Gaza ; as you go toward Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboiim , to Lasha .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , in their nations .
to Shem , the father of all the children of Eber , the elder brother of Japheth , to him also were children born .
to Eber were born two sons . the name of the one was Peleg , for in his days the earth was divided . his brother 's name was Joktan .
their dwelling was from Mesha , as you go toward Sephar , the mountain of the east .
these are the sons of Shem , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , after their nations .
these are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations . of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
it happened , as they traveled east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar , and they lived there .
they said one to another , " Come , let 's make bricks , and burn them thoroughly . " they had brick for stone , and they used tar for mortar .
Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower , which the children of men built .
Yahweh said , " behold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be withheld from them , which they intend to do .
come , let 's go down , and there confuse their language , that they may not understand one another 's speech . "
so Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth . they stopped building the city .
therefore its name was called Babel , because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth . from there , Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth .
this is the history of the generations of Shem . Shem was one hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood .
Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Arpachshad lived thirty @-@ five years and became the father of Shelah .
and Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor , and became the father of sons and daughters .
Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah , and became the father of sons and daughters .
now this is the history of the generations of Terah . Terah became the father of Abram , Nahor , and Haran . Haran became the father of lot .
Abram and Nahor took wives . the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai , and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah .
now Yahweh said to Abram , " Get out of your country , and from your relatives , and from your father 's house , to the land that I will show you .
I will make of you a great nation . I will bless you and make your name great . you will be a blessing .
I will bless those who bless you , and I will curse him who curses you . all of the families of the earth will be blessed in you . "
so Abram went , as Yahweh had spoken to him . lot went with him . Abram was seventy @-@ five years old when he departed out of Haran .
Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem , to the oak of Moreh . the Canaanite was then in the land .
Yahweh appeared to Abram and said , " I will give this land to your seed . " he built an altar there to Yahweh , who appeared to him .
there was a famine in the land . Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there , for the famine was severe in the land .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sarai his wife , " See now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
it will happen , when the Egyptians will see you , that they will say , ' This is his wife . ' they will kill me , but they will save you alive .
please say that you are my sister , that it may be well with me for your sake , and that my soul may live because of you . "
it happened that when Abram had come into Egypt , the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful .
the princes of Pharaoh saw her , and praised her to Pharaoh ; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh 's house .
Pharaoh called Abram and said , " What is this that you have done to me ? why didn 't you tell me that she was your wife ?
Abram went up out of Egypt : he , his wife , all that he had , and lot with him , into the South .
he went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel , to the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Bethel and AI ,
to the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first . there Abram called on the name of Yahweh .
the land was not able to bear them , that they might live together : for their substance was great , so that they could not live together .
there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram 's livestock and the herdsmen of lot 's livestock : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time .
Abram said to lot , " Please , let there be no strife between me and you , and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen ; for we are relatives .
so lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself . lot traveled east , and they separated themselves the one from the other .
Abram lived in the land of Canaan , and lot lived in the cities of the plain , and moved his tent as far as Sodom .
Yahweh said to Abram , after lot was separated from him , " Now , lift up your eyes , and look from the place where you are , northward and southward and eastward and westward ,
for all the land which you see , I will give to you , and to your offspring forever .
I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth , so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then your seed may also be numbered .
arise , walk through the land in its length and in its breadth ; for I will give it to you . "
Abram moved his tent , and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre , which are in Hebron , and built an altar there to Yahweh .
it happened in the days of Amraphel , king of Shinar , Arioch , king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer , king of Elam , and tidal , king of Goiim ,
that they made war with Bera , king of Sodom , and with Birsha , king of Gomorrah , Shinab , king of Admah , and Shemeber , king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( the same is Zoar ) .
they returned , and came to En Mishpat ( the same is Kadesh ) , and struck all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites , that lived in Hazazon Tamar .
now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits ; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , and they fell there , and those who remained fled to the hills .
they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their food , and went their way .
they took lot , Abram 's brother 's son , who lived in Sodom , and his goods , and departed .
when Abram heard that his relative was taken captive , he led out his trained men , born in his house , three hundred and Eighteen , and pursued as far as Dan .
he divided himself against them by night , he and his servants , and struck them , and pursued them to Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
he brought back all the goods , and also brought back his relative , lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine : and he was priest of God Most High .
he blessed him , and said , " blessed be Abram of God Most High , possessor of heaven and earth :
and blessed be God Most High , who has delivered your enemies into your hand . " Abram gave him a tenth of all .
Abram said , " behold , to me you have given no seed : and , behold , one born in my house is my heir . "
behold , the word of Yahweh came to him , saying , " This man will not be your heir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir . "
he said to him , " I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees , to give you this land to inherit it . "
he brought him all of these , and divided them in the middle , and laid each half opposite the other ; but he didn 't divide the birds .
the birds of prey came down on the carcasses , and Abram drove them away .
when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell on Abram . now terror and great darkness fell on him .
I will also judge that nation , whom they will serve . afterward they will come out with great wealth ,
but you will go to your fathers in peace . you will be buried in a good old age .
it came to pass that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold , a smoking furnace , and a flaming torch passed between these pieces .
now Sarai , Abram 's wife , bore him no children . she had a handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
Sarai , Abram 's wife , took Hagar the Egyptian , her handmaid , after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife .
he went in to Hagar , and she conceived . when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
but Abram said to Sarai , " behold , your maid is in your hand . do to her whatever is good in your eyes . " Sarai dealt harshly with her , and she fled from her face .
the angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
he said , " Hagar , Sarai 's handmaid , where did you come from ? where are you going ? " she said , " I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai . "
the angel of Yahweh said to her , " Return to your mistress , and submit yourself under her hands . "
the angel of Yahweh said to her , " I will greatly multiply your seed , that they will not be numbered for multitude . "
she called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her , " You are a God who sees , " for she said , " Have I even stayed alive after seeing him ? "
Hagar bore a son for Abram . Abram called the name of his son , whom Hagar bore , Ishmael .
I will make my Covenant between me and you , and will multiply you exceedingly . "
" as for me , behold , my Covenant is with you . you will be the father of a multitude of nations .
neither will your name any more be called Abram , but your name will be Abraham ; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations .
I will make you exceedingly fruitful , and I will make nations of you . Kings will come out of you .
I will establish my Covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting Covenant , to be a God to you and to your seed after you .
God said to Abraham , " As for you , you will keep my Covenant , you and your seed after you throughout their generations .
this is my Covenant , which you shall keep , between me and you and your seed after you . every male among you shall be circumcised .
you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin . it will be a token of the Covenant between me and you .
the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin , that soul shall be cut off from his people . he has broken my Covenant . "
but my Covenant I establish with Isaac , whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year . "
all the men of his house , those born in the house , and those bought with money of a foreigner , were circumcised with him .
Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre , as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day .
and said , " My lord , if now I have found favor in your sight , please don 't go away from your servant .
Abraham ran to the herd , and fetched a tender and good calf , and gave it to the servant . he hurried to dress it .
he took butter , milk , and the calf which he had dressed , and set it before them . he stood by them under the tree , and they ate .
now Abraham and Sarah were old , well advanced in age . Sarah had passed the age of childbearing .
is anything too hard for Yahweh ? at the set time I will return to you , when the season comes round , and Sarah will have a son . "
then Sarah denied , saying , " I didn 't laugh , " for she was afraid . he said , " No , but you did laugh . "
the men rose up from there , and looked toward Sodom . Abraham went with them to see them on their way .
since Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him ?
I will go down now , and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me . if not , I will know . "
he spoke to him yet again , and said , " What if there are forty found there ? " he said , " I will not do it for the forty 's sake . "
Yahweh went his way , as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham , and Abraham returned to his place .
he urged them greatly , and they came in with him , and entered into his house . he made them a feast , and baked unleavened bread , and they ate .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of Sodom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter .
lot went out to them to the door , and shut the door after him .
but the men reached out their hand , and brought lot into the house to them , and shut the door .
they struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great , so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
but he lingered ; and the men grabbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two daughters ' hands , Yahweh being merciful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
the sun had risen on the earth when lot came to Zoar .
then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky .
he overthrew those cities , all the plain , all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew on the ground .
but his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in which lot lived .
come , let 's make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve our father 's seed . "
they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father . he didn 't know when she lay down , nor when she arose .
they made their father drink wine that night also . the younger went and lay with him . he didn 't know when she lay down , nor when she got up .
the younger also bore a son , and called his name Ben Ammi . he is the father of the children of Ammon to this day .
Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South , and lived between Kadesh and Shur . he lived as a foreigner in Gerar .
Abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ear . the men were very scared .
Abraham said , " Because I thought , ' surely the fear of God is not in this place . they will kill me for my wife 's sake . '
besides , she is indeed my sister , the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
Abimelech took sheep and cattle , male servants and female servants , and gave them to Abraham , and restored Sarah , his wife , to him .
Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said , and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken .
Sarah conceived , and bore Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
Abraham called his son who was born to him , whom Sarah bore to him , Isaac .
Abraham circumcised his son , Isaac , when he was eight days old , as God had commanded him .
she said , " Who would have said to Abraham , that Sarah would nurse children ? for I have borne him a son in his old age . "
the child grew , and was weaned . Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned .
the water in the bottle was spent , and she cast the child under one of the shrubs .
get up , lift up the boy , and hold him in your hand . for I will make him a great nation . "
God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water . she went , filled the bottle with water , and gave the boy drink .
God was with the boy , and he grew . he lived in the wilderness , and became , as he grew up , an archer .
he lived in the wilderness of Paran . his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
it happened at that time , that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham , saying , " God is with you in all that you do .
Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well , which Abimelech 's servants had violently taken away .
he said , " You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand , that it may be a witness to me , that I have dug this well . "
so they made a Covenant at Beersheba . Abimelech rose up with Phicol , the captain of his army , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place far off .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Abraham built the altar there , and laid the wood in order , bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar , on the wood .
Abraham stretched out his hand , and took the knife to kill his son .
and said , " I have sworn by myself , says Yahweh , because you have done this thing , and have not withheld your son , your only son ,
that I will bless you greatly , and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens , and like the sand which is on the seashore . your seed will possess the gate of his enemies .
in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed , because you have obeyed my voice . "
it happened after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , " behold , Milcah , she also has borne children to your brother Nahor :
Sarah lived one hundred twenty @-@ seven years . this was the length of Sarah 's life .
Sarah died in Kiriath Arba ( the same is Hebron ) , in the land of Canaan . Abraham came to mourn for Sarah , and to weep for her .
Abraham rose up from before his dead , and spoke to the children of Heth , saying ,
" I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you . give me a possession of a burying @-@ place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight . "
Abraham rose up , and bowed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of Heth .
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth . Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
Abraham listened to Ephron . Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , according to the current merchants ' standard .
after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre ( that is , Hebron ) , in the land of Canaan .
the field , and the cave that is in it , were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth .
Abraham said to his servant , the elder of his house , who ruled over all that he had , " Please put your hand under my thigh .
I will make you swear by Yahweh , the God of heaven and the God of the earth , that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I live .
but you shall go to my country , and to my relatives , and take a wife for my son Isaac . "
the servant said to him , " What if the woman isn 't willing to follow me to this land ? must I bring your son again to the land you came from ? "
the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and swore to him concerning this matter .
the servant took ten camels , of his master 's camels , and departed , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , to the city of Nahor .
he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening , the time that women go out to draw water .
behold , I am standing by the spring of water . the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother , with her pitcher on her shoulder .
the young lady was very beautiful to look at , a virgin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pitcher , and came up .
the servant ran to meet her , and said , " Please give me a drink , a little water from your pitcher . "
she said , " Drink , my lord . " she hurried , and let down her pitcher on her hand , and gave him drink .
she hurried , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again to the well to draw , and drew for all his camels .
the man looked steadfastly at her , remaining silent , to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not .
it happened , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ,
she said to him , " I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah , whom she bore to Nahor . "
she said moreover to him , " We have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in . "
the young lady ran , and told her mother 's house about these words .
Rebekah had a brother , and his name was Laban . Laban ran out to the man , to the spring .
Sarah , my master 's wife , bore a son to my master when she was old . he has given all that he has to him .
he said to me , ' Yahweh , before whom I walk , will send his angel with you , and prosper your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
then will you be clear from my oath , when you come to my relatives . if they don 't give her to you , you shall be clear from my oath . '
I came this day to the spring , and said , ' Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , if now you do prosper my way which I go--
and she will tell me , " Drink , and I will also draw for your camels , " --let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master 's son . '
she hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , ' Drink , and I will also give your camels a drink . ' so I drank , and she also gave the camels a drink .
now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me . if not , tell me , that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left . "
behold , Rebekah is before you . take her , and go , and let her be your master 's son 's wife , as Yahweh has spoken . "
it happened that when Abraham 's servant heard their words , he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh .
the servant brought out jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing , and gave them to Rebekah . he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother .
they ate and drank , he and the men who were with him , and stayed all night . they rose up in the morning , and he said , " Send me away to my master . "
her brother and her mother said , " Let the young lady stay with us a few days , at least ten . after that she will go . "
they sent away Rebekah , their sister , with her nurse , Abraham 's servant , and his men .
they blessed Rebekah , and said to her , " Our sister , may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands , and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them . "
Rebekah arose with her ladies . they rode on the camels , and followed the man . the servant took Rebekah , and went his way .
Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi , for he lived in the land of the South .
Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , there were camels coming .
Rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac , she dismounted from the Camel .
she said to the servant , " Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us ? " the servant said , " It is my master . " she took her veil , and covered herself .
Jokshan became the father of Sheba , and Dedan . the sons of Dedan were Asshurim , Letushim , and Leummim .
but to the sons of Abraham 's concubines , Abraham gave gifts . he sent them away from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , eastward , to the east country .
these are the days of the years of Abraham 's life which he lived : one hundred seventy @-@ five years .
Abraham gave up the spirit , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac and Ishmael , his sons , buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron , the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ,
the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth . Abraham was buried there with Sarah , his wife .
it happened after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac , his son . Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi .
now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's handmaid , bore to Abraham .
these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebaioth , then Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
these are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their encampments : twelve princes , according to their nations .
these are the years of the life of Ishmael : one hundred thirty @-@ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram , the sister of Laban the Syrian , to be his wife .
the children struggled together within her . she said , " If it be so , why do I live ? " she went to inquire of Yahweh .
when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
after that , his brother came out , and his hand had hold on Esau 's heel . he was named Jacob . Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them .
the boys grew . Esau was a skillful hunter , a man of the field . Jacob was a quiet man , living in tents .
there was a famine in the land , besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham . Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines , to Gerar .
Yahweh appeared to him , and said , " Don 't go down into Egypt . live in the land I will tell you about .
I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky , and will give to your seed all these lands . in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed ,
Abimelech said , " What is this you have done to us ? one of the people might easily have lain with your wife , and you would have brought guilt on us ! "
Isaac sowed in that land , and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted . Yahweh blessed him .
now all the wells which his father 's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped , and filled with earth .
Isaac 's servants dug in the valley , and found there a well of springing water .
he built an altar there , and called on the name of Yahweh , and pitched his tent there . there Isaac 's servants dug a well .
they rose up some time in the morning , and swore one to another . Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
it happened the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dug , and said to him , " We have found water . "
when Esau was forty years old , he took as wife Judith , the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basemath , the daughter of Elon the Hittite .
now therefore , please take your weapons , your quiver and your bow , and go out to the field , and take me venison .
make me savory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my soul may bless you before I die . "
Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son . Esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son , saying , " behold , I heard your father speak to Esau your brother , saying ,
now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command you .
go now to the flock , and get me from there two good young goats . I will make them savory food for your father , such as he loves .
you shall bring it to your father , that he may eat , so that he may bless you before his death . "
Jacob said to Rebekah his mother , " behold , Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am a smooth man .
what if my father touches me ? I will seem to him as a deceiver , and I would bring a curse on myself , and not a blessing . "
he went , and got them , and brought them to his mother . his mother made savory food , such as his father loved .
Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau , her elder son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob , her younger son .
she put the skins of the young goats on his hands , and on the smooth of his neck .
she gave the savory food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
Isaac said to his son , " How is it that you have found it so quickly , my son ? " he said , " Because Yahweh your God gave me success . "
Jacob went near to Isaac his father . he felt him , and said , " The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau . "
he didn 't recognize him , because his hands were hairy , like his brother , Esau 's hands . so he blessed him .
his father Isaac said to him , " Come near now , and kiss me , my son . "
God give you of the dew of the sky , of the fatness of the earth , and plenty of grain and new wine .
let peoples serve you , and nations bow down to you . be lord over your brothers . let your mother 's sons bow down to you . Cursed be everyone who curses you . blessed be everyone who blesses you . "
it happened , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
he also made savory food , and brought it to his father . he said to his father , " Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's venison , that your soul may bless me . "
when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " bless me , even me also , my father . "
Isaac his father answered him , " behold , of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling , and of the dew of the sky from above .
by your sword will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck . "
now therefore , my son , obey my voice . arise , flee to Laban , my brother , in Haran .
Isaac called Jacob , blessed him , and commanded him , " You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
May God Almighty bless you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , that you may be a company of peoples ,
and give you the blessing of Abraham , to you , and to your seed with you , that you may inherit the land where you travel , which God gave to Abraham . "
Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn 't please Isaac , his father .
Esau went to Ishmael , and took , besides the wives that he had , Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebaioth , to be his wife .
he dreamed . behold , a stairway set upon the earth , and its top reached to heaven . behold , the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
Jacob awakened out of his sleep , and he said , " surely Yahweh is in this place , and I didn 't know it . "
Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil on its top .
he called the name of that place Bethel , but the name of the city was Luz at the first .
Jacob vowed a vow , saying , " If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and clothing to put on ,
so that I come again to my father 's house in peace , and Yahweh will be my God ,
then this stone , which I have set up for a pillar , will be God 's house . of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you . "
then Jacob went on his journey , and came to the land of the children of the east .
he said , " behold , it is still the middle of the day , not time to gather the livestock together . water the sheep , and go and feed them . "
they said , " We can 't , until all the flocks are gathered together , and they roll the stone from the well 's mouth . then we water the sheep . "
while he was yet speaking with them , Rachel came with her father 's sheep , for she kept them .
Jacob kissed Rachel , and lifted up his voice , and wept .
Jacob told Rachel that he was her father 's brother , and that he was Rebekah 's son . she ran and told her father .
Laban said , " It is better that I give her to you , than that I should give her to another man . stay with me . "
Jacob said to Laban , " Give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in to her . "
it happened in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him . he went in to her .
fulfill the week of this one , and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years . "
Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah , his handmaid , to be her handmaid .
he went in also to Rachel , and he loved also Rachel more than Leah , and served with him yet seven other years .
when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children , Rachel envied her sister . she said to Jacob , " Give me children , or else I will die . "
Jacob 's anger was kindled against Rachel , and he said , " Am I in God 's place , who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb ? "
when Leah saw that she had finished bearing , she took Zilpah , her handmaid , and gave her to Jacob as a wife .
Leah said , " God has given me my hire , because I gave my handmaid to my husband . " she named him Issachar .
she conceived , bore a son , and said , " God has taken away my reproach . "
it happened , when Rachel had borne Joseph , that Jacob said to Laban , " Send me away , that I may go to my own place , and to my country .
give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you , and let me go ; for you know my service with which I have served you . "
he said , " appoint me your wages , and I will give it . "
he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering @-@ troughs where the flocks came to drink . they conceived when they came to drink .
the flocks conceived before the rods , and the flocks produced streaked , speckled , and spotted .
Jacob separated the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban : and he put his own droves apart , and didn 't put them into Laban 's flock .
it happened , whenever the stronger of the flock conceived , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods ;
but when the flock were feeble , he didn 't put them in . so the feebler were Laban 's , and the stronger Jacob 's .
Jacob saw the expression on Laban 's face , and , behold , it was not toward him as before .
and said to them , " I see the expression on your father 's face , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father has been with me .
you know that I have served your father with all of my strength .
if he said this , ' The speckled will be your wages , ' then all the flock bore speckled . if he said this , ' The streaked will be your wages , ' then all the flock bore streaked .
thus God has taken away your father 's livestock , and given them to me .
it happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and behold , the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked , speckled , and grizzled .
the angel of God said to me in the dream , ' Jacob , ' and I said , ' Here I am . '
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and behold , all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked , speckled , and grizzled , for I have seen all that Laban does to you .
for all the riches which God has taken away from our father , that is ours and our children 's . now then , whatever God has said to you , do . "
then Jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives on the camels ,
now Laban had gone to shear his sheep : and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father 's .
Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian , in that he didn 't tell him that he was running away .
so he fled with all that he had . he rose up , passed over the River , and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead .
he took his relatives with him , and pursued after him seven days ' journey . he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead .
God came to Laban , the Syrian , in a dream of the night , and said to him , " Take heed to yourself that you don 't speak to Jacob either good or bad . "
Laban caught up with Jacob . now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain , and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead .
and didn 't allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? now have you done foolishly .
now , you want to be gone , because you greatly longed for your father 's house , but why have you stolen my gods ? "
Jacob answered Laban , " Because I was afraid , for I said , ' Lest you should take your daughters from me by force . '
Laban went into Jacob 's tent , into Leah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he didn 't find them . he went out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
now Rachel had taken the teraphim , put them in the Camel 's saddle , and sat on them . Laban felt about all the tent , but didn 't find them .
" these twenty years I have been with you . your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young , and I haven 't eaten the rams of your flocks .
this was my situation : in the day the drought consumed me , and the Frost by night ; and my sleep fled from my eyes .
these twenty years I have been in your house . I served you fourteen years for your two daughters , and six years for your flock , and you have changed my wages ten times .
now come , let us make a Covenant , you and I ; and let it be for a witness between me and you . "
Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha , but Jacob called it Galeed .
if you afflict my daughters , or if you take wives besides my daughters , no man is with us ; behold , God is witness between me and you . "
May this heap be a witness , and the pillar be a witness , that I will not pass over this heap to you , and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me , for harm .
the God of Abraham , and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge between us . " then Jacob swore by the fear of his father , Isaac .
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain , and called his relatives to eat bread . they ate bread , and stayed all night in the mountain .
early in the morning , Laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them . Laban departed and returned to his place .
when he saw them , Jacob said , " This is God 's army . " he called the name of that place Mahanaim .
Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau , his brother , to the land of Seir , the field of Edom .
then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed . he divided the people who were with him , and the flocks , and the herds , and the camels , into two companies ;
and he said , " If Esau comes to the one company , and strikes it , then the company which is left will escape . "
you said , ' I will surely do you good , and make your seed as the sand of the sea , which can 't be numbered because there are so many . ' "
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every herd by itself , and said to his servants , " Pass over before me , and put a space between herd and herd . "
he commanded the foremost , saying , " When Esau , my brother , meets you , and asks you , saying , ' whose are you ? where are you going ? whose are these before you ? '
then you shall say , ' They are your servant , Jacob 's . it is a present sent to my lord , Esau . behold , he also is behind us . ' "
he commanded also the second , and the third , and all that followed the herds , saying , " This is how you shall speak to Esau , when you find him .
so the present passed over before him , and he himself lodged that night in the camp .
he rose up that night , and took his two wives , and his two handmaids , and his eleven sons , and passed over the Ford of the Jabbok .
he took them , and sent them over the stream , and sent over that which he had .
when he saw that he didn 't prevail against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh , and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was strained , as he wrestled .
the man said , " Let me go , for the day breaks . " Jacob said , " I won 't let you go , unless you bless me . "
Jacob called the name of the place Peniel : for , he said , " I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved . "
the sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel , and he limped because of his thigh .
therefore the children of Israel don 't eat the sinew of the hip , which is on the hollow of the thigh , to this day , because he touched the hollow of Jacob 's thigh in the sinew of the hip .
Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Esau was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Leah , Rachel , and the two handmaids .
he put the handmaids and their children in front , Leah and her children after , and Rachel and Joseph at the rear .
he himself passed over in front of them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , " Who are these with you ? " he said , " The children whom God has graciously given your servant . "
then the handmaids came near with their children , and they bowed themselves .
Leah also and her children came near , and bowed themselves . after them , Joseph came near with Rachel , and they bowed themselves .
please take the gift that I brought to you , because God has dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough . " he urged him , and he took it .
Jacob traveled to Succoth , built himself a house , and made shelters for his livestock . therefore the name of the place is called Succoth .
Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Paddan Aram ; and encamped before the city .
he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
he erected an altar there , and called it El Elohe Israel .
Dinah , the daughter of Leah , whom she bore to Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
Shechem spoke to his father , Hamor , saying , " Get me this young lady as a wife . "
now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah , his daughter ; and his sons were with his livestock in the field . Jacob held his peace until they came .
Hamor talked with them , saying , " The soul of my son , Shechem , longs for your daughter . please give her to him as a wife .
make marriages with us . give your daughters to us , and take our daughters for yourselves .
you shall dwell with us , and the land will be before you . live and trade in it , and get possessions in it . "
Shechem said to her father and to her brothers , " Let me find favor in your eyes , and whatever you will tell me I will give .
the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit , and spoke , because he had defiled Dinah their sister ,
only on this condition will we consent to you . if you will be as we are , that every male of you be circumcised ;
but if you will not listen to us , to be circumcised , then we will take our sister , and we will be gone . "
the young man didn 't wait to do this thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter , and he was honored above all the house of his father .
Hamor and Shechem , his son , came to the gate of their city , and talked with the men of their city , saying ,
only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us , to become one people , if every male among us is circumcised , as they are circumcised .
won 't their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours ? only let us give our consent to them , and they will dwell with us . "
they killed Hamor and Shechem , his son , with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went away .
Jacob 's sons came on the dead , and plundered the city , because they had defiled their sister .
they took their flocks , their herds , their donkeys , that which was in the city , that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth . they took captive all their little ones and their wives , and took as plunder everything that was in the house .
God said to Jacob , " arise , go up to Bethel , and live there . make there an altar to God , who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother . "
then Jacob said to his household , and to all who were with him , " Put away the foreign gods that are among you , purify yourselves , change your garments .
let us arise , and go up to Bethel . I will make there an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands , and the rings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem .
they traveled , and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them , and they didn 't pursue the sons of Jacob .
so Jacob came to Luz ( that is , Bethel ) , which is in the land of Canaan , he and all the people who were with him .
he built an altar there , and called the place El Beth El ; because there God was revealed to him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
Deborah , Rebekah 's nurse , died , and she was buried below Bethel under the oak ; and its name was called Allon Bacuth .
God said to him , " Your name is Jacob . your name shall not be Jacob any more , but your name will be Israel . " he named him Israel .
God said to him , " I am God Almighty . be fruitful and multiply . a nation and a company of nations will be from you , and kings will come out of your body .
the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac , I will give it to you , and to your seed after you will I give the land . "
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him , a pillar of stone . he poured out a drink offering on it , and poured oil on it .
Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him " Bethel . "
they traveled from Bethel . there was still some distance to come to Ephrath , and Rachel travailed . she had hard labor .
Jacob set up a pillar on her grave . the same is the Pillar of Rachel 's grave to this day .
it happened , while Israel lived in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah , his father 's concubine , and Israel heard of it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve .
the sons of Zilpah ( Leah 's handmaid ) : Gad and Asher . these are the sons of Jacob , who were born to him in Paddan Aram .
Isaac gave up the spirit , and died , and was gathered to his people , old and full of days . Esau and Jacob , his sons , buried him .
now this is the history of the generations of Esau ( that is , Edom ) .
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan : Adah the daughter of Elon , the Hittite ; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , the Hivite ;
Oholibamah bore Jeush , Jalam , and Korah . these are the sons of Esau , who were born to him in the land of Canaan .
for their substance was too great for them to dwell together , and the land of their travels couldn 't bear them because of their livestock .
this is the history of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir :
these are the names of Esau 's sons : Eliphaz , the son of Adah , the wife of Esau ; and Reuel , the son of Basemath , the wife of Esau .
these were the sons of Oholibamah , the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , Esau 's wife : she bore to Esau Jeush , Jalam , and Korah .
these are the chiefs of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau : chief Teman , chief Omar , chief Zepho , chief Kenaz ,
these are the sons of Oholibamah , Esau 's wife : chief Jeush , chief Jalam , chief Korah : these are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
these are the sons of Esau ( that is , Edom ) , and these are their chiefs .
these are the sons of Seir the Horite , the inhabitants of the land : Lotan , Shobal , Zibeon , Anah ,
Dishon , Ezer , and Dishan . these are the chiefs who came of the Horites , the children of Seir in the land of Edom .
these are the children of Anah : Dishon and Oholibamah , the daughter of Anah .
these are the chiefs who came of the Horites : chief Lotan , chief Shobal , chief Zibeon , chief Anah ,
chief Dishon , chief Ezer , and chief Dishan : these are the chiefs who came of the Horites , according to their chiefs in the land of Seir .
these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom , before any king reigned over the children of Israel .
Bela , the son of Beor , reigned in Edom . the name of his city was Dinhabah .
Bela died , and Jobab , the son of Zerah of Bozrah , reigned in his place .
Jobab died , and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place .
Husham died , and Hadad , the son of Bedad , who struck Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his place . the name of his city was Avith .
Samlah died , and Shaul of Rehoboth by the river , reigned in his place .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Timna , chief Alvah , chief Jetheth ,
chief Magdiel , and chief Iram . these are the chiefs of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession . this is Esau , the father of the Edomites .
Jacob lived in the land of his father 's travels , in the land of Canaan .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age , and he made him a coat of many colors .
his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers , and they hated him , and couldn 't speak peaceably to him .
Joseph dreamed a dream , and he told it to his brothers , and they hated him all the more .
for behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and behold , my sheaf arose and also stood upright ; and behold , your sheaves came around , and bowed down to my sheaf . "
his brothers said to him , " Will you indeed reign over us ? or will you indeed have dominion over us ? " they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words .
a certain man found him , and behold , he was wandering in the field . the man asked him , " What are you looking for ? "
the man said , " They have left here , for I heard them say , ' Let us go to Dothan . ' " Joseph went after his brothers , and found them in Dothan .
they saw him afar off , and before he came near to them , they conspired against him to kill him .
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the pits , and we will say , ' An evil animal has devoured him . ' we will see what will become of his dreams . "
Reuben heard it , and delivered him out of their hand , and said , " Let 's not take his life . "
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stripped Joseph of his coat , the coat of many colors that was on him ;
and they took him , and threw him into the pit . the pit was empty . there was no water in it .
come , and let 's sell him to the Ishmaelites , and not let our hand be on him ; for he is our brother , our flesh . " his brothers listened to him .
Reuben returned to the pit ; and saw that Joseph wasn 't in the pit ; and he tore his clothes .
they took Joseph 's coat , and killed a male goat , and dipped the coat in the blood .
they took the coat of many colors , and they brought it to their father , and said , " We have found this . examine it , now , whether it is your son 's coat or not . "
it happened at that time , that Judah went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua . he took her , and went in to her .
she yet again bore a son , and named him Shelah : and he was at Chezib , when she bore him .
Judah said to Onan , " Go in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up seed to your brother . "
it was told Tamar , saying , " behold , your father @-@ in @-@ law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep . "
when Judah saw her , he thought that she was a prostitute , for she had covered her face .
she arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend , the Adullamite , to receive the pledge from the woman 's hand , but he didn 't find her .
it happened in the time of her travail , that behold , twins were in her womb .
afterward his brother came out , that had the scarlet thread on his hand , and his name was called Zerah .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there .
Yahweh was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man . he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
his master saw that Yahweh was with him , and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand .
he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand . he didn 't concern himself with anything , except for the food which he ate . Joseph was well @-@ built and handsome .
it happened after these things , that his master 's wife cast her eyes on Joseph ; and she said , " Lie with me . "
as she spoke to Joseph day by day , he didn 't listen to her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
about this time , he went into the house to do his work , and there were none of the men of the house inside .
when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and had run outside ,
it happened , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
she spoke to him according to these words , saying , " The Hebrew servant , whom you have brought to us , came in to me to mock me ,
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your servant did to me , " that his wrath was kindled .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
but Yahweh was with Joseph , and showed kindness to him , and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison . whatever they did there , he was responsible for it .
the keeper of the prison didn 't look after anything that was under his hand , because Yahweh was with him ; and that which he did , Yahweh made it prosper .
it happened after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Baker offended their lord , the king of Egypt .
Pharaoh was angry with his two officers , the chief cupbearer and the chief Baker .
he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph , and he took care of them . they stayed in prison many days .
they both dreamed a dream , each man his dream , in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the cupbearer and the Baker of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
Joseph came in to them in the morning , and saw them , and saw that they were sad .
he asked Pharaoh 's officers who were with him in custody in his master 's house , saying , " Why do you look so sad today ? "
they said to him , " We have dreamed a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it . " Joseph said to them , " Don 't interpretations belong to God ? please tell it to me . "
the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , " In my dream , behold , a vine was in front of me ,
and in the vine were three branches . it was as though it budded , it blossomed , and its clusters produced ripe grapes .
Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand ; and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand . "
within three more days , Pharaoh will lift up your head , and restore you to your office . you will give Pharaoh 's cup into his hand , the way you did when you were his cupbearer .
but remember me when it will be well with you , and please show kindness to me , and make mention of me to Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house .
for indeed , I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews , and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon . "
when the chief Baker saw that the interpretation was good , he said to Joseph , " I also was in my dream , and behold , three baskets of white bread were on my head .
in the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh , and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head . "
within three more days , Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you , and will hang you on a tree ; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you . "
it happened the third day , which was Pharaoh 's birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants , and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief Baker among his servants .
it happened at the end of two full years , that Pharaoh dreamed : and behold , he stood by the river .
behold , there came up out of the river seven cattle , sleek and fat , and they fed in the marsh grass .
behold , seven other cattle came up after them out of the river , ugly and thin , and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river .
behold , seven heads of grain , thin and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears . Pharaoh awoke , and behold , it was a dream .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's magicians and wise men . Pharaoh told them his dreams , but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh .
Pharaoh was angry with his servants , and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , me and the chief Baker .
we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he . we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
there was with us there a young man , a Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams . to each man according to his dream he interpreted .
it happened , as he interpreted to us , so it was : he restored me to my office , and he hanged him . "
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon . he shaved himself , changed his clothing , and came in to Pharaoh .
Pharaoh spoke to Joseph , " In my dream , behold , I stood on the brink of the river :
and behold , there came up out of the river seven cattle , fat and sleek . they fed in the marsh grass ,
and behold , seven other cattle came up after them , poor and very ugly and thin , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness .
I saw in my dream , and behold , seven heads of grain came up on one stalk , full and good :
and behold , seven heads of grain , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
the seven good cattle are seven years ; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years . the dream is one .
the seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years , and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind ; they will be seven years of famine .
that is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh . what God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh .
behold , there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt .
there will arise after them seven years of famine , and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt . the famine will consume the land ,
and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows ; for it will be very grievous .
" now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man , and set him over the land of Egypt .
let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint overseers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt 's produce in the seven plenteous years .
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not perish through the famine . "
the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
Pharaoh said to his servants , " Can we find such a one as this , a man in whom is the Spirit of God ? "
you shall be over my house , and according to your word will all my people be ruled . only in the throne I will be greater than you . "
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " behold , I have set you over all the land of Egypt . "
Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in robes of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ,
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had . they cried before him , " bow the knee ! " he set him over all the land of Egypt .
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " I am Pharaoh , and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt . "
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea , very much , until he stopped counting , for it was without number .
to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera priest of On , bore to him .
Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh , " For , " he said , " God has made me forget all my toil , and all my father 's house . "
the name of the second , he called Ephraim : " for God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction . "
the seven years of plenty , that were in the land of Egypt , came to an end .
the seven years of famine began to come , just as Joseph had said . there was famine in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
when all the land of Egypt was famished , the people cried to Pharaoh for bread , and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians , " Go to Joseph . what he says to you , do . "
the famine was over all the surface of the earth . Joseph opened all the store houses , and sold to the Egyptians . the famine was severe in the land of Egypt .
now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt , and Jacob said to his sons , " Why do you look at one another ? "
but Jacob didn 't send Benjamin , Joseph 's brother , with his brothers ; for he said , " Lest perhaps harm happen to him . "
Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them , and said to them , " You are spies ! you have come to see the nakedness of the land . "
by this you shall be tested . by the life of Pharaoh , you shall not go out from here , unless your youngest brother comes here .
if you are honest men , then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison ; but you go , carry grain for the famine of your houses .
Reuben answered them , saying , " Didn 't I tell you , saying , ' Don 't sin against the child , ' and you wouldn 't listen ? therefore also , behold , his blood is required . "
they didn 't know that Joseph understood them ; for there was an interpreter between them .
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain , and to restore each man 's money into his sack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
they loaded their donkeys with their grain , and departed from there .
as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place , he saw his money . behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .
they came to Jacob their father , to the land of Canaan , and told him all that had happened to them , saying ,
" the man , the lord of the land , spoke roughly with us , and took us for spies of the country .
we are twelve brothers , sons of our father ; one is no more , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan . '
it happened as they emptied their sacks , that behold , each man 's bundle of money was in his sack . when they and their father saw their bundles of money , they were afraid .
it happened , when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said to them , " Go again , buy us a little more food . "
if you 'll send our brother with us , we 'll go down and buy you food ,
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
for if we hadn 't delayed , surely we would have returned a second time by now . "
and take double money in your hand , and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks . perhaps it was an oversight .
the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and got up , went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
when Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the steward of his house , " Bring the men into the house , and butcher an animal , and prepare ; for the men will dine with me at noon . "
the man did as Joseph commanded , and the man brought the men to Joseph 's house .
they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they spoke to him at the door of the house ,
we have brought down other money in our hand to buy food . we don 't know who put our money in our sacks . "
the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet . he gave their donkeys fodder .
Joseph hurried , for his heart yearned over his brother ; and he sought a place to weep . he entered into his room , and wept there .
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyptians , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyptians don 't eat bread with the Hebrews , for that is an abomination to the Egyptians .
they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth , and the men marveled one with another .
he sent portions to them from before him , but Benjamin 's portion was five times as much as any of theirs . they drank , and were merry with him .
put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack 's mouth of the youngest , with his grain money . " he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their donkeys .
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan . how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord 's house ?
with whomever of your servants it is found , let him die , and we also will be my lord 's bondservants . "
he searched , beginning with the eldest , and ending at the youngest . the cup was found in Benjamin 's sack .
then they tore their clothes , and each man loaded his donkey , and returned to the city .
Judah and his brothers came to Joseph 's house , and he was still there . they fell on the ground before him .
we said to my lord , ' The boy can 't leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die . '
you said to your servants , ' Unless your youngest brother comes down with you , you will see my face no more . '
it happened when we came up to your servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
we said , ' We can 't go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
and the one went out from me , and I said , " surely he is torn in pieces " ; and I haven 't seen him since .
if you take this one also from me , and harm happens to him , you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol . '
for your servant became collateral for the boy to my father , saying , ' If I don 't bring him to you , then I will bear the blame to my father forever . '
now therefore , please let your servant stay instead of the boy , a bondservant to my lord ; and let the boy go up with his brothers .
for how will I go up to my father , if the boy isn 't with me ? --lest I see the evil that will come on my father . "
then Joseph couldn 't control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cried , " Cause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
Joseph said to his brothers , " I am Joseph ! does my father still live ? " his brothers couldn 't answer him ; for they were terrified at his presence .
Joseph said to his brothers , " Come near to me , please . " they came near . " he said , I am Joseph , your brother , whom you sold into Egypt .
now don 't be grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that you sold me here , for God sent me before you to preserve life .
for these two years the famine has been in the land , and there are yet five years , in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest .
God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth , and to save you alive by a great deliverance .
hurry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lord of all Egypt . come down to me . Don 't wait .
there I will nourish you ; for there are yet five years of famine ; lest you come to poverty , you , and your household , and all that you have . " '
behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin , that it is my mouth that speaks to you .
you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that you have seen . you shall hurry and bring my father down here . "
he fell on his brother Benjamin 's neck , and wept , and Benjamin wept on his neck .
he kissed all his brothers , and wept on them . after that his brothers talked with him .
the report of it was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , " Joseph 's brothers have come . " it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " Tell your brothers , ' Do this . load your animals , and go , travel to the land of Canaan .
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the fat of the land . '
also , don 't concern yourselves about your belongings , for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours . "
the sons of Israel did so . Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
he gave each one of them changes of clothing , but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing .
he sent the following to his father : ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way .
so he sent his brothers away , and they departed . he said to them , " See that you don 't quarrel on the way . "
they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan , to Jacob their father .
I will go down with you into Egypt . I will also surely bring you up again . Joseph will close your eyes . "
Jacob rose up from Beersheba , and the sons of Israel carried Jacob , their father , their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
they took their livestock , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt--Jacob , and all his seed with him ,
these are the names of the children of Israel , who came into Egypt , Jacob and his sons : Reuben , Jacob 's firstborn .
these are the sons of Leah , whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram , with his daughter Dinah . all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty @-@ three .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob , even sixteen souls .
to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of On , bore to him .
these are the sons of Rachel , who were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
these are the sons of Bilhah , whom Laban gave to Rachel , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob : all the souls were seven .
all the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt , who were his direct descendants , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives , all the souls were sixty @-@ six .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two souls . all the souls of the house of Jacob , who came into Egypt , were seventy .
he sent Judah before him to Joseph , to show the way before him to Goshen , and they came into the land of Goshen .
these men are shepherds , for they have been keepers of livestock , and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have . '
it will happen , when Pharaoh summons you , and will say , ' What is your occupation ? '
Joseph brought in Jacob , his father , and set him before Pharaoh , and Jacob blessed Pharaoh .
Jacob blessed Pharaoh , and went out from the presence of Pharaoh .
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
Joseph nourished his father , his brothers , and all of his father 's household , with bread , according to their families .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the grain which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
so Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh , for every man of the Egyptians sold his field , because the famine was severe on them , and the land became Pharaoh 's .
as for the people , he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it .
then Joseph said to the people , " behold , I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh . behold , here is seed for you , and you shall sow the land .
they said , " You have saved our lives ! let us find favor in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh 's servants . "
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth . only the land of the priests alone didn 't become Pharaoh 's .
Israel lived in the land of Egypt , in the land of Goshen ; and they got themselves possessions therein , and were fruitful , and multiplied exceedingly .
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years . so the days of Jacob , the years of his life , were one hundred forty @-@ seven years .
but when I sleep with my fathers , you shall carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their burying place . " he said , " I will do as you have said . "
it happened after these things , that someone said to Joseph , " behold , your father is sick . " he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
someone told Jacob , and said , " behold , your son Joseph comes to you , " and Israel strengthened himself , and sat on the bed .
now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt , are mine ; Ephraim and Manasseh , even as Reuben and Simeon , will be mine .
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yours . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he couldn 't see . he brought them near to him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it on Ephraim 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Manasseh 's head , guiding his hands knowingly , for Manasseh was the firstborn .
Israel said to Joseph , " behold , I am dying , but God will be with you , and bring you again to the land of your fathers .
moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow . "
Jacob called to his sons , and said : " gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come .
boiling over as water , you shall not excel ; because you went up to your father 's bed , then defiled it . he went up to my couch .
my soul , don 't come into their council . my glory , don 't be united to their assembly ; for in their anger they killed men . in their self @-@ will they hamstrung cattle .
Cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel . I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
" Judah , your brothers will praise you . your hand will be on the neck of your enemies . your father 's sons will bow down before you .
the scepter will not depart from Judah , nor the ruler 's staff from between his feet , until he comes to whom it belongs . to him will the obedience of the peoples be .
binding his foal to the vine , his donkey 's colt to the choice vine ; he has washed his garments in wine , his robes in the blood of grapes .
" Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea . he will be for a haven of ships . his border will be on Sidon .
Dan will be a serpent in the way , an adder in the path , That Bites the horse 's heels , so that his Rider falls backward .
but his bow remained strong . the arms of his hands were made strong , by the hands of the mighty One of Jacob , ( from there is the shepherd , the stone of Israel ) ,
" Benjamin is a ravenous wolf . in the morning he will devour the prey . at evening he will divide the spoil . "
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel , and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them . he blessed everyone according to his blessing .
there they buried Abraham and Sarah , his wife . there they buried Isaac and Rebekah , his wife , and there I buried Leah :
the field and the cave that is therein , which was purchased from the children of Heth . "
when Jacob made an end of charging his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the spirit , and was gathered to his people .
Joseph fell on his father 's face , wept on him , and kissed him .
Joseph commanded his servants , the physicians , to embalm his father ; and the physicians embalmed Israel .
forty days were fulfilled for him , for that is how many the days it takes to embalm . the Egyptians wept for him for seventy days .
Joseph went up to bury his father ; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father 's house . only their little ones , their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
there went up with him both chariots and horsemen . it was a very great company .
they came to the threshing floor of Atad , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation . he mourned for his father seven days .
Joseph returned into Egypt--he , and his brothers , and all that went up with him to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
his brothers also went and fell down before his face ; and they said , " behold , we are your servants . "
as for you , you meant evil against me , but God meant it for good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save many people alive .
now therefore don 't be afraid . I will nourish you and your little ones . " he comforted them , and spoke kindly to them .
Joseph lived in Egypt , he , and his father 's house . Joseph lived one hundred ten years .
Joseph saw Ephraim 's children to the third generation . the children also of Machir , the son of Manasseh , were born on Joseph 's knees .
so Joseph died , being one hundred ten years old , and they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in Egypt .
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jacob ) :
all the souls who came out of Jacob 's body were seventy souls , and Joseph was in Egypt already .
the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and grew exceedingly mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and the more they spread out . they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
the Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve ,
the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew Midwives , of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah ,
but the Midwives feared God , and didn 't do what the king of Egypt commanded them , but saved the baby boys alive .
the Midwives said to Pharaoh , " Because the Hebrew women aren 't like the Egyptian women ; for they are vigorous , and give birth before the midwife comes to them . "
God dealt well with the Midwives , and the people multiplied , and grew very mighty .
a man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife .
when she could no longer hide him , she took a papyrus basket for him , and coated it with tar and with pitch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the reeds by the river 's bank .
Pharaoh 's daughter came down to bathe at the river . her maidens walked along by the riverside . she saw the basket among the reeds , and sent her handmaid to get it .
then his sister said to Pharaoh 's daughter , " Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for you ? "
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to kill Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and lived in the land of Midian , and he sat down by a well .
now the priest of Midian had seven daughters . they came and drew water , and filled the troughs to water their father 's flock .
the shepherds came and drove them away ; but Moses stood up and helped them , and watered their flock .
she bore a son , and he named him Gershom , for he said , " I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land . "
it happened in the course of those many days , that the king of Egypt died , and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage , and they cried , and their cry came up to God because of the bondage .
God heard their groaning , and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham , with Isaac , and with Jacob .
he said , " Don 't come close . take your sandals off of your feet , for the place you are standing on is holy ground . "
moreover he said , " I am the God of your father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . " Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look at God .
Yahweh said , " I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt , and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters , for I know their sorrows .
now , behold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them .
come now therefore , and I will send you to Pharaoh , that you may bring my people , the children of Israel , out of Egypt . "
Moses said to God , " Who am I , that I should go to Pharaoh , and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt ? "
I know that the king of Egypt won 't give you permission to go , no , not by a mighty hand .
I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst , and after that he will let you go .
I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , and it will happen that when you go , you shall not go empty @-@ handed .
Moses answered , " But , behold , they will not believe me , nor listen to my voice ; for they will say , ' Yahweh has not appeared to you . ' "
he said , " throw it on the ground . " he threw it on the ground , and it became a snake ; and Moses ran away from it .
he said , " Put your hand inside your cloak again . " he put his hand inside his cloak again , and when he took it out of his cloak , behold , it had turned again as his other flesh .
" it will happen , if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
he said , " Oh , Lord , please send someone else . "
he will be your spokesman to the people ; and it will happen , that he will be to you a mouth , and you will be to him as God .
Yahweh said to Moses in Midian , " Go , return into Egypt ; for all the men who sought your life are dead . "
Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them on a donkey , and he returned to the land of Egypt . Moses took God 's rod in his hand .
so he let him alone . then she said , " You are a bridegroom of blood , " because of the circumcision .
Yahweh said to Aaron , " Go into the wilderness to meet Moses . " he went , and met him on God 's mountain , and kissed him .
Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which he had sent him , and all the signs with which he had instructed him .
Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel .
Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
the people believed , and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel , and that he had seen their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshiped .
afterward Moses and Aaron came , and said to Pharaoh , " This is what Yahweh , the God of Israel , says , ' Let my people go , that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness . ' "
the king of Egypt said to them , " Why do you , Moses and Aaron , take the people from their work ? get back to your burdens ! "
Pharaoh said , " behold , the people of the land are now many , and you make them rest from their burdens . "
" you shall no longer give the people straw to make brick , as before . let them go and gather straw for themselves .
let heavier work be laid on the men , that they may labor therein ; and don 't let them pay any attention to lying words . "
the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spoke to the people , saying , " This is what Pharaoh says : ' I will not give you straw .
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw .
the officers of the children of Israel , whom Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Why haven 't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today , in making brick as before ? "
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh , saying , " Why do you deal this way with your servants ?
go therefore now , and work , for no straw shall be given to you , yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks ! "
the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble , when it was said , " You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks ! "
they met Moses and Aaron , who stood in the way , as they came out from Pharaoh :
for since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name , he has brought trouble on this people ; neither have you delivered your people at all . "
and I appeared to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , as God Almighty ; but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them .
I have also established my Covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their travels , in which they lived as aliens .
moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage , and I have remembered my Covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God , who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
Moses spoke so to the children of Israel , but they didn 't listen to Moses for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these are the heads of their fathers ' houses . the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel : Hanoch , and Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi ; these are the families of Reuben .
the sons of Simeon : Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations : Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari ; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty @-@ seven years .
the sons of Kohath : Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel ; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty @-@ three years .
the sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . these are the families of the Levites according to their generations .
Amram took Jochebed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty @-@ seven years .
Aaron took Elisheba , the daughter of Amminadab , the sister of Nahshon , as his wife ; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
the sons of Korah : Assir , and Elkanah , and Abiasaph ; these are the families of the Korahites .
Eleazar Aaron 's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife ; and she bore him Phinehas . these are the heads of the fathers ' houses of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom Yahweh said , " Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies . "
these are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Moses and Aaron .
it happened on the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt ,
you shall speak all that I command you ; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt .
but Pharaoh will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh , when I stretch out my hand on Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them . "
Moses and Aaron did so . as Yahweh commanded them , so they did .
Moses was eighty years old , and Aaron eighty @-@ three years old , when they spoke to Pharaoh .
then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers . they also , the magicians of Egypt , did the same thing with their enchantments .
for they each cast down their rods , and they became Serpents : but Aaron 's rod swallowed up their rods .
the fish that are in the river shall die , and the river shall become foul ; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river . " ' "
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became foul , and the Egyptians couldn 't drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
the magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments ; and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he didn 't listen to them ; as Yahweh had spoken .
Pharaoh turned and went into his house , and he didn 't even take this to heart .
all the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink ; for they couldn 't drink of the water of the river .
if you refuse to let them go , behold , I will plague all your borders with frogs :
and the frogs shall come up both on you , and on your people , and on all your servants . ' "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Tell Aaron , ' Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers , over the streams , and over the pools , and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt . ' "
Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
the magicians did the same thing with their enchantments , and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt .
the frogs shall depart from you , and from your houses , and from your servants , and from your people . they shall remain in the river only . "
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses , and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the courts , and out of the fields .
but when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite , he hardened his heart , and didn 't listen to them , as Yahweh had spoken .
the magicians tried with their enchantments to produce lice , but they couldn 't . there were lice on man , and on animal .
I will put a division between my people and your people : by tomorrow shall this sign be . " ' "
we will go three days ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to Yahweh our God , as he shall command us . "
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses , and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people . there remained not one .
for if you refuse to let them go , and hold them still ,
behold , the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field , on the horses , on the donkeys , on the camels , on the herds , and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence .
Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt ; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel . " ' "
Yahweh did that thing on the next day ; and all the livestock of Egypt died , but of the livestock of the children of Israel , not one died .
Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead . but the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn , and he didn 't let the people go .
Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron , " Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh .
it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "
they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky ; and it became a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal .
the magicians couldn 't stand before Moses because of the boils ; for the boils were on the magicians , and on all the Egyptians .
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh , and he didn 't listen to them , as Yahweh had spoken to Moses .
for this time I will send all my plagues against your heart , against your officials , and against your people ; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth .
for now I would have stretched out my hand , and struck you and your people with pestilence , and you would have been cut off from the earth ;
but indeed for this cause I have made you stand : to show you my power , and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth ;
as you still exalt yourself against my people , that you won 't let them go .
those who feared the word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses .
whoever didn 't respect the word of Yahweh left his servants and his livestock in the field .
Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens , and Yahweh sent Thunder , hail , and lightning flashed down to the earth . Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt .
so there was very severe hail , and lightning mixed with the hail , such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the hail struck every herb of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
only in the land of Goshen , where the children of Israel were , there was no hail .
Pharaoh sent , and called for Moses and Aaron , and said to them , " I have sinned this time . Yahweh is righteous , and I and my people are wicked .
pray to Yahweh ; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail . I will let you go , and you shall stay no longer . "
but as for you and your servants , I know that you don 't yet fear Yahweh God . "
the flax and the barley were struck , for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was in bloom .
but the wheat and the spelt were not struck , for they had not grown up .
Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands to Yahweh ; and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured on the earth .
when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go , just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go in to Pharaoh , for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I may show these my signs in their midst ,
or else , if you refuse to let my people go , behold , tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country ,
Pharaoh 's servants said to him , " How long will this man be a snare to us ? let the men go , that they may serve Yahweh , their God . Don 't you yet know that Egypt is destroyed ? "
Moses said , " We will go with our young and with our old ; with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh . "
not so ! go now you who are men , and serve Yahweh ; for that is what you desire ! " they were driven out from Pharaoh 's presence .
the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very grievous . before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste , and he said , " I have sinned against Yahweh your God , and against you .
Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind , which took up the locusts , and drove them into the Red Sea . there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt .
but Yahweh hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand toward the sky , that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt , even darkness which may be felt . "
Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky , and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days .
they didn 't see one another , neither did anyone rise from his place for three days ; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
Pharaoh said to him , " Get away from me ! be careful to see my face no more ; for in the day you see my face you shall die ! "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh , and on Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go . when he lets you go , he will surely thrust you out altogether .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne , even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there has not been , nor shall be any more .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Pharaoh won 't listen to you , that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt . "
Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh , and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and he didn 't let the children of Israel go out of his land .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt , saying ,
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male a year old . you shall take it from the sheep , or from the goats :
and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the Congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening .
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
they shall eat the flesh in that night , roasted with fire , and unleavened bread . they shall eat it with bitter herbs .
Don 't eat it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but roasted with fire ; with its head , its legs and its inner parts .
you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire .
this is how you shall eat it : with your belt on your waist , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in haste : it is Yahweh 's Passover .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever .
then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said to them , " Draw out , and take lambs according to your families , and kill the Passover .
it shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you , according as he has promised , that you shall keep this service .
it will happen , when your children ask you , ' What do you mean by this service ? '
the children of Israel went and did so ; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron , so they did .
Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
he called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , " Rise up , get out from among my people , both you and the children of Israel ; and go , serve Yahweh , as you have said !
take both your flocks and your herds , as you have said , and be gone ; and bless me also ! "
the Egyptians were urgent with the people , to send them out of the land in haste , for they said , " We are all dead men . "
the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders .
the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing .
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they let them have what they asked . they despoiled the Egyptians .
they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it wasn 't leavened , because they were thrust out of Egypt , and couldn 't wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years .
it happened at the end of four hundred thirty years , even the same day it happened , that all the armies of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt . this is that night of Yahweh , to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations .
but every man 's servant who is bought for money , when you have circumcised him , then shall he eat of it .
one law shall be to him who is born at home , and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you . "
all the children of Israel did so . as Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron , so they did .
it happened the same day , that Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh .
Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days ; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you , neither shall yeast be seen with you , in all your borders .
you shall tell your son in that day , saying , ' It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt . '
" it shall be , when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite , as he swore to you and to your fathers , and shall give it you ,
that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb , and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal . the males shall be Yahweh 's .
it shall be for a sign on your hand , and for symbols between your eyes : for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt . "
but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt .
they took their journey from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
the pillar of cloud by day , and the pillar of fire by night , didn 't depart from before the people .
Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , ' They are entangled in the land . the wilderness has shut them in . '
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
when Pharaoh drew near , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and behold , the Egyptians were marching after them ; and they were very afraid . the children of Israel cried out to Yahweh .
lift up your rod , and stretch out your hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground .
the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh , over his chariots , and over his horsemen . "
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them into the midst of the sea : all of Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
it happened in the morning watch , that Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud , and confused the Egyptian army .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand over the sea , that the waters may come again on the Egyptians , on their chariots , and on their horsemen . "
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it . Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
the waters returned , and covered the chariots and the horsemen , even all Pharaoh 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .
but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore .
then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh , and said , " I will sing to Yahweh , for he has triumphed gloriously . the horse and his Rider he has thrown into the sea .
Yah is my strength and song . he has become my salvation . this is my God , and I will praise him ; my father 's God , and I will exalt him .
he has cast Pharaoh 's chariots and his army into the sea . his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea .
the deeps cover them . they went down into the depths like a stone .
in the greatness of your excellency , you overthrow those who rise up against you . you send forth your wrath . it consumes them as stubble .
with the blast of your nostrils , the waters were piled up . the floods stood upright as a heap . the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , ' I will pursue . I will overtake . I will divide the spoil . my desire shall be satisfied on them . I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them . '
you blew with your wind . the sea covered them . they sank like lead in the mighty waters .
" you , in your loving kindness , have led the people that you have redeemed . you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation .
the peoples have heard . they tremble . pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia .
then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed . Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab . all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away .
terror and dread falls on them . by the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone-- until your people pass over , Yahweh , until the people pass over who you have purchased .
Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a tambourine in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances .
Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
when they came to Marah , they couldn 't drink from the waters of Marah , for they were bitter . therefore its name was called Marah .
the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness ;
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , " At evening , then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
and in the morning , then you shall see the glory of Yahweh ; because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh . who are we , that you murmur against us ? "
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud .
it happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp ; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp .
when the dew that lay had gone , behold , on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing , small as the Frost on the ground .
when they measured it with an Omer , he who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little had no lack . they gathered every man according to his eating .
notwithstanding they didn 't listen to Moses , but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and became foul : and Moses was angry with them .
they gathered it morning by morning , everyone according to his eating . when the sun grew hot , it melted .
it happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for each one , and all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses .
they laid it up until the morning , as Moses asked , and it didn 't become foul , neither was there any worm in it .
six days you shall gather it , but on the seventh day is the Sabbath . in it there shall be none . "
it happened on the seventh day , that some of the people went out to gather , and they found none .
behold , because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath , therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days . everyone stay in his place . let no one go out of his place on the seventh day . "
the house of Israel called its name Manna , and it was like coriander seed , white ; and its taste was like wafers with honey .
the children of Israel ate the manna forty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan .
now an Omer is the tenth part of an ephah .
all the Congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of sin , by their journeys , according to Yahweh 's commandment , and encamped in Rephidim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
the people were thirsty for water there ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us , our children , and our livestock with thirst ? "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Walk on before the people , and take the elders of Israel with you , and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile , and go .
he called the name of the place Massah , and Meribah , because the children of Israel quarreled , and because they tested Yahweh , saying , " Is Yahweh among us , or not ? "
Moses said to Joshua , " Choose men for us , and go out , fight with Amalek . tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God 's rod in my hand . "
so Joshua did as Moses had told him , and fought with Amalek ; and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
it happened , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
the name of the other was Eliezer , for he said , " My father 's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh 's sword . "
he said to Moses , " I , your father @-@ in @-@ law Jethro , have come to you with your wife , and her two sons with her . "
Moses went out to meet his father @-@ in @-@ law , and bowed and kissed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Moses told his father @-@ in @-@ law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , all the hardships that had come on them on the way , and how Yahweh delivered them .
Jethro rejoiced for all the Goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians .
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God . Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law before God .
it happened on the next day , that Moses sat to judge the people , and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening .
when they have a matter , they come to me , and I judge between a man and his neighbor , and I make them know the statutes of God , and his laws . "
Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law said to him , " The thing that you do is not good .
you will surely wear away , both you , and this people that is with you ; for the thing is too heavy for you . you are not able to perform it yourself alone .
listen now to my voice . I will give you counsel , and God be with you . you represent the people before God , and bring the causes to God .
you shall teach them the statutes and the laws , and shall show them the way in which they must walk , and the work that they must do .
if you will do this thing , and God commands you so , then you will be able to endure , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
so Moses listened to the voice of his father @-@ in @-@ law , and did all that he had said .
Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
they judged the people at all times . they brought the hard causes to Moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
Moses let his father @-@ in @-@ law depart , and he went his way into his own land .
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai .
when they had departed from Rephidim , and had come to the wilderness of Sinai , they encamped in the wilderness ; and there Israel encamped before the mountain .
Moses went up to God , and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians , and how I bore you on eagles ' wings , and brought you to myself .
now therefore , if you will indeed obey my voice , and keep my Covenant , then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples ; for all the earth is mine ;
Moses came and called for the elders of the people , and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him .
all the people answered together , and said , " All that Yahweh has spoken we will do . " Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh .
and be ready against the third day ; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai .
you shall set bounds to the people all around , saying , ' Be careful that you don 't go up onto the mountain , or touch its border . whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death .
Moses went down from the mountain to the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes .
Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God ; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain .
Mount Sinai , all it , smoked , because Yahweh descended on it in fire ; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mountain quaked greatly .
when the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder , Moses spoke , and God answered him by a voice .
Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai , to the top of the mountain . Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
let the priests also , who come near to Yahweh , sanctify themselves , lest Yahweh break forth on them . "
Yahweh said to him , " Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you , but don 't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh , lest he break forth on them . "
" I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
" you shall not make for yourselves an idol , nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
" you shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain , for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain .
for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that is in them , and rested the seventh day ; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day , and made it holy .
all the people perceived the thunderings , the lightnings , the sound of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they trembled , and stayed at a distance .
they said to Moses , " Speak with us yourself , and we will listen ; but don 't let God speak with us , lest we die . "
the people stayed at a distance , and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was .
Yahweh said to Moses , " This is what you shall tell the children of Israel : ' you yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
if you make me an altar of stone , you shall not build it of cut stones ; for if you lift up your tool on it , you have polluted it .
neither shall you go up by steps to my altar , that your nakedness may not be exposed to it . '
" now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them .

if his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters , the wife and her children shall be her master 's , and he shall go out by himself .

" if men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone , or with his fist , and he doesn 't die , but is confined to bed ;

" if a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod , and he dies under his hand , he shall surely be punished .

" if a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep , and it is stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief is found , he shall pay double .
if the thief isn 't found , then the master of the house shall come near to God , to find out if he hasn 't put his hand to his neighbor 's goods .
" if a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey , an ox , a sheep , or any animal to keep , and it dies or is injured , or driven away , no man seeing it ;

now therefore leave me alone , that my wrath may burn hot against them , and that I may consume them ; and I will make of you a great nation . "
Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people .
Moses turned , and went down from the mountain , with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand ; tablets that were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other they were written .
the tablets were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , engraved on the tables .
when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said to Moses , " There is the noise of war in the camp . "
when Moses saw that the people had broken loose , ( for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies ) ,
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , " Whoever is on Yahweh 's side , come to me ! " all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him .
the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
it happened on the next day , that Moses said to the people , " You have sinned a great sin . now I will go up to Yahweh . perhaps I shall make Atonement for your sin . "
yet now , if you will , forgive their sin--and if not , please blot me out of your book which you have written . "
now go , lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you . behold , my angel shall go before you . nevertheless in the day when I punish , I will punish them for their sin . "
when the people heard this evil news , they mourned : and no one put on his jewelry .
the children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward .
it happened that when Moses went out to the tent , that all the people rose up , and stood , everyone at their tent door , and watched Moses , until he had gone into the tent .
it happened , when Moses entered into the tent , that the pillar of cloud descended , stood at the door of the tent , and spoke with Moses .
all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent , and all the people rose up and worshiped , everyone at their tent door .
Yahweh said to Moses , " I will do this thing also that you have spoken ; for you have found favor in my sight , and I know you by name . "
he said , " You cannot see my face , for man may not see me and live . "
it will happen , while my glory passes by , that I will put you in a cleft of the rock , and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by ;
then I will take away my hand , and you will see my back ; but my face shall not be seen . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Chisel two stone tablets like the first : and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets , which you broke .
be ready by the morning , and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai , and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain .
no one shall come up with you ; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain ; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountain . "
he chiseled two tablets of stone like the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up to Mount Sinai , as Yahweh had commanded him , and took in his hand two stone tablets .
Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth , and worshiped .
observe that which I command you this day . behold , I drive out before you the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
be careful , lest you make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going , lest it be for a snare in the midst of you :
but you shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars , and you shall cut down their Asherim ;
for you shall worship no other god : for Yahweh , whose name is Jealous , is a Jealous God .
" Don 't make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land , lest they play the prostitute after their gods , and sacrifice to their gods , and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice ;
and you take of their daughters to your sons , and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods , and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods .
" six days you shall work , but on the seventh day you shall rest : in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest .
" you shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of harvest at the year 's end .
three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh , the God of Israel .
for I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders ; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh , your God , three times in the year .
" you shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning .
" you shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God . " you shall not boil a young goat in its mother 's milk . "
he was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights ; he neither ate bread , nor drank water . he wrote on the tablets the words of the Covenant , the ten commandments .
when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come near him .
Moses called to them , and Aaron and all the rulers of the Congregation returned to him ; and Moses spoke to them .
afterward all the children of Israel came near , and he gave them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai .
when Moses was done speaking with them , he put a veil on his face .
but when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him , he took the veil off , until he came out ; and he came out , and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
the children of Israel saw Moses ' face , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the veil on his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
Moses assembled all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and said to them , " These are the words which Yahweh has commanded , that you should do them .
'Six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you , a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh : whoever does any work in it shall be put to death .
you shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the Sabbath day . ' "
Moses spoke to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yahweh commanded , saying ,
" ' let every wise @-@ hearted man among you come , and make all that Yahweh has commanded :
the tabernacle , its outer covering , its roof , its clasps , its boards , its bars , its pillars , and its sockets ;
the Ark , and its poles , the mercy seat , the veil of the screen ;
the lampstand also for the light , with its vessels , its lamps , and the oil for the light ;
and the altar of incense with its poles , the anointing oil , the sweet incense , the screen for the door , at the door of the tabernacle ;
the altar of burnt offering , with its grating of brass , it poles , and all its vessels , the basin and its base ;
the hangings of the court , its pillars , their sockets , and the screen for the gate of the court ;
the pins of the tabernacle , the pins of the court , and their cords ;
the finely worked garments , for ministering in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office . ' "
all the Congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses .

all the wise men , who performed all the work of the sanctuary , each came from his work which they did .

" speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' If anyone sins unintentionally , in any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done , and does any one of them :
if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people , then let him offer for his sin , which he has sinned , a young bull without blemish to Yahweh for a sin offering .

he shall carry forth the bull outside the camp , and burn it as he burned the first bull . it is the sin offering for the assembly .
" ' when a ruler sins , and unwittingly does any one of all the things which Yahweh his God has commanded not to be done , and is guilty ;
if his sin , in which he has sinned , is made known to him , he shall bring as his offering a goat , a male without blemish .
he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before Yahweh . it is a sin offering .
all its fat he shall burn on the altar , like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings ; and the priest shall make Atonement for him concerning his sin , and he will be forgiven .

this is the anointing portion of Aaron , and the anointing portion of his sons , out of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister to Yahweh in the priest 's office ;
which Yahweh commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he anointed them . it is their portion forever throughout their generations .
which Yahweh commanded Moses in Mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their offerings to Yahweh , in the wilderness of Sinai .
Moses did as Yahweh commanded him ; and the Congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of Meeting .
Moses said to the Congregation , " This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded to be done . "
Moses brought Aaron and his sons , and washed them with water .
he placed the breastplate on him ; and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim .
he set the turban on his head ; and on the turban , in front , he set the golden plate , the holy crown ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
Moses took the anointing oil , and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it , and sanctified them .
he sprinkled it on the altar seven times , and anointed the altar and all its vessels , and the basin and its base , to sanctify them .
he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron 's head , and anointed him , to sanctify him .
he brought the bull of the sin offering , and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering .
he took all the fat that was on the innards , and the cover of the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat ; and Moses burned it on the altar .
but the bull , and its skin , and its flesh , and its Dung , he burned with fire outside the camp ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
he presented the ram of the burnt offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram .
he cut the ram into its pieces ; and Moses burned the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
he presented the other ram , the ram of consecration : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram .
he put all these in Aaron 's hands and in his sons ' hands , and waved them for a wave offering before Yahweh .
what remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire .
you shall not go out from the door of the tent of Meeting seven days , until the days of your consecration are fulfilled : for he shall consecrate you seven days .
what has been done this day , so Yahweh has commanded to do , to make Atonement for you .
you shall stay at the door of the tent of Meeting day and night seven days , and keep Yahweh 's command , that you don 't die : for so I am commanded . "
it happened on the eighth day , that Moses called Aaron and his sons , and the elders of Israel ;
and he said to Aaron , " Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering , without blemish , and offer them before Yahweh .
they brought what Moses commanded before the tent of Meeting : and all the Congregation drew near and stood before Yahweh .
Moses said , " This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do : and the glory of Yahweh shall appear to you . "
so Aaron drew near to the altar , and killed the calf of the sin offering , which was for himself .
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the cover from the liver of the sin offering , he burned upon the altar ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp .
he killed the burnt offering ; and Aaron 's sons delivered the blood to him , and he sprinkled it around on the altar .
they delivered the burnt offering to him , piece by piece , and the head : and he burned them upon the altar .
he washed the innards and the legs , and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar .
he presented the people 's offering , and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people , and killed it , and offered it for sin , like the first .
he presented the burnt offering , and offered it according to the ordinance .
he presented the meal offering , and filled his hand from there , and burned it upon the altar , besides the burnt offering of the morning .
he also killed the bull and the ram , the sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and Aaron 's sons delivered to him the blood , which he sprinkled around on the altar ,
and the fat of the bull and of the ram , the fat tail , and that which covers the innards , and the kidneys , and the cover of the liver :
and they put the fat upon the breasts , and he burned the fat on the altar :
and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Yahweh , as Moses commanded .
Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people , and blessed them ; and he came down from offering the sin offering , and the burnt offering , and the peace offerings .
Moses and Aaron went into the tent of Meeting , and came out , and blessed the people : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people .
there came forth fire from before Yahweh , and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar : and when all the people saw it , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
Nadab and Abihu , the sons of Aaron , each took his censer , and put fire in it , and laid incense on it , and offered strange fire before Yahweh , which he had not commanded them .
Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said to them , " Draw near , carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp . "
so they drew near , and carried them in their coats out of the camp , as Moses had said .
and that you are to make a distinction between the holy and the common , and between the unclean and the clean ;
and that you are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses . "
and you shall eat it in a holy place , because it is your portion , and your sons ' portion , of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire : for so I am commanded .
behold , its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary : you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary , as I commanded . "
when Moses heard that , it was pleasing in his sight .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying to them ,
" speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' These are the living things which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth .
whatever parts the hoof , and is cloven @-@ footed , and chews the cud among the animals , that you may eat .

" count the children of Levi by their fathers ' houses , by their families . you shall count every male from a month old and upward . "
Moses numbered them according to the word of Yahweh , as he was commanded .
these were the sons of Levi by their names : Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari .

those who were numbered of them , according to the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , even those who were numbered of them were seven thousand five hundred .

the appointed duty of the sons of Merari shall be the tabernacle 's boards , its bars , its pillars , its sockets , all its instruments , all its service ,

Yahweh said to Moses , " Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward , and take the number of their names .
" take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel , and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock ; and the Levites shall be mine . I am Yahweh .
for the redemption of the two hundred seventy @-@ three of the firstborn of the children of Israel , who exceed the number of the Levites ,
you shall take five shekels apiece for each one ; after the shekel of the sanctuary you shall take them ( the shekel is twenty gerahs ) :
and you shall give the money , with which their remainder is redeemed , to Aaron and to his sons . "
Moses took the redemption money from those who exceeded the number of those who were redeemed by the Levites ;
from the firstborn of the children of Israel he took the money , one thousand three hundred sixty @-@ five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
" this is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of Meeting , the most holy things .

" take a census of the sons of Gershon also , by their fathers ' houses , by their families ;
you shall count them from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old ; all who enter in to wait on the service , to do the work in the tent of Meeting .
" this is the service of the families of the Gershonites , in serving and in bearing burdens :
at the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites , in all their burden , and in all their service ; and you shall appoint their duty to them in all their responsibilities .
this is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of Meeting : and their duty shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
" as for the sons of Merari , you shall number them by their families , by their fathers ' houses ;

this is the duty of their burden , according to all their service in the tent of Meeting : the tabernacle 's boards , its bars , its pillars , its sockets ,
those who were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred fifty .
even those who were numbered of them , by their families , by their fathers ' houses , were two thousand six hundred thirty .
these are those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon , all who served in the tent of Meeting , whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh .
even those who were numbered of them by their families , were three thousand two hundred .
these are those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari , whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses .

" command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper , and everyone who has an issue , and whoever is unclean by the dead .
both you shall put male and female outside of the camp ; that they not defile their camp , in the midst of which I dwell . "
the children of Israel did so , and put them out outside of the camp ; as Yahweh spoke to Moses , so did the children of Israel .
every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they present to the priest , shall be his .
every man 's holy things shall be his : whatever any man gives the priest , it shall be his . ' "
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them : ' if any man 's wife goes astray , and is unfaithful to him ,
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel ; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water .
but if you have gone astray , being under your husband , and if you are defiled , and some man has lain with you besides your husband : "
and this water that brings a curse will go into your bowels , and make your body swell , and your thigh fall away . " the woman shall say , " Amen , Amen . "
" ' the priest shall write these curses in a book , and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness .
he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse ; and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter .
the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the meal offering before Yahweh , and bring it to the altar .
the priest shall take a handful of the meal offering , as its memorial , and burn it on the altar , and afterward shall make the woman drink the water .
if the woman isn 't defiled , but is clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .
" ' this is the law of jealousy , when a wife , being under her husband , goes astray , and is defiled ;
or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man , and he is Jealous of his wife ; then he shall set the woman before Yahweh , and the priest shall execute on her all this law .
all the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine , from the seeds even to the skins .
" ' all the days that he separates himself to Yahweh he shall not go near a dead body .
" ' if any man dies very suddenly beside him , and he defiles the head of his separation ; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing . on the seventh day he shall shave it .
on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest , to the door of the tent of Meeting .
the priest shall offer one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make Atonement for him , because he sinned by reason of the dead , and shall make his head holy that same day .
he shall separate to Yahweh the days of his separation , and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering ; but the former days shall be void , because his separation was defiled .
" ' this is the law of the Nazirite : when the days of his separation are fulfilled , he shall be brought to the door of the tent of Meeting ,
and a basket of unleavened bread , cakes of fine flour mixed with oil , and unleavened wafers anointed with oil , and their meal offering , and their drink offerings .
he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh , with the basket of unleavened bread . the priest shall offer also its meal offering , and its drink offering .
" speak to Aaron and to his sons , saying , ' This is how you shall bless the children of Israel . ' you shall tell them ,
Yahweh make his face to shine on you , and be gracious to you .
it happened on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle , and had anointed it and sanctified it , with all its furniture , and the altar with all its vessels , and had anointed and sanctified them ;
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Moses took the wagons and the oxen , and gave them to the Levites .
he gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon , according to their service :
and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari , according to their service , under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
but to the sons of Kohath he gave none , because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them ; they carried it on their shoulders .
the princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes gave their offerings before the altar .
he who offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab , of the tribe of Judah ,
on the second day Nethanel the son of Zuar , prince of Issachar , gave his offering .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , five male lambs a year old . this was the offering of Nethanel the son of Zuar .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , and five male lambs a year old . this was the offering of Eliab the son of Helon .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , and five male lambs a year old . this was the offering of Elizur the son of Shedeur .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , and five male lambs a year old : this was the offering of Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , and five male lambs a year old . this was the offering of Eliasaph the son of Deuel .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , and five male lambs a year old . this was the offering of Elishama the son of Ammihud .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , and five male lambs a year old . this was the offering of Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , and five male lambs a year old . this was the offering of Abidan the son of Gideoni .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , and five male lambs a year old . this was the offering of Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , and five male lambs a year old . this was the offering of Pagiel the son of Ochran .
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings , two head of cattle , five rams , five male goats , and five male lambs a year old . this was the offering of Ahira the son of Enan .
this was the dedication of the altar , on the day when it was anointed , by the princes of Israel : twelve silver platters , twelve silver bowls , twelve golden ladles ;
each silver platter weighing one hundred thirty shekels , and each bowl seventy ; all the silver of the vessels two thousand four hundred shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ;
the twelve golden ladles , full of incense , weighing ten shekels apiece , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; all the gold of the ladles weighed one hundred twenty shekels ;
" speak to Aaron , and tell him , ' When you light the lamps , the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand . ' "
Aaron did so . he lit its lamps to light the area in front of the lampstand , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
this was the workmanship of the lampstand , beaten work of gold . from its base to its flowers , it was beaten work : according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses , so he made the lampstand .
you shall do this to them , to cleanse them : sprinkle the water of cleansing on them , let them shave their whole bodies with a razor , and let them wash their clothes , and cleanse themselves .
then let them take a young bull , and its meal offering , fine flour mixed with oil ; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering .
you shall present the Levites before the tent of Meeting . you shall assemble the whole Congregation of the children of Israel .
you shall present the Levites before Yahweh . the children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites ,
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering , on the behalf of the children of Israel , that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh .
" the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls , and you shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering to Yahweh , to make Atonement for the Levites .
you shall set the Levites before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh .
thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel , and the Levites shall be mine .
" after that , the Levites shall go in to do the service of the tent of Meeting : and you shall cleanse them , and offer them as a wave offering .
for they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel ; instead of all who open the womb , even the firstborn of all the children of Israel , I have taken them to me .
for all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine , both man and animal . on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , I sanctified them for myself .
I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel .
the Levites purified themselves from sin , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh ; and Aaron made Atonement for them to cleanse them .
" this is that which belongs to the Levites : from twenty @-@ five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the tent of Meeting ;
and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the work , and shall serve no more ,
but shall minister with their brothers in the tent of Meeting , to perform the duty , and shall do no service . you shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
Moses spoke to the children of Israel , that they should keep the Passover .
they kept the Passover in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month , at evening , in the wilderness of Sinai . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did .
there were certain men , who were unclean because of the dead body of a man , so that they could not keep the Passover on that day , and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day .
in the second month , on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it ; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
they shall leave none of it until the morning , nor break a bone of it . according to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it .
whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent , then after that the children of Israel traveled ; and in the place where the cloud remained , there the children of Israel encamped .
at the commandment of Yahweh , the children of Israel traveled , and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped . as long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped .
when the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days , then the children of Israel kept Yahweh 's command , and didn 't travel .
sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle ; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped , and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled .
sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning ; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning , they traveled : or by day and by night , when the cloud was taken up , they traveled .
at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped , and at the commandment of Yahweh they traveled . they kept Yahweh 's command , at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses .
" make two trumpets of silver . you shall make them of beaten work . you shall use them for the calling of the Congregation , and for the journeying of the camps .
if they blow just one , then the princes , the heads of the thousands of Israel , shall gather themselves to you .
when you blow an alarm , the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward .
when you blow an alarm the second time , the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward . they shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
but when the assembly is to be gathered together , you shall blow , but you shall not sound an alarm .
" the sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow the trumpets . this shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations .
the children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran .
first , the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies . Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army .
Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar .
Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun .
the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari , who bore the tabernacle , went forward .
the standard of the camp of Reuben went forward according to their armies . Elizur the son of Shedeur was over his army .
Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad .
the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies . Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army .
Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh .
Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin .
the standard of the camp of the children of Dan , which was the rear guard of all the camps , set forward according to their armies . Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army .
Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher .
Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali .
thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies ; and they went forward .
he said to him , " I will not go ; but I will depart to my own land , and to my relatives . "
it shall be , if you go with us , yes , it shall be , that whatever good Yahweh does to us , we will do the same to you . "
they set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days ' journey . the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh went before them three days ' journey , to seek out a resting place for them .
the cloud of Yahweh was over them by day , when they set forward from the camp .
it happened , when the Ark went forward , that Moses said , " Rise up , Yahweh , and let your enemies be scattered ! let those who hate you flee before you ! "
the people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh . when Yahweh heard it , his anger was kindled ; and Yahweh 's fire burnt among them , and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp .
the people cried to Moses ; and Moses prayed to Yahweh , and the fire abated .
we remember the fish , which we ate in Egypt for nothing ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlic ;
the manna was like coriander seed , and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium .
when the dew fell on the camp in the night , the manna fell on it .
Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families , every man at the door of his tent ; and the anger of Yahweh was kindled greatly ; and Moses was displeased .
Moses said to Yahweh , " Why have you treated with your servant so badly ? why haven 't I found favor in your sight , that you lay the burden of all this people on me ?
where could I get meat to give to all this people ? for they weep to me , saying , ' Give us meat , that we may eat . '
I am not able to bear all this people alone , because it is too heavy for me .
if you treat me this way , please kill me right now , if I have found favor in your sight ; and don 't let me see my wretchedness . "
you will not eat one day , nor two days , nor five days , neither ten days , nor twenty days ,
shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them , to be sufficient for them ? shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to be sufficient for them ? "
Moses went out , and told the people the words of Yahweh ; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people , and set them around the tent .
while the flesh was yet between their teeth , before it was chewed , the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people , and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague .
Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married ; for he had married a Cushite woman .
now the man Moses was very humble , above all the men who were on the surface of the earth .
Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud , and stood at the door of the tent , and called Aaron and Miriam ; and they both came forward .
with him I will speak mouth to mouth , even plainly , and not in riddles ; and he shall see Yahweh 's form . why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant , against Moses ? "
the cloud departed from over the tent ; and behold , Miriam was leprous , as white as snow . Aaron looked at Miriam , and behold , she was leprous .
Aaron said to Moses , " Oh , my lord , please don 't count this sin against us , in which we have done foolishly , and in which we have sinned .
let her not , I pray , be as one dead , of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother 's womb . "
Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days , and the people didn 't travel until Miriam was brought in again .
Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Yahweh : all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel .
these were their names : of the tribe of Reuben , Shammua the son of Zaccur .
of the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat the son of Hori .
of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
of the tribe of Ephraim , Hoshea the son of nun .
of the tribe of Benjamin , Palti the son of Raphu .
of the tribe of Joseph , of the tribe of Manasseh , Gaddi the son of Susi .
of the tribe of Naphtali , Nahbi the son of Vophsi .
of the tribe of Gad , Geuel the son of Machi .
these are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land . Moses called Hoshea the son of nun Joshua .
Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said to them , " Go up this way by the South , and go up into the hill country :
and see the land , what it is ; and the people who dwell therein , whether they are strong or weak , whether they are few or many ;
and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it is good or bad ; and what cities they are that they dwell in , whether in camps , or in strongholds ;
so they went up , and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob , to the entrance of Hamath .
they went up by the South , and came to Hebron ; and Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were there . ( now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
they came to the valley of Eshcol , and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bore it on a staff between two . they also brought some of the pomegranates and figs .
that place was called the valley of Eshcol , because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there .
they told him , and said , " We came to the land where you sent us ; and surely it flows with milk and honey ; and this is its fruit .
however the people who dwell in the land are strong , and the cities are fortified and very large . moreover , we saw the children of Anak there .
Caleb stilled the people before Moses , and said , " Let us go up at once , and possess it ; for we are well able to overcome it . "
but the men who went up with him said , " We aren 't able to go up against the people ; for they are stronger than we . "
there we saw the Nephilim , the sons of Anak , who come of the Nephilim : and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers , and so we were in their sight . "
all the Congregation lifted up their voice , and cried ; and the people wept that night .
all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole Congregation said to them , " Would that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would that we had died in this wilderness !
they said one to another , " Let us make a captain , and let us return into Egypt . "
then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the Congregation of the children of Israel .
Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , who were of those who spied out the land , tore their clothes :
and they spoke to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , saying , " The land , which we passed through to spy it out , is an exceeding good land .
if Yahweh delights in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it to us ; a land which flows with milk and honey .
only don 't rebel against Yahweh , neither fear the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defense is removed from over them , and Yahweh is with us . Don 't fear them . "
but all the Congregation threatened to stone them with stones . the glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel .
now please let the power of the Lord be great , according as you have spoken , saying ,
please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness , and according as you have forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now . "
but in very deed , as I live , and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Yahweh ;
because all those men who have seen my glory , and my signs , which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness , yet have tempted me these ten times , and have not listened to my voice ;
surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers , neither shall any of those who despised me see it :
but my servant Caleb , because he had another spirit with him , and has followed me fully , him will I bring into the land into which he went ; and his seed shall possess it .
now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley : tomorrow turn , and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea . "
tell them , ' As I live , says Yahweh , surely as you have spoken in my ears , so will I do to you :
but your little ones , that you said should be a prey , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which you have rejected .
but as for you , your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness .
your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years , and shall bear your prostitution , until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness .
I , Yahweh , have spoken , surely this will I do to all this evil Congregation , who are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die . "
the men , whom Moses sent to spy out the land , who returned , and made all the Congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up an evil report against the land ,
even those men who brought up an evil report of the land , died by the plague before Yahweh .
but Joshua the son of nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land .
Don 't go up , for Yahweh isn 't among you ; that you not be struck down before your enemies .
for there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you , and you shall fall by the sword : because you are turned back from following Yahweh , therefore Yahweh will not be with you . "
but they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain : nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and Moses , didn 't depart out of the camp .
then the Amalekite came down , and the Canaanite who lived in that mountain , and struck them and beat them down , even to Hormah .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you have come into the land of your habitations , which I give to you ,
then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of oil :
and wine for the drink offering , the fourth part of a hin , you shall prepare with the burnt offering , or for the sacrifice , for each lamb .
" ' or for a ram , you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil :
and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh .
when you prepare a bull for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice , to accomplish a vow , or for peace offerings to Yahweh ;
then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil :
and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine , for an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh .
thus shall it be done for each bull , or for each ram , or for each of the male lambs , or of the young goats .
according to the number that you shall prepare , so you shall do to everyone according to their number .
" ' all who are native @-@ born shall do these things in this way , in offering an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh .
one law and one ordinance shall be for you , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you . ' "
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land where I bring you ,
then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land , you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh .
of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering : as the wave offering of the threshing floor , so you shall heave it .
and all the Congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven , and the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them ; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly .
the priest shall make Atonement for the soul who errs , when he sins unwittingly , before Yahweh , to make Atonement for him ; and he shall be forgiven .
because he has despised the word of Yahweh , and has broken his commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off ; his iniquity shall be on him . ' "
while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day .
those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron , and to all the Congregation .
they put him in custody , because it had not been declared what should be done to him .
all the Congregation brought him outside of the camp , and stoned him to death with stones ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them that they should make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue :
I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am Yahweh your God . "
and put fire in them , and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow : and it shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses , he shall be holy . you have gone too far , you sons of Levi ! "
Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab ; and they said , " We won 't come up :
is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , but you must also make yourself a prince over us ?
Moses was very angry , and said to Yahweh , " Don 't respect their offering : I have not taken one donkey from them , neither have I hurt one of them . "
and each man take his censer , and put incense on them , and each man bring before Yahweh his censer , two hundred fifty censers ; you also , and Aaron , each his censer . "
they each took his censer , and put fire in them , and laid incense thereon , and stood at the door of the tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron .
Korah assembled all the Congregation against them to the door of the tent of Meeting : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the Congregation .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram ; and the elders of Israel followed him .
if these men die the common death of all men , or if they be visited after the visitation of all men ; then Yahweh hasn 't sent me .
it happened , as he made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground split apart that was under them ;
and the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and all the men who appertained to Korah , and all their goods .
so they , and all that appertained to them , went down alive into Sheol : and the earth closed on them , and they perished from among the assembly .
all Israel that were around them fled at their cry ; for they said , " Lest the earth swallow us up ! "
" speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , that he take up the censers out of the burning , and scatter the fire yonder ; for they are holy ,
but on the next day all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , " You have killed Yahweh 's people ! "
it happened , when the Congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tent of Meeting : and behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of Yahweh appeared .
Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of Meeting .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Aaron did as Moses said , and ran into the midst of the assembly ; and behold , the plague has begun among the people : and he put on the incense , and made Atonement for the people .
now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred , besides those who died about the matter of Korah .
" speak to the children of Israel , and take of them rods , one for each fathers ' house , of all their princes according to their fathers ' houses , twelve rods : write every man 's name on his rod .
you shall write Aaron 's name on the rod of Levi ; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers ' houses .
you shall lay them up in the tent of Meeting before the testimony , where I meet with you .
it shall happen , that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , which they murmur against you . "
Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and all their princes gave him rods , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel : and they looked , and took every man his rod .
Moses did so . as Yahweh commanded him , so he did .
the children of Israel spoke to Moses , saying , " behold , we perish ! we are undone ! we are all undone !
they shall keep your commands , and the duty of all the tent : only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar , that they not die , neither they , nor you .
they shall be joined to you , and keep the responsibility of the tent of Meeting , for all the service of the tent : and a stranger shall not come near to you .
" you shall perform the duty of the sanctuary , and the duty of the altar ; that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel .
I , behold , I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are a gift , given to Yahweh , to do the service of the tent of Meeting .
you shall eat of it like the most holy things . every male shall eat of it . it shall be holy to you .
" all the best of the oil , and all the best of the vintage , and of the grain , the first fruits of them which they give to Yahweh , to you have I given them .
the first @-@ ripe fruits of all that is in their land , which they bring to Yahweh , shall be yours ; everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it .
you shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old , according to your estimation , for five shekels of money , after the shekel of the sanctuary ( the same is twenty gerahs ) .
their flesh shall be yours , as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh , it shall be yours .
Yahweh said to Aaron , " You shall have no inheritance in their land , neither shall you have any portion among them . I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel .
henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the tent of Meeting , lest they bear sin , and die .
but the Levites shall do the service of the tent of Meeting , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations ; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
your wave offering shall be reckoned to you , as though it were the grain of the threshing floor , and as the fullness of the winepress .
out of all your gifts you shall offer every wave offering of Yahweh , of all its best , even the holy part of it out of it . '
you shall eat it in every place , you and your households : for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of Meeting .
you shall give her to Eleazar the priest , and he shall bring her forth outside of the camp , and one shall kill her before his face :
and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of Meeting seven times .
one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her Dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the evening .
he who burns her shall wash his clothes in water , and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the evening .
" this is the law when a man dies in a tent : everyone who comes into the tent , and everyone who is in the tent , shall be unclean seven days .
" whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
" for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering ; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel :
it shall be a perpetual statute to them : and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes , and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening .
there was no water for the Congregation : and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron .
the people strove with Moses , and spoke , saying , " We wish that we had died when our brothers died before Yahweh !
why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness , that we should die there , we and our animals ?
Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of Meeting , and fell on their faces : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them .
Moses lifted up his hand , and struck the rock with his rod twice : and water came forth abundantly , and the Congregation drank , and their livestock .
Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom , saying : " thus says your brother Israel : you know all the travail that has happened to us :
how our fathers went down into Egypt , and we lived in Egypt a long time ; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us , and our fathers :
they traveled from Kadesh : and the children of Israel , even the whole Congregation , came to Mount Hor .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor , by the border of the land of Edom , saying ,
" Aaron shall be gathered to his people ; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel , because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah .
take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up to Mount Hor ;
and strip Aaron of his garments , and put them on Eleazar his son : and Aaron shall be taken , and shall die there . "
Moses did as Yahweh commanded : and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the Congregation .
Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , and put them on Eleazar his son ; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain : and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain .
when all the Congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they wept for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the South , heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim ; and he fought against Israel , and took some of them captive .
Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Canaanites ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities : and the name of the place was called Hormah .
they traveled from Oboth , and encamped at Iyeabarim , in the wilderness which is before Moab , toward the sunrise .
from there they traveled , and encamped in the valley of Zered .
the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar , leans on the border of Moab . "
the well , which the princes dug , which the nobles of the people dug , with the scepter , and with their poles . " from the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah ;
and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looks down on the desert .
Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness , and came to Jahaz ; and he fought against Israel .
Israel took all these cities : and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon , and in all its towns .
for a fire has gone out of Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sihon . it has devoured Ar of Moab , The lords of the high places of the Arnon .
Woe to you , Moab ! you are undone , people of Chemosh ! he has given his sons as fugitives , and his daughters into captivity , to Sihon king of the Amorites .
we have shot at them . Heshbon has perished even to Dibon . we have laid waste even to Nophah , Which reaches to Medeba . "
they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
so they struck him , and his sons and all his people , until there was none left him remaining : and they possessed his land .
Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
Moab was very afraid of the people , because they were many : and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
'Behold , the people that has come out of Egypt , it covers the surface of the earth : now , come curse me them ; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them , and shall drive them out . ' "
the princes of Moab rose up , and they went to Balak , and said , " Balaam refuses to come with us . "
they came to Balaam , and said to him , " Thus says Balak the son of Zippor , ' Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me :
for I will promote you to very great honor , and whatever you say to me I will do . please come therefore , and curse this people for me . ' "
Balaam rose up in the morning , and saddled his donkey , and went with the princes of Moab .
then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh , and she thrust herself to the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he struck her again .
the angel of Yahweh went further , and stood in a narrow place , where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh , and she lay down under Balaam : and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he struck the donkey with his staff .
Balaam said to the donkey , " Because you have mocked me , I wish there were a sword in my hand , for now I would have killed you . "
the angel of Yahweh said to Balaam , " Go with the men ; but only the word that I shall speak to you , that you shall speak . " so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
Balak said to Balaam , " Didn 't I earnestly send to you to call you ? why didn 't you come to me ? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor ? "
Balaam said to Balak , " behold , I have come to you : have I now any power at all to speak anything ? the word that God puts in my mouth , that shall I speak . "
Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep , and sent to Balaam , and to the princes who were with him .
Balak did as Balaam had spoken ; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram .
he returned to him , and behold , he was standing by his burnt offering , he , and all the princes of Moab .
for from the top of the rocks I see him . from the hills I see him . behold , it is a people that dwells alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
who can count the dust of Jacob , or number the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous ! let my last end be like his ! "
he took him into the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , and built seven altars , and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar .
he came to him , and behold , he was standing by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . Balak said to him , " What has Yahweh spoken ? "
behold , I have received a command to bless . he has blessed , and I can 't reverse it .
he has not seen iniquity in Jacob . neither has he seen perverseness in Israel . Yahweh his God is with him . the shout of a king is among them .
God brings them out of Egypt . he has as it were the strength of the wild ox .
surely there is no enchantment with Jacob ; Neither is there any divination with Israel . now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What has God done !
behold , the people rises up as a lioness , As a lion he lifts himself up . he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drinks the blood of the slain . "
but Balaam answered Balak , " Didn 't I tell you , saying , ' All that Yahweh speaks , that I must do ? ' "
Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor , that looks down on the desert .
Balak did as Balaam had said , and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar .
when Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel , he didn 't go , as at the other times , to meet with enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes ; and the Spirit of God came on him .
he took up his parable , and said , " Balaam the son of Beor says , the man whose eye was closed says ;
he says , who hears the words of God , who sees the vision of the Almighty , falling down , and having his eyes open :
as valleys they are spread forth , as gardens by the riverside , as aloes which Yahweh has planted , as cedar trees beside the waters .
water shall flow from his buckets . his seed shall be in many waters . his king shall be higher than Agag . his kingdom shall be exalted .
God brings him out of Egypt . he has as it were the strength of the wild ox . he shall eat up the nations his adversaries , shall break their bones in pieces , and Pierce them with his arrows .
he couched , he lay down as a lion , as a lioness ; who shall rouse him up ? everyone who blesses you is blessed . everyone who curses you is Cursed . "
therefore now flee you to your place ! I thought to promote you to great honor ; but , behold , Yahweh has kept you back from honor . "
now , behold , I go to my people : come , I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days . "
he took up his parable , and said , " Balaam the son of Beor says , the man whose eye was closed says ;
he says , who hears the words of God , knows the knowledge of the Most High , and who sees the vision of the Almighty , Falling down , and having his eyes open :
Edom shall be a possession . Seir , his enemies , also shall be a possession , while Israel does valiantly .
he looked at Amalek , and took up his parable , and said , " Amalek was the first of the nations , But his latter end shall come to destruction . "
he looked at the Kenite , and took up his parable , and said , " Your dwelling place is strong . your nest is set in the rock .
but ships shall come from the coast of Kittim . they shall afflict Asshur , and shall afflict Eber . he also shall come to destruction . "
Balaam rose up , and went and returned to his place ; and Balak also went his way .
Israel stayed in Shittim ; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab :
Yahweh said to Moses , " Take all the chiefs of the people , and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun , that the fierce anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel . "
and it shall be to him , and to his seed after him , the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was Jealous for his God , and made Atonement for the children of Israel . ' "
the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was head of the people of a fathers ' house in Midian .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Reuben , the firstborn of Israel ; the sons of Reuben : of Hanoch , the family of the Hanochites ; of Pallu , the family of the Palluites ;
these are the families of the Reubenites ; and those who were numbered of them were forty @-@ three thousand seven hundred thirty .

these are the sons of Gilead : of Iezer , the family of the Iezerites ; of Helek , the family of the Helekites ;
and Shemida , the family of the Shemidaites ; and Hepher , the family of the Hepherites .
Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons , but daughters : and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .

" to these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names .
to the more you shall give the more inheritance , and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance : to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given .
notwithstanding , the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
these are those who were numbered of the Levites after their families : of Gershon , the family of the Gershonites ; of Kohath , the family of the Kohathites ; of Merari , the family of the Merarites .
the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , who was born to Levi in Egypt : and she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
these are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho .
but among these there was not a man of them who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
" our father died in the wilderness , and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah : but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family , because he had no son ? give to us a possession among the brothers of our father . "
" the daughters of Zelophehad speak right : you shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father 's brothers ; and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them .
if he has no daughter , then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers .
if he has no brothers , then you shall give his inheritance to his father 's brothers .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go up into this mountain of Abarim , and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel .
when you have seen it , you also shall be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother was gathered ;
Moses spoke to Yahweh , saying ,
and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the Congregation ; and commission him in their sight .
you shall put of your honor on him , that all the Congregation of the children of Israel may obey .
Moses did as Yahweh commanded him ; and he took Joshua , and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the Congregation :
and he laid his hands on him , and commissioned him , as Yahweh spoke by Moses .
you shall tell them , ' This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to Yahweh : male lambs a year old without blemish , two day by day , for a continual burnt offering .

Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded .
when a man vows a vow to Yahweh , or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond , he shall not break his word ; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth .
" also when a woman vows a vow to Yahweh , and binds herself by a bond , being in her father 's house , in her youth ,
" if she has a husband , while her vows are on her , or the rash utterance of her lips , with which she has bound her soul ,
and her husband hears it , and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it ; then her vows shall stand , and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand .
" but the vow of a widow , or of her who is divorced , everything with which she has bound her soul , shall stand against her .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and didn 't disallow her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand .
but if he shall make them null and void after that he has heard them , then he shall bear her iniquity . "
these are the statutes , which Yahweh commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , between a father and his daughter , being in her youth , in her father 's house .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Moses spoke to the people , saying , " ARM men from among you for the war , that they may go against Midian , to execute Yahweh 's vengeance on Midian .
of every tribe one thousand , throughout all the tribes of Israel , you shall send to the war . "
so there were delivered , out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
Moses sent them , one thousand of every tribe , to the war , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand .
all their cities in the places in which they lived , and all their encampments , they burnt with fire .
they took all the spoil , and all the prey , both of man and of animal .
Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and all the princes of the Congregation , went forth to meet them outside of the camp .
Moses was angry with the officers of the army , the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , who came from the service of the war .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor , and so the plague was among the Congregation of Yahweh .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him .
but all the girls , who have not known man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
" Encamp outside of the camp seven days : whoever has killed any person , and whoever has touched any slain , purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day , you and your captives .
as to every garment , and all that is made of skin , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood , you shall purify yourselves . "
Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle , " This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses :
you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day , and you shall be clean ; and afterward you shall come into the camp . "
" take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of animal , you , and Eleazar the priest , and the heads of the fathers ' households of the Congregation ;
and divide the prey into two parts : between the men skilled in war , who went out to battle , and all the Congregation .
now the prey , over and above the booty which the men of war took , was six hundred seventy @-@ five thousand sheep ,
and thirty @-@ two thousand persons in all , of the women who had not known man by lying with him .
the half , which was the portion of those who went out to war , was in number three hundred thirty @-@ seven thousand five hundred sheep :
the cattle were thirty @-@ six thousand ; of which Yahweh 's tribute was seventy @-@ two .
the donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred ; of which Yahweh 's tribute was sixty @-@ one .
Moses gave the tribute , which was Yahweh 's wave offering , to Eleazar the priest , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
of the children of Israel 's half , which Moses divided off from the men who warred
( now the Congregation 's half was three hundred thirty @-@ seven thousand five hundred sheep ,
the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the captains of thousands , and the captains of hundreds , came near to Moses ;
and they said to Moses , " Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command , and there lacks not one man of us .
all the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels .
( the men of war had taken booty , every man for himself . )
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tent of Meeting , for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh .
they said , " If we have found favor in your sight , let this land be given to your servants for a possession ; don 't bring us over the Jordan . "
Moses said to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , " shall your brothers go to the war , and shall you sit here ?
why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them ?
for when they went up to the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them .
Yahweh 's anger was kindled in that day , and he swore , saying ,
Yahweh 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh , was consumed .
" behold , you have risen up in your fathers ' place , an increase of sinful men , to augment yet the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel .
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
we will not return to our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance .
for we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan , and forward ; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward . "
Moses said to them , " If you will do this thing , if you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war ,
and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh , until he has driven out his enemies from before him ,
and the land is subdued before Yahweh ; then afterward you shall return , and be guiltless towards Yahweh , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh .
" but if you will not do so , behold , you have sinned against Yahweh ; and be sure your sin will find you out .
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses , saying , " Your servants will do as my lord commands .
our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our livestock , shall be there in the cities of Gilead ;
but your servants will pass over , every man who is armed for war , before Yahweh to battle , as my lord says . "
so Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest , and to Joshua the son of nun , and to the heads of the fathers ' households of the tribes of the children of Israel .
but if they will not pass over with you armed , they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan . "
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , " As Yahweh has said to your servants , so will we do .
we will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan , and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan . "
the children of Gad built Dibon , and Ataroth , and Aroer ,
the children of Reuben built Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Kiriathaim ,
the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead , and took it , and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Yahweh : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
they traveled from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the next day after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians ,
while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn , whom Yahweh had struck among them : on their gods also Yahweh executed judgments .
they traveled from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , which is in the edge of the wilderness .
they traveled from Etham , and turned back to Pihahiroth , which is before Baal Zephon : and they encamped before Migdol .
they traveled from before Hahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness : and they went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and encamped in Marah .
they traveled from Marah , and came to Elim : and in Elim were twelve springs of water , and seventy palm trees ; and they encamped there .
they traveled from Elim , and encamped by the Red Sea .
they traveled from the Red Sea , and encamped in the wilderness of sin .
they traveled from the wilderness of sin , and encamped in Dophkah .
they traveled from Alush , and encamped in Rephidim , where there was no water for the people to drink .
they traveled from Rephidim , and encamped in the wilderness of Sinai .
they traveled from Ezion Geber , and encamped in the wilderness of Zin ( the same is Kadesh ) .
they traveled from Kadesh , and encamped in Mount Hor , in the edge of the land of Edom .
Aaron was one hundred twenty @-@ three years old when he died in Mount Hor .
the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the South in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
they traveled from Oboth , and encamped in Iye Abarim , in the border of Moab .
they traveled from the mountains of Abarim , and encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho .
they encamped by the Jordan , from Beth Jeshimoth even to Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab .
speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , " When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , destroy all their stone idols , destroy all their molten images , and demolish all their high places .
you shall take possession of the land , and dwell therein ; for I have given given the land to you to possess it .
it shall happen that as I thought to do to them , so will I do to you . "
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom , and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward ;
and the border shall turn about from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
" ' for the western border , you shall have the great sea and its border : this shall be your west border .
" ' this shall be your north border : from the great sea you shall mark out for you Mount Hor ;
from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad ;
and the border shall go forth to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar Enan : this shall be your north border .
and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall go down , and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward ;
and the border shall go down to the Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea . this shall be your land according to its borders around it . ' "
the two tribes and the half @-@ tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward , toward the sunrise . "
" these are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance : Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of nun .
these are the names of the men : of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
of the tribe of the children of Simeon , Shemuel the son of Ammihud .
of the tribe of Benjamin , Elidad the son of Chislon .
of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince , Bukki the son of Jogli .
of the children of Joseph : of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince , Hanniel the son of Ephod .
of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince , Kemuel the son of Shiphtan .
of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince , Elizaphan the son of Parnach .
of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince , Ahihud the son of Shelomi .
of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince , Pedahel the son of Ammihud . "
these are they whom Yahweh commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan .
" command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites .
the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock , and for their substance , and for all their animals .
" the suburbs of the cities , which you shall give to the Levites , shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it .
" the cities which you shall give to the Levites , they shall be the six cities of refuge , which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to : and besides them you shall give forty @-@ two cities .
all the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty @-@ eight cities together with their suburbs .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you , that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there .
the cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger , that the manslayer not die , until he stands before the Congregation for judgment .
you shall give three cities beyond the Jordan , and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan ; they shall be cities of refuge .
for the children of Israel , and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them , shall these six cities be for refuge ; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there .
" ' but if he struck him with an instrument of iron , so that he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
if he struck him with a stone in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
the avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death : when he meets him , he shall put him to death .
" ' but if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge , where he flees ,
and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge , and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood ,
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession .
" ' these things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
" ' whoever kills any person , the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die .
" ' moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death ; but he shall surely be put to death .
" ' you shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge , that he may come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
and they said , " Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters .
Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Yahweh , saying , " The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right .
this is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them be married to whom they think best ; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married .
so shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe ; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
so shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance . "
the daughters of Zelophehad did as Yahweh commanded Moses :
they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph ; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
these are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho .
after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites , who lived in Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , who lived in Ashtaroth , at Edrei .
I spoke to you at that time , saying , " I am not able to bear you myself alone :
Yahweh your God has multiplied you , and behold , you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude .
Yahweh , the God of your fathers , make you a thousand times as many as you are , and bless you , as he has promised you !
take wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes , and I will make them heads over you . "
I said to you , " You have come to the hill country of the Amorites , which Yahweh our God gives to us .
and they turned and went up into the hill country , and came to the valley of Eshcol , and spied it out .
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us . "
who went before you in the way , to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to show you by what way you should go , and in the cloud by day .
Joshua the son of nun , who stands before you , he shall go in there : encourage you him ; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
but as for you , turn , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea . "
the Amorites , who lived in that hill country , came out against you , and chased you , as bees do , and beat you down in Seir , even to Hormah .
so you stayed in Kadesh many days , according to the days that you remained .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea , as Yahweh spoke to me ; and we encircled Mount Seir many days .
Yahweh spoke to me , saying ,
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yourselves therefore ;
Don 't contend with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on ; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession .
so we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber . we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
( the Emim lived therein before , a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakim :
moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them , to destroy them from the midst of the camp , until they were consumed .
so it happened , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakim ; but Yahweh destroyed them before them ; and they succeeded them , and lived in their place ;
as he did for the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , when he destroyed the Horites from before them ; and they succeeded them , and lived in their place even to this day :
and the Avvim , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Caphtorim , who came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" let me pass through your land : I will go along by the highway , I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left .
then Sihon came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Jahaz .
Yahweh our God delivered him up before us ; and we struck him , and his sons , and all his people .
we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed every inhabited city , with the women and the little ones ; we left none remaining :
only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves , with the spoil of the cities which we had taken .
only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn 't come near ; all the side of the river Jabbok , and the cities of the hill country , and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us .
then we turned , and went up the way to Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
so Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also , the king of Bashan , and all his people : and we struck him until none was left to him remaining .
but all the livestock , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey to ourselves .
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon .
( the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion , and the Amorites call it Senir . )
we took all the cities of the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , to Salecah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
this land we took in possession at that time : from Aroer , which is by the valley of the Arnon , and half the hill country of Gilead , and its cities , gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites :
the Arabah also , and the Jordan and its border , from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah , the Salt Sea , under the slopes of Pisgah eastward .
I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , " Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings : so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over .
you shall not fear them ; for Yahweh your God , he it is who fights for you . "
go up to the top of Pisgah , and lift up your eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and see with your eyes : for you shall not go over this Jordan .
but commission Joshua , and encourage him , and strengthen him ; for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see . "
you shall not add to the word which I command you , neither shall you diminish from it , that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you .
your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor ; for all the men who followed Baal Peor , Yahweh your God has destroyed them from the midst of you .
but you who were faithful to Yahweh your God are all alive this day .
behold , I have taught you statutes and ordinances , even as Yahweh my God commanded me , that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it .
for what great nation is there , that has a god so near to them , as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him ?
what great nation is there , that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law , which I set before you this day ?
you came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky , with darkness , cloud , and thick darkness .
Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire : you heard the voice of words , but you saw no form ; you only heard a voice .
he declared to you his Covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even the ten commandments ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone .
Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances , that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it .
take therefore good heed to yourselves ; for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire .
furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes , and swore that I should not go over the Jordan , and that I should not go in to that good land , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance :
but I must die in this land , I must not go over the Jordan ; but you shall go over , and possess that good land .
take heed to yourselves , lest you forget the Covenant of Yahweh your God , which he made with you , and make you an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you .
Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples , and you shall be left few in number among the nations , where Yahweh shall lead you away .
there you shall serve gods , the work of men 's hands , wood and stone , which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
but from there you shall seek Yahweh your God , and you shall find him , when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul .
when you are in oppression , and all these things have come on you , in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God , and listen to his voice :
for Yahweh your God is a merciful God ; he will not fail you , neither destroy you , nor forget the Covenant of your fathers which he swore to them .
did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as you have heard , and live ?
it was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is God . there is no one else besides him .
to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you , to bring you in , to give you their land for an inheritance , as at this day .
know therefore this day , and lay it to your heart , that Yahweh he is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath ; there is none else .
that the manslayer might flee there , who kills his neighbor unawares , and didn 't hate him in time past ; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live :
Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , for the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , for the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , for the Manassites .
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which Moses spoke to the children of Israel , when they came forth out of Egypt ,
they took his land in possession , and the land of Og king of Bashan , the two kings of the Amorites , who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise ;
from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , even to Mount Sion ( the same is Hermon ) ,
Yahweh didn 't make this Covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire ,
( I stood between Yahweh and you at that time , to show you the word of Yahweh : for you were afraid because of the fire , and didn 't go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
" you shall not make an engraved image for yourself , any likeness of what is in heaven above , or what is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
" you shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain : for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more , then we shall die .
go near , and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say : and tell us all that Yahweh our God shall tell you ; and we will hear it , and do it . "
Oh that there were such a heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children forever !
you shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you : you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
you shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess .
now this is the commandment , the statutes , and the ordinances , which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you , that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it ;
and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your might .
these words , which I command you this day , shall be on your heart ;
and you shall teach them diligently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
you shall bind them for a sign on your hand , and they shall be for symbols between your eyes .
you shall write them on the door posts of your house , and on your gates .
then beware lest you forget Yahweh , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
you shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the peoples who are around you ;
for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a Jealous God ; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you , and he destroy you from off the face of the earth .
you shall not tempt Yahweh your God , as you tempted him in Massah .
you shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he has commanded you .
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers ,
to thrust out all your enemies from before you , as Yahweh has spoken .
when your son asks you in time to come , saying , " What do the testimonies , the statutes , and the ordinances , which Yahweh our God has commanded you mean ? "
then you shall tell your son , " We were Pharaoh 's bondservants in Egypt : and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand ;
and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt , on Pharaoh , and on all his house , before our eyes ;
and he brought us out from there , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he swore to our fathers .
Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes , to fear Yahweh our God , for our good always , that he might preserve us alive , as at this day .
it shall be righteousness to us , if we observe to do all this commandment before Yahweh our God , as he has commanded us . "
neither shall you make marriages with them ; your daughter you shall not give to his son , nor shall you take his daughter for your son .
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so the anger of Yahweh would be kindled against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their altars , and dash their pillars in pieces , and cut down their Asherim , and burn their engraved images with fire .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God : Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
Yahweh didn 't set his love on you , nor choose you , because you were more in number than any people ; for you were the fewest of all peoples :
know therefore that Yahweh your God , he is God , the faithful God , who keeps Covenant and loving kindness with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations ,
and repays those who hate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be Slack to him who hates him , he will repay him to his face .
you shall therefore keep the commandment , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which I command you this day , to do them .
you shall be blessed above all peoples : there shall not be male or female barren among you , or among your livestock .
Yahweh will take away from you all sickness ; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who hate you .
you shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you ; your eye shall not pity them : neither shall you serve their gods ; for that will be a snare to you .
if you shall say in your heart , " These nations are more than I ; how can I dispossess them ? "
you shall not be afraid of them : you shall well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh , and to all Egypt ;
moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them , until those who are left , and hide themselves , perish from before you .
you shall not be scared of them ; for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you , a great and awesome God .
Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little : you may not consume them at once , lest the animals of the field increase on you .
but Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you , and will confuse them with a great confusion , until they be destroyed .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall observe to do all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers .
your clothing didn 't grow old on you , neither did your foot swell , these forty years .
you shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son , so Yahweh your God chastens you .
for Yahweh your God brings you into a good land , a land of brooks of water , of springs , and underground water flowing into valleys and hills ;
a land of wheat and barley , and vines and fig trees and pomegranates ; a land of olive trees and honey ;
a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness , you shall not lack anything in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hills you may dig copper .
you shall eat and be full , and you shall bless Yahweh your God for the good land which he has given you .
beware lest you forget Yahweh your God , in not keeping his commandments , and his ordinances , and his statutes , which I command you this day :
lest , when you have eaten and are full , and have built goodly houses , and lived therein ;
and when your herds and your flocks multiply , and your silver and your gold is multiplied , and all that you have is multiplied ;
then your heart be lifted up , and you forget Yahweh your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage ;
who led you through the great and terrible wilderness , with fiery Serpents and Scorpions , and thirsty ground where there was no water ; who brought you forth water out of the rock of Flint ;
who fed you in the wilderness with manna , which your fathers didn 't know ; that he might humble you , and that he might prove you , to do you good at your latter end :
and lest you say in your heart , " My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth . "
but you shall remember Yahweh your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his Covenant which he swore to your fathers , as at this day .
as the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you , so you shall perish ; because you wouldn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
a people great and tall , the sons of the Anakim , whom you know , and of whom you have heard say , " Who can stand before the sons of Anak ? "
know therefore , that Yahweh your God doesn 't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness ; for you are a stiff @-@ necked people .
also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath , and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you .
it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant .
furthermore Yahweh spoke to me , saying , " I have seen this people , and behold , it is a stiff @-@ necked people :
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from under the sky ; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they . "
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the Covenant were in my two hands .
I looked , and behold , you had sinned against Yahweh your God ; you had made yourselves a molten calf : you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you .
I took hold of the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and broke them before your eyes .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you . but Yahweh listened to me that time also .
so I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down , because Yahweh had said he would destroy you .
remember your servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; don 't look to the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin ,
I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke , and you shall put them in the Ark . "
so I made an Ark of acacia wood , and cut two tables of stone like the first , and went up onto the mountain , having the two tables in my hand .
I turned and came down from the mountain , and put the tables in the Ark which I had made ; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me .
( the children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his place .
from there they traveled to Gudgodah ; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah , a land of brooks of water .
I stayed on the mountain , as at the first time , forty days and forty nights : and Yahweh listened to me that time also ; Yahweh would not destroy you .
Yahweh said to me , " arise , take your journey before the people ; and they shall go in and possess the land , which I swore to their fathers to give to them . "
to keep the commandments of Yahweh , and his statutes , which I command you this day for your good ?
behold , to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens , the earth , with all that is therein .
only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them , and he chose their seed after them , even you above all peoples , as at this day .
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart , and be no more stiff @-@ necked .
for Yahweh your God , he is God of gods , and Lord of lords , the great God , the mighty , and the awesome , who doesn 't respect persons , nor takes reward .
he does execute justice for the fatherless and widow , and loves the foreigner , in giving him food and clothing .
you shall fear Yahweh your God ; you shall serve him ; and you shall cling to him , and you shall swear by his name .
he is your praise , and he is your God , who has done for you these great and awesome things , which your eyes have seen .
therefore you shall love Yahweh your God , and keep his instructions , and his statutes , and his ordinances , and his commandments , always .
know this day : for I don 't speak with your children who have not known , and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his outstretched arm ,
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and to all his land ;
and what he did to you in the wilderness , until you came to this place ;
but your eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which he did .
therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may be strong , and go in and possess the land , where you go over to possess it ;
and that you may prolong your days in the land , which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed , a land flowing with milk and honey .
but the land , where you go over to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water of the rain of the sky ,
a land which Yahweh your God cares for : the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it , from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year .
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day , to love Yahweh your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
that I will give the rain of your land in its season , the former rain and the latter rain , that you may gather in your grain , and your new wine , and your oil .
I will give grass in your fields for your livestock , and you shall eat and be full .
take heed to yourselves , lest your heart be deceived , and you turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ;
therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul ; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand , and they shall be for symbols between your eyes .
you shall teach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
you shall write them on the door posts of your house , and on your gates ;
for if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you , to do it , to love Yahweh your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cling to him ;
every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even to the hinder sea shall be your border .
the blessing , if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , which I command you this day ;
it shall happen , when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it , that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim , and the curse on Mount Ebal .
for you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you , and you shall possess it , and dwell therein .
you shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day .
you shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods , on the high mountains , and on the hills , and under every green tree :
but to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes , to put his name there , even to his habitation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God , and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Yahweh your God has blessed you .
you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatever is right in his own eyes ;
for you haven 't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance , which Yahweh your God gives you .
but when you go over the Jordan , and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit , and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you , so that you dwell in safety ;
take heed to yourself that you don 't offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see ;
but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
only you shall not eat the blood ; you shall pour it out on the earth as water .
take heed to yourself that you don 't forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land .
even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten , so you shall eat of it : the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike .
only be sure that you don 't eat the blood : for the blood is the life ; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh .
you shall not eat it ; you shall pour it out on the earth as water .
only your holy things which you have , and your vows , you shall take , and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose :
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you forever , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
when Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you , where you go in to dispossess them , and you dispossess them , and dwell in their land ;
you shall not do so to Yahweh your God : for every abomination to Yahweh , which he hates , have they done to their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods .
whatever thing I command you , that you shall observe to do : you shall not add thereto , nor diminish from it .
you shall not listen to the words of that prophet , or to that dreamer of dreams : for Yahweh your God proves you , to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
you shall walk after Yahweh your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and you shall serve him , and cling to him .
you shall not consent to him , nor listen to him ; neither shall your eye pity him , neither shall you spare , neither shall you conceal him :
but you shall surely kill him ; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall not do any more such wickedness as this is in the midst of you .
then you shall inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in the midst of you ,
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and its livestock , with the edge of the sword .
you are the children of Yahweh your God : you shall not cut yourselves , nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God , and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
these are the animals which you may eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
the hart , and the gazelle , and the roebuck , and the wild goat , and the ibex , and the antelope , and the chamois .
every animal that parts the hoof , and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud , among the animals , that may you eat .
the pig , because it has a split hoof but doesn 't chew the cud , is unclean to you : of their flesh you shall not eat , and their carcasses you shall not touch .
but these are they of which you shall not eat : the eagle , and the vulture , and the osprey ,
and the red kite , and the falcon , and the kite after its kind ,
and the ostrich , and the owl , and the seagull , and the hawk after its kind ,
the little owl , and the great owl , and the horned owl ,
and the stork , and the heron after its kind , and the hoopoe , and the BAT .
you shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed , that which comes forth from the field year by year .
then you shall turn it into money , and bind up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose :
the Levite who is within your gates , you shall not forsake him ; for he has no portion nor inheritance with you .
at the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year , and shall lay it up within your gates :
this is the way of the release : every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother ; because Yahweh 's release has been proclaimed .
of a foreigner you may exact it : but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release .
if a poor man , one of your brothers , is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives you , you shall not harden your heart , nor shut your hand from your poor brother ;
but you shall surely open your hand to him , and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need , which he lacks .
when you let him go free from you , you shall not let him go empty :
you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock , and out of your threshing floor , and out of your winepress ; as Yahweh your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
you shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt , and Yahweh your God redeemed you : therefore I command you this thing today .
then you shall take an awl , and thrust it through his ear to the door , and he shall be your servant forever . also to your female servant you shall do likewise .
all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify to Yahweh your God : you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd , nor shear the firstborn of your flock .
you shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place which Yahweh shall choose , you and your household .
only you shall not eat its blood ; you shall pour it out on the ground as water .
observe the month of Abib , and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God ; for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night .
you shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which Yahweh shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
you may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates , which Yahweh your God gives you ;
you shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose : and you shall turn in the morning , and go to your tents .
six days you shall eat unleavened bread . on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God ; you shall do no work .
you shall count for yourselves seven weeks : from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yahweh your God blesses you :
you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt : and you shall observe and do these statutes .
you shall keep the feast of tents seven days , after that you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress :
every man shall give as he is able , according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you .
you shall make judges and officers in all your gates , which Yahweh your God gives you , according to your tribes ; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment .
you shall not wrest justice : you shall not respect persons ; neither shall you take a bribe ; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise , and pervert the words of the righteous .
you shall follow that which is altogether just , that you may live , and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
you shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Yahweh your God , which you shall make for yourselves .
you shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox , or a sheep , in which is a blemish , or anything evil ; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
and has gone and served other gods , and worshiped them , or the sun , or the moon , or any of the army of the sky , which I have not commanded ;
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterward the hand of all the people . so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
and you shall come to the priests the Levites , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inquire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you :
the man who does presumptuously , in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the evil from Israel .
you shall surely set him king over yourselves , whom Yahweh your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreigner over you , who is not your brother .
neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart not turn away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
it shall be , when he sits on the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book , out of that which is before the priests the Levites :
the priests the Levites , all the tribe of Levi , shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel : they shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire , and his inheritance .
this shall be the priests ' due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep , that they shall give to the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
for Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes , to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh , him and his sons for ever .
if a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel , where he lives as a foreigner , and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God , as all his brothers the Levites do , who stand there before Yahweh .
when you have come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you , you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations .
there shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , one who uses divination , one who practices sorcery , or an enchanter , or a sorcerer ,
for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh : and because of these abominations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you .
you shall be perfect with Yahweh your God .
for these nations , that you shall dispossess , listen to those who practice sorcery , and to diviners ; but as for you , Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do .
Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you , of your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him .
Yahweh said to me , " They have well said that which they have spoken .
it shall happen , that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
if you say in your heart , " How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken ? "
when Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations , whose land Yahweh your God gives you , and you succeed them , and dwell in their cities , and in their houses ;
you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land , which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
you shall prepare you the way , and divide the borders of your land , which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit , into three parts , that every manslayer may flee there .
this is the case of the manslayer , that shall flee there and live : whoever kills his neighbor unawares , and didn 't hate him in time past ;
therefore I command you , saying , You shall set apart three cities for yourselves .
that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , and so blood be on you .
but if any man hates his neighbor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mortally so that he dies , and he flees into one of these cities ;
then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there , and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
your eye shall not pity him , but you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with you .
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before Yahweh , before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make diligent Inquisition : and , behold , if the witness is a false witness , and has testified falsely against his brother ;
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
those who remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of you .
your eyes shall not pity : life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
it shall be , when you draw near to the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak to the people ,
for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you . "
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people , that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people .
when you draw near to a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace to it .
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you , and shall serve you .
if it will make no peace with you , but will make war against you , then you shall besiege it :
and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand , you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword :
thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but of the cities of these peoples , that Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , you shall save alive nothing that breathes ;
that they not teach you to do after all their abominations , which they have done to their gods ; so would you sin against Yahweh your God .
only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food , you shall destroy and cut them down ; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you , until it fall .
if one be found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it , lying in the field , and it isn 't known who has struck him ;
then your elders and your judges shall come forth , and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain :
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water , which is neither plowed nor sown , and shall break the heifer 's neck there in the valley .
the priests the sons of Levi shall come near ; for them Yahweh your God has chosen to minister to him , and to bless in the name of Yahweh ; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be .
all the elders of that city , who are nearest to the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley ;
forgive , Yahweh , your people Israel , whom you have redeemed , and don 't allow innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel . " the blood shall be forgiven them .
so you shall put away the innocent blood from the midst of you , when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands , and you carry them away captive ,
and see among the captives a beautiful woman , and you have a desire to her , and would take her to you as wife ;
then you shall bring her home to your house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
if a man have two wives , the one beloved , and the other hated , and they have borne him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated ;
then it shall be , in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has , that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated , who is the firstborn :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the elders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the elders of his city , " This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard . "
all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be put to death , and you hang him on a tree ;
you shall not see your brother 's ox or his sheep go astray , and hide yourself from them : you shall surely bring them again to your brother .
you shall not see your brother 's donkey or his ox fallen down by the way , and hide yourself from them : you shall surely help him to lift them up again .
a woman shall not wear men 's clothing , neither shall a man put on women 's clothing ; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
you shall surely let the hen go , but the young you may take to yourself ; that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days .
when you build a new house , then you shall make a battlement for your roof , that you don 't bring blood on your house , if any man fall from there .
you shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed , lest the whole fruit be forfeited , the seed which you have sown , and the increase of the vineyard .
you shall make yourselves fringes on the four borders of your cloak , with which you cover yourself .
then shall the father of the young lady , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady 's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate ;
the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him ;
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the evil from Israel .
if there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
for he found her in the field , the pledged to be married lady cried , and there was none to save her .
if a man find a lady who is a virgin , who is not pledged to be married , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has humbled her ; he may not put her away all his days .
he who is wounded in the stones , or has his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh .
a Bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh ; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Yahweh .
an Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh ; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever :
because they didn 't meet you with bread and with water in the way , when you came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse you .
nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn 't listen to Balaam ; but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you , because Yahweh your God loved you .
you shall not abhor an Edomite ; for he is your brother : you shall not abhor an Egyptian , because you lived as a foreigner in his land .
the children of the third generation who are born to them shall enter into the assembly of Yahweh .
when you go forth in camp against your enemies , then you shall keep yourselves from every evil thing .
if there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night , then shall he go outside of the camp . he shall not come within the camp :
you shall have a place also outside of the camp , where you shall go forth abroad :
and you shall have a paddle among your weapons ; and it shall be , when you sit down abroad , you shall dig therewith , and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you :
you shall not deliver to his master a servant who is escaped from his master to you :
there shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel , neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel .
you shall not bring the hire of a prostitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow : for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
you shall not lend on interest to your brother ; interest of money , interest of food , interest of anything that is lent on interest :
when you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God , you shall not be Slack to pay it : for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
but if you shall forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in you .
when you come into your neighbor 's vineyard , then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure ; but you shall not put any in your vessel .
when she is departed out of his house , she may go and be another man 's wife .
take heed in the plague of leprosy , that you observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them , so you shall observe to do .
remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam , by the way as you came forth out of Egypt .
when you do lend your neighbor any kind of loan , you shall not go into his house to get his pledge .
you shall stand outside , and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you .
you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down , that he may sleep in his garment , and bless you : and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God .
you shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
you shall not deprive the foreigner , or the fatherless of justice , nor take a widow 's clothing in pledge ;
but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt , and Yahweh your God redeemed you there : therefore I command you to do this thing .
when you beat your olive tree , you shall not go over the boughs again : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
when you harvest your vineyard , you shall not glean it after yourselves : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
you shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt : therefore I command you to do this thing .
if there is a controversy between men , and they come to judgment , and the judges judge them ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked ;
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his wickedness , by number .
forty stripes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then your brother should seem vile to you .
it shall be , that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name not be blotted out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak to him : and if he stand , and say , " I don 't want to take her " ;
his name shall be called in Israel , The house of him who has his shoe untied .
then you shall cut off her hand , your eye shall have no pity .
you shall have a perfect and just weight . you shall have a perfect and just measure , that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
for all who do such things , all who do unrighteously , are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
how he met you by the way , and struck the hindmost of you , all who were feeble behind you , when you were faint and weary ; and he didn 't fear God .
it shall be , when you have come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , and possess it , and dwell therein ,
the priest shall take the basket out of your hand , and set it down before the altar of Yahweh your God .
and we cried to Yahweh , the God of our fathers , and Yahweh heard our voice , and saw our affliction , and our toil , and our oppression ;
and Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror , and with signs , and with wonders ;
and he has brought us into this place , and has given us this land , a land flowing with milk and honey .
you shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Levite , and the foreigner who is in the midst of you .
look down from your holy habitation , from heaven , and bless your people Israel , and the ground which you have given us , as you swore to our fathers , a land flowing with milk and honey . "
this day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances : you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart , and with all your soul .
you have declared Yahweh this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his ordinances , and listen to his voice :
and Yahweh has declared you this day to be a people for his own possession , as he has promised you , and that you should keep all his commandments ;
it shall be , when you have passed over the Jordan , that you shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in Mount Ebal , and you shall plaster them with plaster .
there you shall build an altar to Yahweh your God , an altar of stones : you shall lift up no iron on them .
you shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones ; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God :
and you shall sacrifice peace offerings , and shall eat there ; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God .
you shall therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command you this day . "
" these shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people , when you have passed over the Jordan : Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Joseph , and Benjamin .
the Levites shall answer , and tell all the men of Israel with a loud voice ,
'Cursed is he who lies with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
and all these blessings shall come on you , and overtake you , if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
you shall be blessed in the city , and you shall be blessed in the field .
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
you shall be blessed when you come in , and you shall be blessed when you go out .
Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you . they will come out against you one way , and will flee before you seven ways .
Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to himself , as he has sworn to you ; if you shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , and walk in his ways .
all the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of Yahweh ; and they shall be afraid of you .
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
you shall be Cursed in the city , and you shall be Cursed in the field .
the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock shall be Cursed .
you shall be Cursed when you come in , and you shall be Cursed when you go out .
Yahweh will make the pestilence cling to you , until he has consumed you from off the land , where you go in to possess it .
your sky that is over your head shall be brass , and the earth that is under you shall be iron .
Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust : from the sky shall it come down on you , until you are destroyed .
your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky , and to the animals of the earth ; and there shall be none to frighten them away .
Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt , and with the tumors , and with the scurvy , and with the itch , of which you can not be healed .
Yahweh will strike you with madness , and with blindness , and with astonishment of heart ;
and you shall grope at noonday , as the blind gropes in darkness , and you shall not prosper in your ways : and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always , and there shall be none to save you .
you shall betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not dwell therein : you shall plant a vineyard , and shall not use its fruit .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
the fruit of your ground , and all your labors , shall a nation which you don 't know eat up ; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always ;
so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which you shall see .
Yahweh will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
you shall become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all the peoples where Yahweh shall lead you away .
you shall carry much seed out into the field , and shall gather little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
you shall plant vineyards and dress them , but you shall neither drink of the wine , nor harvest ; for the worm shall eat them .
you shall have olive trees throughout all your borders , but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil ; for your olives shall drop off .
you shall father sons and daughters , but they shall not be yours ; for they shall go into captivity .
all your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess .
the foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above you higher and higher ; and you shall come down lower and lower .
he shall lend to you , and you shall not lend to him : he shall be the head , and you shall be the tail .
because you didn 't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , by reason of the abundance of all things ;
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining ;
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this glorious and fearful name , YAHWEH your God ;
then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful , and the plagues of your seed , even great plagues , and of long continuance , and severe sicknesses , and of long continuance .
he will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt , which you were afraid of ; and they shall cling to you .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , Yahweh will bring them on you , until you are destroyed .
you shall be left few in number , whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude ; because you didn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and pining of soul ;
and your life shall hang in doubt before you ; and you shall fear night and day , and shall have no assurance of your life .
these are the words of the Covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , besides the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
but Yahweh has not given you a heart to know , and eyes to see , and ears to hear , to this day .
I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes have not grown old on you , and your shoes have not grown old on your feet .
when you came to this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , came out against us to battle , and we struck them :
and we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half @-@ tribe of the Manassites .
keep therefore the words of this Covenant , and do them , that you may prosper in all that you do .
that you may enter into the Covenant of Yahweh your God , and into his oath , which Yahweh your God makes with you this day ;
neither with you only do I make this Covenant and this oath ,
( for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt , and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed ;
and you have seen their abominations , and their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them ) ;
Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the Covenant that is written in this book of the law .
then men shall say , " Because they forsook the Covenant of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
and went and served other gods , and worshiped them , gods that they didn 't know , and that he had not given to them :
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land , to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book ;
and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as at this day . "
the secret things belong to Yahweh our God ; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever , that we may do all the words of this law .
and shall return to Yahweh your God , and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your soul ;
that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity , and have compassion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yahweh your God has scattered you .
if your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens , from there will Yahweh your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :
and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it ; and he will do you good , and multiply you above your fathers .
Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart , and the heart of your seed , to love Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , that you may live .
Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies , and on those who hate you , who persecuted you .
you shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh , and do all his commandments which I command you this day .
for this commandment which I command you this day , it is not too hard for you , neither is it far off .
but the word is very near to you , in your mouth , and in your heart , that you may do it .
behold , I have set before you this day life and good , and death and evil ;
but if your heart turns away , and you will not hear , but shall be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
I denounce to you this day , that you shall surely perish ; you shall not prolong your days in the land , where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it .
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yahweh has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Yahweh your God , he will go over before you ; he will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dispossess them . Joshua shall go over before you , as Yahweh has spoken .
Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og , the kings of the Amorites , and to their land ; whom he destroyed .
Yahweh will deliver them up before you , and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you .
be strong and courageous , don 't be afraid , nor be scared of them : for Yahweh your God , he it is who does go with you ; he will not fail you , nor forsake you . "
Yahweh , he it is who does go before you ; he will be with you , he will not fail you , neither forsake you : Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed . "
Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi , who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and to all the elders of Israel .
Moses commanded them , saying , " At the end of every seven years , in the set time of the year of release , in the feast of tents ,
when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose , you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
and that their children , who have not known , may hear , and learn to fear Yahweh your God , as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it . "
Yahweh appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud : and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the tent .
I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked , in that they are turned to other gods .
" now therefore write this song for yourselves , and teach it to the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
so Moses wrote this song the same day , and taught it the children of Israel .
he commissioned Joshua the son of nun , and said , " Be strong and courageous ; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them : and I will be with you . "
it happened , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
that Moses commanded the Levites , who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , saying ,
assemble to me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to witness against them .
Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song , until they were finished .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain . my speech shall condense as the dew , as the small rain on the tender grass , as the showers on the herb .
for I will proclaim the name of Yahweh . Ascribe greatness to our God !
the Rock , his work is perfect , for all his ways are justice : a God of faithfulness and without iniquity , just and right is he .
they have dealt corruptly with him . they are not his children , because of their defect . they are a perverse and crooked generation .
remember the days of old . consider the years of many generations . ask your father , and he will show you ; your elders , and they will tell you .
when the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the children of men , he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel .
for Yahweh 's portion is his people . Jacob is the lot of his inheritance .
he found him in a desert land , in the waste howling wilderness . he surrounded him . he cared for him . he kept him as the apple of his eye .
as an eagle that stirs up her nest , that flutters over her young , he spread abroad his wings , he took them , he bore them on his feathers .
he made him ride on the high places of the earth . he ate the increase of the field . he caused him to suck honey out of the rock , oil out of the flinty rock ;
but Jeshurun grew fat , and kicked . you have grown fat . you have grown thick . you have become sleek . then he forsook God who made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
they moved him to jealousy with strange gods . they provoked him to anger with abominations .
they sacrificed to demons , not God , to gods that they didn 't know , to new gods that came up recently , which your fathers didn 't dread .
of the Rock who became your father , you are unmindful , and have forgotten God who gave you birth .
he said , " I will hide my face from them . I will see what their end shall be ; for they are a very perverse generation , children in whom is no faithfulness .
for a fire is kindled in my anger , Burns to the lowest Sheol , devours the earth with its increase , and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire .
they shall be wasted with hunger , and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction . I will send the teeth of animals on them , With the poison of crawling things of the dust .
outside the sword shall bereave , and in the rooms , terror ; on both young man and virgin , The nursing infant with the gray @-@ haired man .
I said , I would scatter them afar . I would make their memory to cease from among men ;
were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy , lest their adversaries should judge wrongly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is exalted , Yahweh has not done all this . ' "
Oh that they were wise , that they understood this , that they would consider their latter end !
for their vine is of the vine of Sodom , of the fields of Gomorrah . their grapes are grapes of gall , Their clusters are bitter .
vengeance is mine , and recompense , at the time when their foot slides ; for the day of their calamity is at hand . the things that are to come on them shall make haste . "
he will say , " Where are their gods , The rock in which they took refuge ;
which ate the fat of their sacrifices , And drank the wine of their drink offering ? let them rise up and help you ! let them be your protection .
if I whet my glittering sword , My hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to my adversaries , and will recompense those who hate me .
I will make my arrows drunk with blood . my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives , from the head of the leaders of the enemy . "
rejoice , you nations , with his people , for he will avenge the blood of his servants . he will render vengeance to his adversaries , And will make expiation for his land , for his people .
Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he and Joshua the son of nun .
for it is no vain thing for you ; because it is your life , and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land , where you go over the Jordan to possess it . "
and die on the mountain where you go up , and be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor , and was gathered to his people :
because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because you didn 't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel .
for you shall see the land before you ; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel . "
this is the blessing , with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death .
yes , he loves the people . all his saints are in your hand . they sat down at your feet ; each receives your words .
they shall teach Jacob your ordinances , and Israel your law . they shall put incense before you , and whole burnt offering on your altar .
of Joseph he said , " His land is blessed by Yahweh , for the precious things of the heavens , for the dew , for the deep that couches beneath ,
for the precious things of the fruits of the sun , for the precious things of the growth of the moons ,
for the chief things of the ancient mountains , for the precious things of the everlasting hills ,
they shall call the peoples to the mountain . there they will offer sacrifices of righteousness , for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas , the hidden treasures of the sand . "
of Gad he said , " He who enlarges Gad is blessed . he dwells as a lioness , and tears the arm , yes , the crown of the head .
Israel dwells in safety ; the fountain of Jacob alone , In a land of grain and new wine . yes , his heavens drop down dew .
Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho . Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead , to Dan ,
and the South , and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees , to Zoar .
so Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of Yahweh .
he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor : but no man knows of his tomb to this day .
Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died : his eye was not dim , nor his natural force abated .
the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days : so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended .
and in all the mighty hand , and in all the great terror , which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel .
now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh , that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of nun , Moses ' servant , saying ,
" Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , you , and all this people , to the land which I give to them , even to the children of Israel .
I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on , as I told Moses .
from the wilderness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Moses , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor forsake you .
" be strong and courageous ; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them .
haven 't I commanded you ? be strong and courageous . Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed : for Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go . "
Joshua spoke to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , saying ,
" remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you , saying , ' Yahweh your God gives you rest , and will give you this land .
just as we listened to Moses in all things , so will we listen to you . only may Yahweh your God be with you , as he was with Moses .
the king of Jericho sent to Rahab , saying , " Bring out the men who have come to you , who have entered into your house ; for they have come to spy out all the land . "
the woman took the two men and hid them . then she said , " Yes , the men came to me , but I didn 't know where they came from .
it happened about the time of the shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don 't know . pursue them quickly ; for you will overtake them . "
but she had brought them up to the roof , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order on the roof .
the men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords : and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out , they shut the gate .
before they had laid down , she came up to them on the roof ;
as soon as we had heard it , our hearts melted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yahweh your God , he is God in heaven above , and on earth beneath .
then she let them down by a cord through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
she said to them , " Go to the mountain , lest the pursuers find you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers have returned . afterward , you may go your way . "
the men said to her , " We will be guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to swear .
but if you talk about this business of ours , then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear . "
she said , " According to your words , so be it . " she sent them away , and they departed . she tied the scarlet line in the window .
they went , and came to the mountain , and stayed there three days , until the pursuers had returned . the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but didn 't find them .
then the two men returned , descended from the mountain , passed over , and came to Joshua the son of nun ; and they told him all that had happened to them .
Joshua rose up early in the morning ; and they moved from Shittim , and came to the Jordan , he and all the children of Israel . they lodged there before they passed over .
it happened after three days , that the officers went through the midst of the camp ;
behold , the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan .
it happened , when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan , the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant being before the people ,
it happened , when all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan , that Yahweh spoke to Joshua , saying ,
then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
that this may be a sign among you , that when your children ask in time to come , saying , ' What do you mean by these stones ? '
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
it happened , when all the people had completely passed over , that the Ark of Yahweh passed over , with the priests , in the presence of the people .
the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spoke to them .
about forty thousand men , ready and armed for war passed over before Yahweh to battle , to the plains of Jericho .
on that day , Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
Yahweh spoke to Joshua , saying ,
the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , on the east border of Jericho .
Joshua set up those twelve stones , which they took out of the Jordan , in Gilgal .
he spoke to the children of Israel , saying , " When your children ask their fathers in time to come , saying , ' What do these stones mean ? '
then you shall let your children know , saying , ' Israel came over this Jordan on dry land .
Joshua made himself Flint knives , and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins .
this is the reason Joshua circumcised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
for all the people who came out were circumcised ; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised .
their children , whom he raised up in their place , were circumcised by Joshua ; for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them on the way .
it happened , when they were done circumcising all the nation , that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed .
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you . " therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal , to this day .
the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal . they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho .
they ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover , in the same day .
the prince of Yahweh 's army said to Joshua , " Take your shoes off of your feet ; for the place on which you stand is holy . " Joshua did so .
now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel . no one went out , and no one came in .
all your men of war shall march around the city , going around the city once . you shall do this six days .
seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the Ark . on the seventh day , you shall march around the city seven times , and the priests shall blow the trumpets .
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns before Yahweh advanced , and blew the trumpets ; and the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh followed them .
the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets , and the Ark went after them . the trumpets sounded as they went .
so he caused the Ark of Yahweh to go around the city , going about it once . then they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
it happened at the seventh time , when the priests blew the trumpets , Joshua said to the people , " shout , for Yahweh has given you the city !
but as for you , only keep yourselves from the devoted thing , lest when you have devoted it , you take of the devoted thing ; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are holy to Yahweh . they shall come into Yahweh 's treasury . "
they utterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , both young and old , and ox , and sheep , and donkey , with the edge of the sword .
they burnt the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh 's house .
so about three thousand men of the people went up there , and they fled before the men of AI .
the men of AI struck about thirty @-@ six men of them , and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim , and struck them at the descent . the hearts of the people melted , and became like water .
Oh , Lord , what shall I say , after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies !
so Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes . the tribe of Judah was selected .
he brought near the family of Judah ; and he selected the family of the Zerahites . he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man , and Zabdi was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was selected .
so Joshua sent messengers , and they ran to the tent . behold , it was hidden in his tent , with the silver under it .
they took them from the middle of the tent , and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel . they laid them down before Yahweh .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up to AI . Joshua chose thirty thousand men , the mighty men of valor , and sent them out by night .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
and you shall rise up from the ambush , and take possession of the city ; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand .
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yahweh . behold , I have commanded you . "
Joshua sent them out ; and they went to set up the ambush , and stayed between Bethel and AI , on the west side of AI ; but Joshua stayed among the people that night .
Joshua rose up early in the morning , mustered the people , and went up , he and the elders of Israel , before the people to AI .
he took about five thousand men , and set them in ambush between Bethel and AI , on the west side of the city .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their ambush on the west of the city ; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them . they pursued Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
there was not a man left in AI or Beth El who didn 't go out after Israel . they left the city open , and pursued Israel .
the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hurried and set the city on fire .
when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and killed the men of AI .
for Joshua didn 't draw back his hand , with which he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of AI .
only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves , according to the word of Yahweh which he commanded Joshua .
he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
afterward he read all the words of the law , the blessing and the curse , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
but when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to AI ,
they also resorted to a ruse , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks on their donkeys , and wineskins , old and torn and bound up ,
they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal , and said to him , and to the men of Israel , " We have come from a far country . now therefore make a Covenant with us . "
they said to him , " Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God ; for we have heard of his fame , all that he did in Egypt ,
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan , who was at Ashtaroth .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and has become moldy .
these wineskins , which we filled , were new ; and behold , they are torn . these our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey . "
the men sampled their provisions , and didn 't ask counsel from the mouth of Yahweh .
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a Covenant with them , that they heard that they were their neighbors , and that they lived among them .
the children of Israel traveled and came to their cities on the third day . now their cities were Gibeon , Chephirah , Beeroth , and Kiriath Jearim .
the children of Israel didn 't strike them , because the princes of the Congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh , the God of Israel . all the Congregation murmured against the princes .
but all the princes said to all the Congregation , " We have sworn to them by Yahweh , the God of Israel : now therefore we may not touch them .
this we will do to them , and let them live ; lest wrath be on us , because of the oath which we swore to them . "
Joshua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying , " Why have you deceived us , saying , ' We are very far from you , ' when you live among us ?
now therefore you are Cursed , and some of you will never fail to be bondservants , both wood cutters and Drawers of water for the house of my God . "
now , behold , we are in your hand . do to us as it seems good and right to you to do . "
he did so to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , so that they didn 't kill them .
" come up to me , and help me , and let us strike Gibeon ; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel . "
so Joshua went up from Gilgal , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valor .
Yahweh confused them before Israel , and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon , and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah .
but don 't stay . pursue your enemies , and them from the rear . Don 't allow them to enter into their cities ; for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand . "
it happened , when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed , and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities ,
then Joshua said , " Open the mouth of the cave , and bring those five kings out of the cave to me . "
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
afterward Joshua struck them , put them to death , and hanged them on five trees . they were hanging on the trees until the evening .
Joshua passed from Makkedah , and all Israel with him , to Libnah , and fought against Libnah .
Joshua passed from Libnah , and all Israel with him , to Lachish , and encamped against it , and fought against it .
Joshua passed from Lachish , and all Israel with him , to Eglon ; and they encamped against it fought against it .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword . he utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
Joshua went up from Eglon , and all Israel with him , to Hebron ; and they fought against it .
it happened , when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , to the king of Shimron , to the king of Achshaph ,
and to the kings who were on the north , in the hill country , in the Arabah south of Chinneroth , in the lowland , and in the heights of Dor on the west ,
to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the hill country , and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah .
they went out , they and all their armies with them , many people , even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude , with very many horses and chariots .
all these kings met together ; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom , to fight with Israel .
so Joshua came , and all the people of war with him , against them by the waters of Merom suddenly , and fell on them .
Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel , and they struck them , and chased them to great Sidon , and to Misrephoth Maim , and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward . they struck them until they left them none remaining .
Joshua turned back at that time , and took Hazor , and struck its king with the sword : for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms .
they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them . there was no one left who breathed . he burnt Hazor with fire .
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded .
but as for the cities that stood on their mounds , Israel burned none of them , except Hazor only . Joshua burned that .
as Yahweh commanded Moses his servant , so Moses commanded Joshua . Joshua did so . he left nothing undone of all that Yahweh commanded Moses .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , except the Hivites , the inhabitants of Gibeon . they took all in battle .
for it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts , to come against Israel in battle , that he might utterly destroy them , that they might have no favor , but that he might destroy them , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
there were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel . only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , did some remain .
and the border of Og king of Bashan , of the remnant of the Rephaim , who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them . Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh .
the king of Jericho , one ; the king of AI , which is beside Bethel , one ;
the king of Jarmuth , one ; the king of Lachish , one ;
the king of Eglon , one ; the king of Gezer , one ;
the king of Debir , one ; the king of Geder , one ;
the king of Hormah , one ; the king of Arad , one ;
the king of Libnah , one ; the king of Adullam , one ;
the king of Makkedah , one ; the king of Bethel , one ;
the king of Tappuah , one ; the king of Hepher , one ;
the king of Madon , one ; the king of Hazor , one ;
the king of Shimron Meron , one ; the king of Achshaph , one ;
the king of Taanach , one ; the king of Megiddo , one ;
the king of Kedesh , one ; the king of Jokneam in Carmel , one ;
the king of Dor in the height of Dor , one ; the king of Goiim in Gilgal , one ;
" this is the land that still remains : all the regions of the Philistines , and all the Geshurites ;
on the south ; all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians , to Aphek , to the border of the Amorites ;
and the land of the Gebalites , and all Lebanon , toward the sunrise , from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath ;
with him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond the Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them :
from Aroer , that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the middle of the valley , and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon ;
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , to the border of the children of Ammon ;
and Gilead , and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites , and all Mount Hermon , and all Bashan to Salecah ;
nevertheless the children of Israel didn 't drive out the Geshurites , nor the Maacathites : but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day .
only he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi . the offerings of Yahweh , the God of Israel , made by fire are his inheritance , as he spoke to him .
their border was from Aroer , that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the middle of the valley , and all the plain by Medeba ;
the children of Israel alse killed Balaam also the son of Beor , the soothsayer , with the sword , among the rest of their slain .
the border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan . this was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families , the cities and its villages .
Moses gave to the tribe of Gad , to the children of Gad , according to their families .
their border was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , to Aroer that is before Rabbah ;
and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh , and Betonim ; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir ;
this is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families , the cities and its villages .
Moses gave an inheritance to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh . it was for the half @-@ tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families .
their border was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , sixty cities .
these are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab , beyond the Jordan at Jericho , eastward .
but to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance . Yahweh , the God of Israel , is their inheritance , as he spoke to them .
by the lot of their inheritance , as Yahweh commanded by Moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half @-@ tribe .
for Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half @-@ tribe beyond the Jordan ; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them .
I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land . I brought him word again as it was in my heart .
therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day ; because he wholly followed Yahweh , the God of Israel .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom , even to the wilderness of Zin southward , at the uttermost part of the south .
their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea , from the bay that looks southward ;
and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea , and passed along by Hezron , went up to Addar , and turned about to Karka ;
and it passed along to Azmon , went out at the Brook of Egypt ; and the border ended at the sea . this shall be your south border .
the east border was the Salt Sea , even to the end of the Jordan . the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan .
the border went up to Beth Hoglah , and passed along by the north of Beth Arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron ; and the border extended to Baalah ( the same is Kiriath Jearim ) ;
and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir , and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north ( the same is Chesalon ) , and went down to Beth Shemesh , and passed along by Timnah ;
and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward ; and the border extended to Shikkeron , and passed along to Mount Baalah , and went out at Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
the west border was to the shore of the great sea . this is the border of the children of Judah according to their families .
to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah , according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua , even Kiriath Arba , named after the father of Anak ( the same is Hebron ) .
he went up against the inhabitants of Debir : now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families .
the farthest cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel , Eder , Jagur ,
Lebaoth , Shilhim , Ain , and Rimmon . all the cities are twenty @-@ nine , with their villages .
from Ekron even to the sea , all that were by the side of Ashdod , with their villages .
Ashdod , its towns and its villages ; Gaza , its towns and its villages ; to the Brook of Egypt , and the great sea with its coastline .
Humtah , Kiriath Arba ( the same is Hebron ) , and Zior ; nine cities with their villages .
as for the Jebusites , the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah couldn 't drive them out ; but the Jebusites live with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day .
it went out from Bethel to Luz , and passed along to the border of the Archites to Ataroth ;
and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites , to the border of Beth Horon the lower , even to Gezer ; and ended at the sea .
this was the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families . the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth Addar , to Beth Horon the upper .
the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north . the border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh , and passed along it on the east of Janoah .
it went down from Janoah to Ataroth , to Naarah , reached to Jericho , and went out at the Jordan .
from Tappuah the border went along westward to the Brook of Kanah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families ;
together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
they didn 't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer ; but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day , and have become servants to do forced labor .
because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons . the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh .
the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath , which is before Shechem . the border went along to the right hand , to the inhabitants of En Tappuah .
the land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh ; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim .
southward it was Ephraim 's , and northward it was Manasseh 's , and the sea was his border . they reached to Asher on the north , and to Issachar on the east .
yet the children of Manasseh couldn 't drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and didn 't utterly drive them out .
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh , and set up the tent of Meeting there . the land was subdued before them .
appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe . I will send them , and they shall arise , walk through the land , and describe it according to their inheritance ; and they shall come to me .
they shall divide it into seven portions . Judah shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
you shall survey the land into seven parts , and bring the description here to me ; and I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God .
the men went and passed through the land , and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book . they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh .
Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh . there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions .
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
the south quarter was from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim . the border went out westward , and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah .
it extended northward , went out at En Shemesh , and went out to Geliloth , which is over against the ascent of Adummim . it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben .
it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward , and went down to the Arabah .
the Jordan was its border on the east quarter . this was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin , by the borders around it , according to their families .
now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho , Beth Hoglah , Emek Keziz ,
Zelah , Eleph , the Jebusite ( the same is Jerusalem ) , Gibeath , and Kiriath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and all the villages that were around these cities to Baalath Beer , Ramah of the South . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families .
the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families . the border of their inheritance was to Sarid .
their border went up westward , even to Maralah , and reached to Dabbesheth . it reached to the Brook that is before Jokneam .
it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to the border of Chisloth Tabor . it went out to Daberath , and went up to Japhia .
the border turned around it on the north to Hannathon ; and it ended at the valley of Iphtah El ;
this is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the fourth lot came out for Issachar , even for the children of Issachar according to their families .
the border reached to Tabor , Shahazumah , and Beth Shemesh . their border ended at the Jordan : sixteen cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families , the cities with their villages .
the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families .
it turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon , and reached to Zebulun , and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth Emek and Neiel . it went out to Cabul on the left hand ,
the border turned to Ramah , to the fortified city of Tyre ; and the border turned to Hosah . it ended at the sea by the region of Achzib ;
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali , even for the children of Naphtali according to their families .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families , the cities with their villages .
the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
so they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by its borders . the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of nun in their midst .
according to the commandment of Yahweh , they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim ; and he built the city , and lived there .
Yahweh spoke to Joshua , saying ,
if the avenger of blood pursue after him , then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand ; because he struck his neighbor unintentionally , and didn 't hate him before .
they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali , Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and Kiriath Arba ( the same is Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah .
the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance , according to the commandment of Yahweh , these cities with their suburbs .
the children of Merari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Reuben , out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun .
the children of Israel gave these cities with their suburbs by lot to the Levites , as Yahweh commanded by Moses .
they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are mentioned by name :
and they were for the children of Aaron , of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi ; for theirs was the first lot .
but they gave the fields of the city and its villages to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession .
to the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , Libnah with its suburbs ,
Jattir with its suburbs , Eshtemoa with its suburbs ,
Ain with its suburbs , Juttah with its suburbs , and Beth Shemesh with its suburbs ; nine cities out of those two tribes .
out of the tribe of Benjamin , Gibeon with its suburbs , Geba with its suburbs ,
the families of the children of Kohath , the Levites , even the rest of the children of Kohath , had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim .
they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill country of Ephraim , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and Gezer with its suburbs ,
out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , Taanach with its suburbs , and Gath Rimmon with its suburbs ; two cities .
all the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs .
out of the tribe of Naphtali , Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , Hammothdor with its suburbs , and Kartan with its suburbs ; three cities .
to the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with its suburbs , Kartah with its suburbs ,
all these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families , even the rest of the families of the Levites . their lot was twelve cities .
all the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty @-@ eight cities with their suburbs .
each of these cities included their suburbs around them . it was this way with all these cities .
so Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers . they possessed it , and lived in it .
Yahweh gave them rest all around , according to all that he swore to their fathers . not a man of all their enemies stood before them . Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand .
nothing failed of any good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel . all came to pass .
and said to them , " You have kept all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you , and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you .
you have not left your brothers these many days to this day , but have performed the duty of the commandment of Yahweh your God .
so Joshua blessed them , and sent them away ; and they went to their tents .
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up against them to war .
the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
and with him ten princes , one prince of a fathers ' house for each of the tribes of Israel ; and they were everyone of them head of their fathers ' houses among the thousands of Israel .
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day , although there came a plague on the Congregation of Yahweh ,
that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh ? it will be , since you rebel today against Yahweh , that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole Congregation of Israel .
Didn 't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing , and wrath fell on all the Congregation of Israel ? that man didn 't perish alone in his iniquity . ' "
then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh answered , and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
" therefore we said , ' Let 's now prepare to build ourselves an altar , not for burnt offering , nor for sacrifice ;
it happened after many days , when Yahweh had given rest to Israel from their enemies all around , and Joshua was old and well advanced in years ,
you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations because of you ; for it is Yahweh your God who has fought for you .
Yahweh your God will thrust them out from before you , and drive them from out of your sight . you shall possess their land , as Yahweh your God spoke to you .
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
" for Yahweh has driven great and strong nations out from before you . but as for you , no man has stood before you to this day .
one man of you shall chase a thousand ; for it is Yahweh your God who fights for you , as he spoke to you .
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , for their heads , for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
I took your father Abraham from beyond the River , and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gave him Isaac .
I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau : and I gave to Esau Mount Seir , to possess it . Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
" ' I sent Moses and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did in its midst : and afterward I brought you out .
I brought your fathers out of Egypt : and you came to the sea . the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea .
then Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , arose and fought against Israel . he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you ;
I sent the hornet before you , which drove them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; not with your sword , nor with your bow .
Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples , even the Amorites who lived in the land . therefore we also will serve Yahweh ; for he is our God . "
Joshua said to the people , " You can 't serve Yahweh ; for he is a holy God . he is a Jealous God . he will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins .
the people said to Joshua , " We will serve Yahweh our God , and we will listen to his voice . "
so Joshua made a Covenant with the people that day , and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem .
Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God ; and he took a great stone , and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh .
it happened after these things , that Joshua the son of nun , the servant of Yahweh , died , being one hundred and ten years old .
they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah , which is in the hill country of Ephraim , on the north of the mountain of Gaash .
Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , and had known all the work of Yahweh , that he had worked for Israel .
Eleazar the son of Aaron died . they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son , which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim .
it happened after the death of Joshua , the children of Israel asked of Yahweh , saying , " Who should go up for us first against the Canaanites , to fight against them ? "
Judah went up ; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand : and they struck of them in Bezek ten thousand men .
they found Adoni @-@ Bezek in Bezek ; and they fought against him , and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
but Adoni @-@ Bezek fled ; and they pursued after him , and caught him , and cut off his thumbs and his great toes .
the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem , and took it , and struck it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country , and in the South , and in the lowland .
from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir . ( now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher . )
she said to him , " Give me a blessing ; for that you have set me in the land of the South , give me also springs of water . " then Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
Judah went with Simeon his brother , and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath , and utterly destroyed it . the name of the city was called Hormah .
also Judah took Gaza with its border , and Ashkelon with its border , and Ekron with its border .
Yahweh was with Judah ; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
they gave Hebron to Caleb , as Moses had spoken : and he drove out there the three sons of Anak .
the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem ; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day .
the house of Joseph , they also went up against Bethel ; and Yahweh was with them .
he showed them the entrance into the city ; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let the man go and all his family .
the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called its name Luz , which is its name to this day .
it happened , when Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and did not utterly drive them out .
Ephraim didn 't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer ; but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them .
Zebulun didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites lived among them , and became subject to forced labor .
Asher didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Acco , nor the inhabitants of Sidon , nor of Ahlab , nor of Achzib , nor of Helbah , nor of Aphik , nor of Rehob ;
but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country ; for they would not allow them to come down to the valley ;
but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres , in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became subject to forced labor .
and you shall make no Covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; you shall break down their altars . ' but you have not listened to my voice : why have you done this ?
therefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare to you . "
it happened , when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
now when Joshua had sent the people away , the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land .
the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel .
Joshua the son of nun , the servant of Yahweh , died , being one hundred ten years old .
they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres , in the hill country of Ephraim , on the north of the mountain of Gaash .
also all that generation were gathered to their fathers : and there arose another generation after them , who didn 't know Yahweh , nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and served the Baals ;
wherever they went out , the hand of Yahweh was against them for evil , as Yahweh had spoken , and as Yahweh had sworn to them : and they were very distressed .
Yahweh raised up judges , who saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel ; and he said , " Because this nation have transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers , and have not listened to my voice ;
I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died ;
that by them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk therein , as their fathers kept it , or not . "
they were left to test Israel by them , to know whether they would listen to the commandments of Yahweh , which he commanded their fathers by Moses .
the children of Israel lived among the Canaanites , the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites :
and they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and forgot Yahweh their God , and served the Baals and the Asheroth .
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia : and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years .
when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised up a Savior to the children of Israel , who saved them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek ; and he went and struck Israel , and they possessed the city of palm trees .
Ehud made him a sword which had two edges , a cubit in length ; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh .
when he had made an end of offering the tribute , he sent away the people who bore the tribute .
Ehud came to him ; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room . Ehud said , " I have a message from God to you . " he arose out of his seat .
Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the sword from his right thigh , and thrust it into his body :
and the handle also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed on the blade , for he didn 't draw the sword out of his body ; and it came out behind .
then Ehud went forth into the porch , and shut the doors of the upper room on him , and locked them .
they waited until they were ashamed ; and behold , he didn 't open the doors of the upper room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
Ehud escaped while they waited , and passed beyond the quarries , and escaped to Seirah .
it happened , when he had come , that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim ; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he before them .
they struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , every lusty man , and every man of valor ; and there escaped not a man .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , when Ehud was dead .
Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan , who reigned in Hazor ; the captain of whose army was Sisera , who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles .
the children of Israel cried to Yahweh : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron ; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel .
now Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lappidoth , she judged Israel at that time .
she lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
I will draw to you , to the river Kishon , Sisera , the captain of Jabin 's army , with his chariots and his multitude ; and I will deliver him into your hand . ' "
Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh ; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet : and Deborah went up with him .
they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor .
Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles , to the river Kishon .
however Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite ; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
he said to her , " Please give me a little water to drink ; for I am thirsty . " she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
" because the leaders took the lead in Israel , because the people offered themselves willingly , be blessed , Yahweh !
" hear , you kings ! give ear , you princes ! I , even I , will sing to Yahweh . I will sing praise to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
" Yahweh , when you went forth out of Seir , when you marched out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , the sky also dropped . yes , the clouds dropped water .
the mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh , even Sinai , at the presence of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
" in the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were unoccupied . the travelers walked through byways .
my heart is toward the governors of Israel , who offered themselves willingly among the people . bless Yahweh !
" speak , you who ride on white donkeys , you who sit on rich carpets , and you who walk by the way .
'Awake , awake , Deborah ! awake , awake , utter a song ! arise , Barak , and lead away your captives , you son of Abinoam . '
" then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down . Yahweh came down for me against the mighty .
the princes of Issachar were with Deborah . as was Issachar , so was Barak . they rushed into the valley at his feet . by the watercourses of Reuben , there were great resolves of heart .
why did you sit among the sheepfolds , To hear the whistling for the flocks ? at the watercourses of Reuben There were great searchings of heart .
Gilead lived beyond the Jordan . why did Dan remain in ships ? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea , and lived by his creeks .
Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths ; Naphtali also , on the high places of the field .
" the kings came and fought , then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo . they took no plunder of silver .
'Curse Meroz , ' said the angel of Yahweh . ' curse bitterly its inhabitants , because they didn 't come to help Yahweh , to help Yahweh against the mighty . '
" Jael shall be blessed above women , the wife of Heber the Kenite ; blessed shall she be above women in the tent .
she put her hand to the tent peg , and her right hand to the workmen 's hammer . with the hammer she struck Sisera . she struck through his head . yes , she pierced and struck through his temples .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay . at her feet he bowed , he fell . where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
" through the window she looked out , and cried : Sisera 's mother looked through the lattice . ' why is his chariot so long in coming ? why do the wheels of his chariots wait ? '
" so let all your enemies perish , Yahweh , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest forty years .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years .
the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel ; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and the caves , and the strongholds .
so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east ; they came up against them ;
Israel was brought very low because of Midian ; and the children of Israel cried to Yahweh .
it happened , when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian ,
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all who oppressed you , and drove them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
the angel of Yahweh came , and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite : and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
the angel of Yahweh appeared to him , and said to him , " Yahweh is with you , you mighty man of valor ! "
he said to him , " If now I have found favor in your sight , then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me .
please don 't go away , until I come to you , and bring out my present , and lay it before you . " he said , " I will wait until you come back . "
the angel of God said to him , " Take the meat and the unleavened cakes , and lay them on this rock , and pour out the broth . " he did so .
Gideon saw that he was the angel of Yahweh ; and Gideon said , " Alas , Lord Yahweh ! because I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face ! "
and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold , in an orderly way , and take the second bull , and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down . "
they said one to another , " Who has done this thing ? " when they inquired and asked , they said , " Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing . "
therefore on that day he named him Jerub @-@ Baal , saying , " Let Baal contend against him , because he has broken down his altar . "
then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together ; and they passed over , and encamped in the valley of Jezreel .
but the Spirit of Yahweh came on Gideon ; and he blew a trumpet ; and Abiezer was gathered together after him .
he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; and they also were gathered together after him : and he sent messengers to Asher , and to Zebulun , and to Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
it was so ; for he rose up early on the next day , and pressed the Fleece together , and wrung the dew out of the Fleece , a bowl full of water .
but if you are afraid to go down , go with Purah your servant down to the camp :
the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude .
his fellow answered , " This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash , a man of Israel . God has delivered Midian into his hand , with all the army . "
he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets , and empty pitchers , with torches within the pitchers .
he said to them , " Watch me , and do likewise . behold , when I come to the outermost part of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so you shall do .
when I blow the trumpet , I and all who are with me , then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp , and shout , ' For Yahweh and for Gideon ! ' "
they each stood in his place around the camp ; and all the army ran ; and they shouted , and put them to flight .
the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after Midian .
Gideon came to the Jordan , and passed over , he , and the three hundred men who were with him , faint , yet pursuing .
he went up there to Penuel , and spoke to them in the same way ; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered .
he spoke also to the men of Penuel , saying , " When I come again in peace , I will break down this tower . "
Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and struck the army ; for the army was secure .
Zebah and Zalmunna fled ; and he pursued after them ; and he took the two kings of Midian , Zebah and Zalmunna , and confused all the army .
he caught a young man of the men of Succoth , and inquired of him : and he described for him the princes of Succoth , and its elders , seventy @-@ seven men .
he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he taught the men of Succoth .
he broke down the tower of Penuel , and killed the men of the city .
so Midian was subdued before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon .
Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body ; for he had many wives .
Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
it happened , as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and played the prostitute after the Baals , and made Baal Berith their god .
the children of Israel didn 't remember Yahweh their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side ;
neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal , Gideon , according to all the Goodness which he had shown to Israel .
Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith , with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows , who followed him .
all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together , and all the house of Millo , and went and made Abimelech king , by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem .
the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them ; and they said to the olive tree , ' reign over us . '
" the vine said to them , ' Should I leave my new wine , which cheers God and man , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
( for my father fought for you , and risked his life , and delivered you out of the hand of Midian :
if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then rejoice in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you :
Jotham ran away , and fled , and went to Beer , and lived there , for fear of Abimelech his brother .
God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech :
the men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers , and went over to Shechem ; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him .
would that this people were under my hand ! then I would remove Abimelech . " he said to Abimelech , " Increase your army , and come out ! "
when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , his anger was kindled .
he sent messengers to Abimelech craftily , saying , " behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem ; and behold , they incite the city against you .
now therefore , go up by night , you and the people who are with you , and lie in wait in the field :
Abimelech rose up , and all the people who were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies .
Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people who were with him , from the ambush .
it happened on the next day , that the people went out into the field ; and they told Abimelech .
Abimelech , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and killed the people who were therein : and he beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it , they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith .
it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and there fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut themselves in , and went up to the roof of the tower .
Abimelech came to the tower , and fought against it , and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , they departed every man to his place .
thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech , which he did to his father , in killing his seventy brothers ;
and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite on their heads : and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .
after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah , the son of Dodo , a man of Issachar ; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim .
he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts , and they had thirty cities , which are called Havvoth Jair to this day , which are in the land of Gilead .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the children of Ammon .
the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was very distressed .
Yahweh said to the children of Israel , " Didn 't I save you from the Egyptians , and from the Amorites , from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines ?
the Sidonians also , and the Amalekites , and the Maonites , oppressed you ; and you cried to me , and I saved you out of their hand .
go and cry to the gods which you have chosen . let them save you in the time of your distress ! "
the children of Israel said to Yahweh , " We have sinned : do you to us whatever seems good to you ; only deliver us , please , this day . "
they put away the foreign gods from among them , and served Yahweh ; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
then the children of Ammon were gathered together , and encamped in Gilead . the children of Israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in Mizpah .
the people , the princes of Gilead , said one to another , " What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . "
now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor , and he was the son of a prostitute : and Gilead became the father of Jephthah .
then Jephthah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah , and they went out with him .
it happened after a while , that the children of Ammon made war against Israel .
it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob ;
and they said to Jephthah , " Come and be our chief , that we may fight with the children of Ammon . "
Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , " If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon , and Yahweh deliver them before me , shall I be your head ? "
the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , " Yahweh shall be witness between us ; surely according to your word so will we do . "
then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and chief over them : and Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in Mizpah .
Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon ;
and he said to him , " Thus says Jephthah : Israel didn 't take away the land of Moab , nor the land of the children of Ammon ,
but when they came up from Egypt , and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea , and came to Kadesh ;
Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon ; and Israel said to him , ' Please let us pass through your land to my place . '
but Sihon didn 't trust Israel to pass through his border ; but Sihon gathered all his people together , and encamped in Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
they possessed all the border of the Amorites , from the Arnon even to the Jabbok , and from the wilderness even to the Jordan .
won 't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess ? so whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us , them will we possess .
now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ?
I therefore have not sinned against you , but you do me wrong to war against me . Yahweh , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon . "
however the king of the children of Ammon didn 't listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him .
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon .
Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh , and said , " If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand ,
so Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them ; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand .
he struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith , even twenty cities , and to Abelcheramim , with a very great slaughter . so the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel .
Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house ; and behold , his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances : and she was his only child ; besides her he had neither son nor daughter .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my companions . "
he said , " Go . " he sent her away for two months : and she departed , she and her companions , and mourned her virginity on the mountains .
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she was a virgin . it was a custom in Israel ,
Jephthah said to them , " I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon ; and when I called you , you didn 't save me out of their hand .
Jephthah judged Israel six years . then Jephthah the Gileadite died , and was buried in the cities of Gilead .
Elon the Zebulunite died , and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun .
he had forty sons and thirty sons ' sons , who rode on seventy donkey colts : and he judged Israel eight years .
Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the hill country of the Amalekites .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years .
there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and didn 't bear .
the angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman , and said to her , " See now , you are barren , and don 't bear ; but you shall conceive , and bear a son .
God listened to the voice of Manoah ; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field : but Manoah , her husband , wasn 't with her .
the woman made haste , and ran , and told her husband , and said to him , " behold , the man has appeared to me , who came to me that day . "
she may not eat of anything that comes of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing ; all that I commanded her let her observe . "
Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh , " Please , let us detain you , that we may make a young goat ready for you . "
so Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering , and offered it on the rock to Yahweh . then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on .
but the angel of Yahweh didn 't appear to Manoah or to his wife any more . then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh .
Samson went down to Timnah , and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines .
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
then went Samson down , and his father and his mother , to Timnah , and came to the vineyards of Timnah : and behold , a young lion roared against him .
he went down , and talked with the woman , and she pleased Samson well .
his father went down to the woman : and Samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
it happened , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
her father said , " I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated her ; therefore I gave her to your companion . Isn 't her younger sister more beautiful than she ? please take her , instead . "
Samson went and caught three hundred foxes , and took torches , and turned tail to tail , and put a torch in the midst between every two tails .
when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines , and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain , and also the olive groves .
he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam .
then the Philistines went up , and encamped in Judah , and spread themselves in Lehi .
he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men therewith .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand ; and that place was called Ramath Lehi .
it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
Delilah said to Samson , " Please tell me where your great strength lies , and what you might be bound to afflict you . "
Samson said to her , " If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
he said to her , " If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
it happened , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , that his soul was troubled to death .
however the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved .
the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god , and to rejoice ; for they said , " Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand . "
when the people saw him , they praised their god ; for they said , " Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country , who has slain many of us , into our hand . "
and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand , " allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house rests , that I may lean on them . "
Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested , and leaned on them , the one with his right hand , and the other with his left .
there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim , whose name was Micah .
the man Micah had a house of gods , and he made an ephod , and teraphim , and consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest .
in those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
there was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah , of the family of Judah , who was a Levite ; and he lived there .
the man departed out of the city , out of Bethlehem Judah , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he traveled .
Micah said to him , " Where did you come from ? " he said to him , " I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah , and I am looking for a place to live . "
the Levite was content to dwell with the man ; and the young man was to him as one of his sons .
Micah consecrated the Levite , and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of Micah .
he said to them , " Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me , and he has hired me , and I am become his priest . "
they said to him , " Please ask counsel of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous . "
the priest said to them , " Go in peace . your way in which you go is before Yahweh . "
there set forth from there of the family of the Danites , out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol , six hundred men girt with weapons of war .
they passed there to the hill country of Ephraim , and came to the house of Micah .
they turned aside there , and came to the house of the young man the Levite , even to the house of Micah , and asked him of his welfare .
the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
when these went into Micah 's house , and fetched the engraved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image , the priest said to them , " What are you doing ? "
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them .
they cried to the children of Dan . they turned their faces , and said to Micah , " What ails you , that you come with such a company ? "
the children of Dan went their way : and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his house .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was Laish at the first .
so they sat down , ate , and drank , both of them together : and the young lady 's father said to the man , " Please be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be merry . "
the man rose up to depart ; but his father @-@ in @-@ law urged him , and he lodged there again .
he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart ; and the young lady 's father said , " Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines " ; and they both ate .
when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said to his master , " Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it . "
so they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down on them near to Gibeah , which belongs to Benjamin .
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gibeah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim , and he lived in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjamites .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city ; and the old man said , " Where are you going ? where did you come from ? "
so he brought him into his house , and gave the donkeys fodder ; and they washed their feet , and ate and drink .
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , until it was light .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the Congregation was assembled as one man , from Dan even to Beersheba , with the land of Gilead , to Yahweh at Mizpah .
the chiefs of all the people , even of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . ) The children of Israel said , " Tell us , how did this wickedness happen ? "
the Levite , the husband of the woman who was murdered , answered , " I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin , I and my concubine , to lodge .
the men of Gibeah rose against me , and surrounded the house by night . they thought to have slain me , and they forced my concubine , and she is dead .
I took my concubine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel ; for they have committed lewdness and Folly in Israel .
all the people arose as one man , saying , " None of us will go to his tent , neither will any of us turn to his house .
but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah : we will go up against it by lot ;
so all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left @-@ handed ; everyone could sling stones at a hair @-@ breadth , and not miss .
the children of Israel rose up in the morning , and encamped against Gibeah .
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah .
the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty @-@ two thousand men .
the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves , and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day .
the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day .
Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again Eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was severe ; but they didn 't know that evil was close on them .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah .
the ambushers hurried , and rushed on Gibeah ; and the ambushers drew themselves along , and struck all the city with the edge of the sword .
now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city .
but when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them ; and behold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
the men of Israel turned , and the men of Benjamin were dismayed ; for they saw that evil had come on them .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst .
they surrounded the Benjamites , chased them , and trod them down at their resting place , as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrise .
so that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty @-@ five thousand men who drew the sword ; all these were men of valor .
but six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon , and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months .
now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah , saying , " There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife . "
the people came to Bethel , and sat there until evening before God , and lifted up their voices , and wept severely .
it happened on the next day that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother , and said , " There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
for when the people were numbered , behold , there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there .
this is the thing that you shall do : you shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman who has lain with a man . "
they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
the whole Congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon , and proclaimed peace to them .
then the elders of the Congregation said , " How shall we provide wives for those who remain , since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin ? "
they said , " There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel .
however we may not give them wives of our daughters , for the children of Israel had sworn , saying , ' Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin . ' "
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel departed there at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .
in those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
they took them wives of the women of Moab ; the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth : and they lived there about ten years .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters @-@ in @-@ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah .
Yahweh grant you that you may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . " then she kissed them , and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
Naomi said , " Go back , my daughters . why do you want to go with me ? do I still have sons in my womb , that they may be your husbands ?
they lifted up their voice , and wept again : and Orpah kissed her mother @-@ in @-@ law , but Ruth joined with her .
where you die , will I die , and there will I be buried . Yahweh do so to me , and more also , if anything but death part you and me . "
when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her , she left off speaking to her .
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . it happened , when they had come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they asked , " Is this Naomi ? "
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
Naomi had a kinsman of her husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of Elimelech , and his name was Boaz .
she went , and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz , who was of the family of Elimelech .
behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said to the reapers , " Yahweh be with you . " they answered him , " Yahweh bless you . "
the servant who was set over the reapers answered , " It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab .
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
May Yahweh repay your work , and a full reward be given you from Yahweh , the God of Israel , under whose wings you have come to take refuge . "
then she said , " Let me find favor in your sight , my lord , because you have comforted me , and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid , though I am not as one of your handmaidens . "
when she had risen up to glean , Boaz commanded his young men , saying , " Let her glean even among the sheaves , and don 't reproach her .
also pull out some for her from the bundles , and leave it , and let her glean , and don 't rebuke her . "
Ruth the Moabitess said , " Yes , he said to me , ' You shall stay close to my young men , until they have ended all my harvest . ' "
so she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz , to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and she lived with her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Naomi her mother @-@ in @-@ law said to her , " My daughter , shall I not seek rest for you , that it may be well with you ?
therefore wash yourself , anoint yourself , get dressed , and go down to the threshing floor , but don 't make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
she went down to the threshing floor , and did according to all that her mother @-@ in @-@ law told her .
it happened at midnight , that the man was startled and turned himself ; and behold , a woman lay at his feet .
he said , " blessed are you by Yahweh , my daughter . you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning , inasmuch as you didn 't follow young men , whether poor or rich .
now , my daughter , don 't be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman .
now it is true that I am a near kinsman ; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.
he said to the near kinsman , " Naomi , who has come back out of the country of Moab , is selling the parcel of land , which was our brother Elimelech 's .
let your house be like the house of Perez , whom Tamar bore to Judah , of the seed which Yahweh shall give you of this young woman . "
so Boaz took Ruth , and she became his wife ; and he went in to her , and Yahweh gave her conception , and she bore a son .
the women said to Naomi , " blessed be Yahweh , who has not left you this day without a near kinsman ; and let his name be famous in Israel .
Naomi took the child , and laid it in her bosom , and became nurse to it .
the women , her neighbors , gave him a name , saying , " There is a son born to Naomi " ; and they named him Obed . he is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
now this is the history of the generations of Perez : Perez became the father of Hezron ,
and Hezron became the father of Ram , and Ram became the father of Amminadab ,
and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon , and Nahshon became the father of salmon ,
and salmon became the father of Boaz , and Boaz became the father of Obed ,
when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed , he gave to Peninnah his wife , and to all her sons and her daughters , portions :
but to Hannah he gave a double portion ; for he loved Hannah , but Yahweh had shut up her womb .
as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of Yahweh , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and didn 't eat .
so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk . now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh 's temple .
she was in bitterness of soul , and prayed to Yahweh , and wept bitterly .
it happened , as she continued praying before Yahweh , that Eli saw her mouth .
now Hannah spoke in her heart . only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard . therefore Eli thought she had been drunken .
Eli said to her , " How long will you be drunken ? put away your wine from you . "
Don 't count your handmaid for a wicked woman ; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation . "
she said , " Let your handmaid find favor in your sight . " so the woman went her way , and ate ; and her facial expression wasn 't sad any more .
it happened , when the time had come , that Hannah conceived , and bore a son ; and she named him Samuel , saying , " Because I have asked him of Yahweh . "
the man Elkanah , and all his house , went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice , and his vow .
but Hannah didn 't go up ; for she said to her husband , " Not until the child is weaned ; then I will bring him , that he may appear before Yahweh , and stay there forever . "
when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bulls , and one ephah of meal , and a bottle of wine , and brought him to Yahweh 's house in Shiloh . the child was young .
she said , " Oh , my lord , as your soul lives , my lord , I am the woman who stood by you here , praying to Yahweh .
for this child I prayed ; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him .
there is no one as holy as Yahweh , For there is no one besides you , nor is there any rock like our God .
" talk no more so exceeding proudly . Don 't let arrogance come out of your mouth , For Yahweh is a God of knowledge . by him actions are weighed .
" the bows of the mighty men are broken . those who stumbled are armed with strength .
those who were full have hired themselves out for bread . those who were hungry are satisfied . yes , the barren has borne seven . she who has many children languishes .
" Yahweh kills , and makes alive . he brings down to Sheol , and brings up .
he will keep the feet of his holy ones , but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness ; for no man shall prevail by strength .
and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith . so they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there .
the sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh ; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh .
moreover his mother made him a little robe , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
now Eli was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of Meeting .
no , my sons ; for it is no good report that I hear : you make Yahweh 's people disobey .
the child Samuel grew on , and increased in favor both with Yahweh , and also with men .
a man of God came to Eli , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' did I reveal myself to the house of your father , when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh 's house ?
behold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
you shall see the affliction of my habitation , in all the wealth which I shall give Israel ; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever .
" ' this shall be the sign to you , that shall come on your two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas : in one day they shall both die .
I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my anointed forever .
it happened at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place ( now his eyes had begun to grow dim , so that he could not see ) ,
and the lamp of God hadn 't yet gone out , and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh 's temple , where the Ark of God was ;
Yahweh called Samuel again the third time . he arose and went to Eli , and said , " Here I am ; for you called me . " Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child .
Yahweh said to Samuel , " behold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle .
in that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house , from the beginning even to the end .
for I have told him that I will judge his house forever , for the iniquity which he knew , because his sons brought a curse on themselves , and he didn 't restrain them .
Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh . Samuel feared to show Eli the vision .
the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Philistines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
when the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
the Philistines were afraid , for they said , " God has come into the camp . " they said , " Woe to us ! for there has not been such a thing before .
Woe to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness .
the Philistines fought , and Israel was struck , and they fled every man to his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
the Ark of God was taken ; and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were slain .
there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Shiloh the same day , with his clothes torn , and with earth on his head .
when Eli heard the noise of the crying , he said , " What does the noise of this tumult mean ? " the man hurried , and came and told Eli .
now Eli was ninety @-@ eight years old ; and his eyes were set , so that he could not see .
about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her , " Don 't be afraid ; for you have given birth to a son . " but she didn 't answer , neither did she regard it .
the Philistines took the Ark of God , and brought it into the house of Dagon , and set it by Dagon .
when they of Ashdod arose early on the next day , behold , Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the Ark of Yahweh . they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any who come into Dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod , to this day .
the men who didn 't die were struck with the tumors ; and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , " What shall we do with the Ark of Yahweh ? show us with which we shall send it to its place . "
" now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart , and two milk cows , on which there has come no yoke ; and tie the cows to the cart , and bring their calves home from them ;
the men did so , and took two milk cows , and tied them to the cart , and shut up their calves at home ;
and they put the Ark of Yahweh on the cart , and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors .
they of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley ; and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ark , and rejoiced to see it .
the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they split the wood of the cart , and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it , they returned to Ekron the same day .
these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to Yahweh : for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Ashkelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ;
the men of Kiriath Jearim came , and fetched up the Ark of Yahweh , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the Ark of Yahweh .
it happened , from the day that the Ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don 't cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines . "
as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel ; but Yahweh thundered with a great Thunder on that day on the Philistines , and confused them ; and they were struck down before Israel .
the men of Israel went out of Mizpah , and pursued the Philistines , and struck them , until they came under Beth Kar .
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more within the border of Israel . the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel , from Ekron even to Gath ; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines . there was peace between Israel and the Amorites .
he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal , and Mizpah ; and he judged Israel in all those places .
his return was to Ramah , for there was his house ; and there he judged Israel : and he built there an altar to Yahweh .
it happened , when Samuel was old , that he made his sons judges over Israel .
now the name of his firstborn was Joel ; and the name of his second , Abijah : they were judges in Beersheba .
Yahweh said to Samuel , " listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
now therefore listen to their voice : however you shall protest solemnly to them , and shall show them the way of the king who shall reign over them . "
Samuel told all the words of Yahweh to the people who asked of him a king .
he will take your daughters to be perfumers , and to be cooks , and to be Bakers .
he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your olive groves , even their best , and give them to his servants .
he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your donkeys , and put them to his work .
that we also may be like all the nations , and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles . "
Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh .
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
when they had come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant who was with him , " Come , and let us return , lest my father stop caring about the donkeys , and be anxious for us . "
then Saul said to his servant , " Well said . come , let us go . " so they went to the city where the man of God was .
as they went up the ascent to the city , they found young maidens going out to draw water , and said to them , " Is the seer here ? "
they went up to the city . as they came within the city , behold , Samuel came out toward them , to go up to the high place .
when they had come down from the high place into the city , he talked with Saul on the housetop .
and they will greet you , and give you two loaves of bread , which you shall receive of their hand .
and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you , and you shall prophesy with them , and shall be turned into another man .
let it be , when these signs have come to you , that you do as occasion shall serve you ; for God is with you .
when they came there to the hill , behold , a band of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him , and he prophesied among them .
when he had made an end of prophesying , he came to the high place .
they ran and fetched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yahweh . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
Saul also went to his house to Gibeah ; and there went with him the army , whose hearts God had touched .
then Nahash the Ammonite came up , and encamped against Jabesh Gilead : and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash , " Make a Covenant with us , and we will serve you . "
then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul , and spoke these words in the ears of the people : and all the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
behold , Saul came following the oxen out of the field ; and Saul said , " What ails the people that they weep ? " they told him the words of the men of Jabesh .
he numbered them in Bezek ; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
therefore the men of Jabesh said , " Tomorrow we will come out to you , and you shall do with us all that seems good to you . "
the people said to Samuel , " Who is he who said , ' shall Saul reign over us ? ' bring those men , that we may put them to death ! "
Samuel said to all Israel , " behold , I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me , and have made a king over you .
he said to them , " Yahweh is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that you have not found anything in my hand . " they said , " He is witness . "
Samuel said to the people , " It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh , which he did to you and to your fathers .
" when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , you said to me , ' No , but a king shall reign over us ; ' when Yahweh your God was your king .
now therefore see the king whom you have chosen , and whom you have asked for : and behold , Yahweh has set a king over you .
if you will fear Yahweh , and serve him , and listen to his voice , and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh , but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then will the hand of Yahweh be against you , as it was against your fathers .
Don 't turn aside to go after vain things which can 't profit nor deliver , for they are vain .
for Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name 's sake , because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself .
moreover as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you : but I will instruct you in the good and the right way .
Saul reigned a year ; and when he had reigned two years over Israel ,
Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba : and the Philistines heard of it . Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land , saying , " Let the Hebrews hear ! "
all Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines , and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines . the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in coverts , and in pits .
now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead ; but as for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
he stayed seven days , according to the time set by Samuel : but Samuel didn 't come to Gilgal ; and the people were scattered from him .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might greet him .
therefore I said , ' Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal , and I haven 't entreated the favor of Yahweh . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the burnt offering . "
Samuel said to Saul , " You have done foolishly . you have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God , which he commanded you ; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever .
but now your kingdom shall not continue . Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart , and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people , because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you . "
Samuel arose , and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin . Saul numbered the people who were present with him , about six hundred men .
Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people who were present with them , stayed in Geba of Benjamin : but the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah , to the land of Shual ;
now there was no Smith found throughout all the land of Israel ; for the Philistines said , " Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears " ;
yet they had a file for the mattocks , and for the plowshares , and for the forks , and for the axes , and to set the goads .
Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron : and the people who were with him were about six hundred men ;
the one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash , and the other on the south in front of Geba .
but if they say this , ' Come up to us ! ' then we will go up ; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand . this shall be the sign to us . "
both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines : and the Philistines said , " behold , the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves ! "
that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armor bearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were half a furrow 's length in an acre of land .
the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked ; and behold , the multitude melted away , and scattered .
then Saul said to the people who were with him , " Count now , and see who is missing from us . " when they had counted , behold , Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there .
Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together , and came to the battle : and behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow : a very great confusion .
now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
how much more , if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found ? for now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines . "
and the people flew on the spoil , and took sheep , and cattle , and calves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
for , as Yahweh lives , who saves Israel , though it is in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die . " but there was not a man among all the people who answered him .
he did valiantly , and struck the Amalekites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishvi , and Malchishua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz . the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
Kish was the father of Saul ; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel .
there was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any mighty man , or any valiant man , he took him to him .
Samuel said to Saul , " Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people , over Israel . now therefore listen to the voice of the words of Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , ' I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel , how he set himself against him in the way , when he came up out of Egypt .
Saul came to the city of Amalek , and laid wait in the valley .
Saul struck the Amalekites , from Havilah as you go to Shur , that is before Egypt .
he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive , and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
Samuel came to Saul ; and Saul said to him , " You are blessed by Yahweh ! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh . "
Samuel said , " Though you were little in your own sight , weren 't you made the head of the tribes of Israel ? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel ;
and Yahweh sent you on a journey , and said , ' Go , and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites , and fight against them until they are consumed . '
why then didn 't you obey the voice of Yahweh , but took the spoils , and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ? "
Samuel said to Saul , " I will not return with you ; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh , and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel . "
as Samuel turned about to go away , Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe , and it tore .
Samuel said to him , " Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day , and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you .
then he said , " I have sinned : yet please honor me now before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and come back with me , that I may worship Yahweh your God . "
Samuel said , " As your sword has made women childless , so your mother will be childless among women ! " Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal .
then Samuel went to Ramah ; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul .
then Samuel took the Horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brothers : and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
Saul said to his servants , " Provide me now a man who can play well , and bring him to me . "
Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread , and a bottle of wine , and a young goat , and sent them by David his son to Saul .
now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle ; and they were gathered together at Socoh , which belongs to Judah , and encamped between Socoh and Azekah , in Ephesdammim .
Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and encamped in the valley of Elah , and set the battle in array against the Philistines .
the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
he had a helmet of brass on his head , and he was clad with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
he had brass shin armor on his legs , and a javelin of brass between his shoulders .
the staff of his spear was like a weaver 's beam ; and his spear 's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and his shield bearer went before him .
now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Saul , stricken among men .
the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next to him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
Jesse said to David his son , " Now take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain , and these ten loaves , and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers ;
now Saul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array , army against army .
David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the ranks of the Philistines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were terrified .
the people answered him in this way , saying , " So shall it be done to the man who kills him . "
he turned away from him toward another , and spoke like that again ; and the people answered him again the same way .
when the words were heard which David spoke , they rehearsed them before Saul ; and he sent for him .
David said to Saul , " Let no man 's heart fail because of him . your servant will go and fight with this Philistine . "
Saul said to David , " You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him ; for you are but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth . "
your servant struck both the lion and the bear . this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them , since he has defied the armies of the living God . "
Saul dressed David with his clothing . he put a helmet of brass on his head , and he clad him with a coat of mail .
the Philistine came on and drew near to David ; and the man who bore the shield went before him .
when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him ; for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and withal of a fair face .
the Philistine said to David , " Am I a dog , that you come to me with sticks ? " the Philistine Cursed David by his gods .
and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn 't save with sword and spear : for the battle is Yahweh 's , and he will give you into our hand . "
it happened , when the Philistine arose , and came and drew near to meet David , that David hurried , and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and slung it , and struck the Philistine in his forehead ; and the stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the earth .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and struck the Philistine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines , and they plundered their camp .
as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , Abner took him , and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking to Saul , that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul .
Saul took him that day , and would let him go no more home to his father 's house .
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clothing , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his sash .
and Saul threw the spear ; for he said , " I will pin David even to the wall ! " David escaped from his presence twice .
Saul was afraid of David , because Yahweh was with him , and was departed from Saul .
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely , he stood in awe of him .
but it happened at the time when Merab , Saul 's daughter , should have been given to David , that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife .
the servants of Saul told him , saying , " David spoke like this . "
when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law . the days were not expired ;
Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David ; and Michal , Saul 's daughter , loved him .
I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan : and Saul swore , " As Yahweh lives , he shall not be put to death . "
there was war again . David went out , and fought with the Philistines , and killed them with a great slaughter ; and they fled before him .
an evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul , as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand ; and David was playing with his hand .
Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he stuck the spear into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
so Michal let David down through the window . he went , fled , and escaped .
Michal took the teraphim , and laid it in the bed , and put a pillow of goats ' hair at its head , and covered it with the clothes .
Saul sent the messengers to see David , saying , " Bring him up to me in the bed , that I may kill him . "
when the messengers came in , behold , the teraphim was in the bed , with the pillow of goats ' hair at its head .
now David fled , and escaped , and came to Samuel to Ramah , and told him all that Saul had done to him . he and Samuel went and lived in Naioth .
it was told Saul , saying , " behold , David is at Naioth in Ramah . "
he went there to Naioth in Ramah . then the Spirit of God came on him also , and he went on , and prophesied , until he came to Naioth in Ramah .
if your father miss me at all , then say , ' David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city ; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family . '
you shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness of Yahweh , that I not die ;
but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever ; no , not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth . "
so Jonathan made a Covenant with the house of David , saying , " Yahweh will require it at the hand of David 's enemies . "
Jonathan caused David to swear again , for the love that he had to him ; for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
I will shoot three arrows on its side , as though I shot at a mark .
concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of , behold , Yahweh is between you and me forever . "
so David hid himself in the field : and when the new moon had come , the king sat him down to eat food .
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jonathan stood up , and Abner sat by Saul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
for as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth , you shall not be established , nor your kingdom . therefore now send and bring him to me , for he shall surely die ! "
Jonathan answered Saul his father , and said to him , " Why should he be put to death ? what has he done ? "
Saul cast his spear at him to strike him . by this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death .
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and ate no food the second day of the month ; for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
it happened in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little boy with him .
when the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the boy , and said , " Isn 't the arrow beyond you ? "
Jonathan cried after the boy , " Go fast ! hurry ! Don 't delay ! " Jonathan 's boy gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
but the boy didn 't know anything . only Jonathan and David knew the matter .
Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy , and said to him , " Go , carry them to the city . "
now therefore what is under your hand ? give me five loaves of bread in my hand , or whatever there is present . "
the priest answered David , and said , " There is no common bread under my hand , but there is holy bread ; if only the young men have kept themselves from women . "
now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before Yahweh ; and his name was Doeg the Edomite , the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul .
David arose , and fled that day for fear of Saul , and went to Achish the king of Gath .
David therefore departed there , and escaped to the cave of Adullam . when his brothers and all his father 's house heard it , they went down there to him .
the prophet Gad said to David , " Don 't stay in the stronghold . depart , and go into the land of Judah . " then David departed , and came into the forest of Hereth .
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " Hear now , you Benjamites ! will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ,
then Doeg the Edomite , who stood by the servants of Saul , answered and said , " I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob , to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub .
then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests who were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
one of the sons of Ahimelech , the son of Ahitub , named Abiathar , escaped , and fled after David .
stay with me , don 't be afraid ; for he who seeks my life seeks your life . for with me you shall be in safeguard . "
David was told , " behold , the Philistines are fighting against Keilah , and are robbing the threshing floors . "
David and his men went to Keilah , and fought with the Philistines , and brought away their livestock , and killed them with a great slaughter . so David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
it happened , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah . Saul said , " God has delivered him into my hand ; for he is shut in , by entering into a town that has gates and bars . "
Saul summoned all the people to war , to go down to Keilah , to besiege David and his men .
David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds , and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph . Saul sought him every day , but God didn 't deliver him into his hand .
David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life . David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood .
Jonathan , Saul 's son , arose , and went to David into the woods , and strengthened his hand in God .
then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah , saying , " Doesn 't David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of the desert ?
please go make yet more sure , and know and see his place where his haunt is , and who has seen him there ; for it is told me that he deals very subtly .
they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the Arabah on the south of the desert .
Saul and his men went to seek him . when David was told , he went down to the rock , and stayed in the wilderness of Maon . when Saul heard that , he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon .
but a messenger came to Saul , saying , " hurry and come ; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land ! "
it happened , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , " behold , David is in the wilderness of En Gedi . "
then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats .
it happened afterward , that David 's heart struck him , because he had cut off Saul 's skirt .
so David checked his men with these words , and didn 't allow them to rise against Saul . Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
David said to Saul , " Why do you listen to men 's words , saying , ' behold , David seeks your hurt ? '
May Yahweh judge between me and you , and may Yahweh avenge me of you ; but my hand shall not be on you .
as the proverb of the ancients says , ' Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness ; ' but my hand shall not be on you .
May Yahweh therefore be judge , and give sentence between me and you , and see , and plead my cause , and deliver me out of your hand . "
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul , that Saul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me , because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand , you didn 't kill me .
for if a man finds his enemy , will he let him go away unharmed ? therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day .
now , behold , I know that you shall surely be king , and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand .
swear now therefore to me by Yahweh , that you will not cut off my seed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was Shearing his sheep in Carmel .
David sent ten young men , and David said to the young men , " Go up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name .
you shall tell him , ' Long life to you ! peace be to you , and peace be to your house , and peace be to all that you have .
when David 's young men came , they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David , and ceased .
so David 's young men turned on their way , and went back , and came and told him according to all these words .
but one of the young men told Abigail , Nabal 's wife , saying , " behold , David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master ; and he railed at them .
they were a wall to us both by night and by day , all the while we were with them keeping the sheep .
now therefore know and consider what you will do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his house ; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can 't speak to him . "
God do so to the enemies of David , and more also , if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall . "
when Abigail saw David , she hurried , and alighted from her donkey , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground .
now this present which your servant has brought to my lord , let it be given to the young men who follow my lord .
please forgive the trespass of your handmaid . for Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house , because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh ; and evil shall not be found in you all your days .
it shall come to pass , when Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you , and shall have appointed you prince over Israel ,
blessed is your discretion , and blessed are you , that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness , and from avenging myself with my own hand .
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " Go up in peace to your house . behold , I have listened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
it happened about ten days after , that Yahweh struck Nabal , so that he died .
when the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel , they spoke to her , saying , " David has sent us to you , to take you to him as wife . "
she arose , and bowed herself with her face to the earth , and said , " behold , your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord . "
Abigail hurried , and arose , and rode on a donkey , with five ladies of hers who followed her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah , saying , " Doesn 't David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah , which is before the desert ? "
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah , which is before the desert , by the way . but David stayed in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
David said , " As Yahweh lives , Yahweh will strike him ; or his day shall come to die ; or he shall go down into battle and perish .
then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of the mountain afar off ; a great space being between them ;
he said , " Why does my lord pursue after his servant ? for what have I done ? or what evil is in my hand ?
now therefore , don 't let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh ; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea , as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains . "
Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness ; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today , and I wouldn 't put forth my hand against Yahweh 's anointed .
behold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yahweh , and let him deliver me out of all oppression . "
David arose , and passed over , he and the six hundred men who were with him , to Achish the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
David lived with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife .
it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath : and he sought no more again for him .
the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months .
David struck the land , and saved neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the cattle , and the donkeys , and the camels , and the clothing ; and he returned , and came to Achish .
Achish said , " Against whom have you made a raid today ? " David said , " Against the South of Judah , against the South of the Jerahmeelites , and against the South of the Kenites . "
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
the Philistines gathered themselves together , and came and encamped in Shunem : and Saul gathered all Israel together , and they encamped in Gilboa .
when Saul saw the army of the Philistines , he was afraid , and his heart trembled greatly .
when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice ; and the woman spoke to Saul , saying , " Why have you deceived me ? for you are Saul ! "
Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me . Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand , and given it to your neighbor , even to David .
because you didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , and didn 't execute his fierce wrath on Amalek , therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day .
now therefore , please listen also to the voice of your handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
the woman had a fattened calf in the house . she hurried and killed it ; and she took flour , and kneaded it , and baked unleavened bread of it .
she brought it before Saul , and before his servants ; and they ate . then they rose up , and went away that night .
now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek : and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel .
the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds , and by thousands ; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , depart . "
so David rose up early , he and his men , to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the Philistines . the Philistines went up to Jezreel .
it happened , when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South , and on Ziklag , and had struck Ziklag , and burned it with fire ,
and had taken captive the women and all who were therein , both small and great . they didn 't kill any , but carried them off , and went their way .
when David and his men came to the city , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captive .
then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
David 's two wives were taken captive , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite .
they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he ate ; and they gave him water to drink .
we made a raid on the South of the Cherethites , and on that which belongs to Judah , and on the South of Caleb ; and we burned Ziklag with fire . "
David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who rode on camels and fled .
there was nothing lacking to them , neither small nor great , neither sons nor daughters , neither spoil , nor anything that they had taken to them . David brought back all .
it was so from that day forward , that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day .
when David came to Ziklag , he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah , even to his friends , saying , " behold , a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh . "
and to those who were in Hormah , and to those who were in Borashan , and to those who were in Athach ,
and to those who were in Hebron , and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay .
now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa .
the Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
the battle went hard against Saul , and the archers overtook him ; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers .
when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead , he likewise fell on his sword , and died with him .
so Saul died , and his three sons , and his armor bearer , and all his men , that same day together .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth ; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan .
when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul ,
it happened after the death of Saul , when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had stayed two days in Ziklag ;
David said to him , " Where do you come from ? " he said to him , " I have escaped out of the camp of Israel . "
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa , behold , Saul was leaning on his spear ; and behold , the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him .
when he looked behind him , he saw me , and called to me . I answered , ' Here I am . '
he said to me , ' Please stand beside me , and kill me ; for anguish has taken hold of me , because my life is yet whole in me . '
then David took hold on his clothes , and tore them ; and likewise all the men who were with him .
they mourned , and wept , and fasted until evening , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Yahweh , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
David called one of the young men , and said , " Go near , and fall on him . " he struck him , so that he died .
( and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jashar ) :
from the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , Jonathan 's bow didn 't turn back . Saul 's sword didn 't return empty .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives . in their death , they were not divided . they were swifter than eagles . they were stronger than lions .
how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle ! Jonathan is slain on your high places .
I am distressed for you , my brother Jonathan . you have been very pleasant to me . your love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
so David went up there , and his two wives also , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite .
David brought up his men who were with him , every man with his household . they lived in the cities of Hebron .
the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . they told David , saying , " The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul . "
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead , and said to them , " blessed are you by Yahweh , that you have shown this kindness to your lord , even to Saul , and have buried him .
now may Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you . I also will reward you for this kindness , because you have done this thing .
now therefore let your hands be strong , and be valiant ; for Saul your lord is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them . "
now Abner the son of Ner , captain of Saul 's army , had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and brought him over to Mahanaim ;
Ishbosheth , Saul 's son , was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel , and he reigned two years . but the house of Judah followed David .
the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months .
Abner the son of Ner , and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul , went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon .
then they arose and went over by number : twelve for Benjamin , and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and twelve of the servants of David .
they each caught his opponent by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
the battle was very severe that day : and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
the three sons of Zeruiah were there , Joab , and Abishai , and Asahel : and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle .
Asahel pursued after Abner ; and in going he didn 't turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
Abner said again to Asahel , " Turn aside from following me . why should I strike you to the ground ? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother ? "
but Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah , that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon .
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner , and became one band , and stood on the top of a hill .
Joab said , " As God lives , if you had not spoken , surely then in the morning the people would have gone away , and not each followed his brother . "
Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah ; and they passed over the Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and came to Mahanaim .
Joab returned from following Abner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David 's servants nineteen men and Asahel .
but the servants of David had struck of Benjamin , and of Abner 's men , so that three hundred sixty men died .
they took up Asahel , and buried him in the tomb of his father , which was in Bethlehem . Joab and his men went all night , and the day broke on them at Hebron .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : and David grew stronger and stronger , but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker .
and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
and the sixth , Ithream , of Eglah , David 's wife . these were born to David in Hebron .
it happened , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul .
now Saul had a concubine , whose name was Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah : and Ishbosheth said to Abner , " Why have you gone in to my father 's concubine ? "
her husband went with her , weeping as he went , and followed her to Bahurim . then Abner said to him , " Go ! return ! " and he returned .
Abner had communication with the elders of Israel , saying , " In times past , you sought for David to be king over you .
Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
so Abner came to David to Hebron , and twenty men with him . David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast .
you know Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive you , and to know your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you do . "
when Joab had come out from David , he sent messengers after Abner , and they brought him back from the well of Sirah ; but David didn 't know it .
afterward , when David heard it , he said , " I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner .
so Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner , because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle .
David said to Joab , and to all the people who were with him , Tear your clothes , and clothe yourselves with sackcloth , and mourn before Abner . King David followed the Bier .
they buried Abner in Hebron : and the king lifted up his voice , and wept at the grave of Abner ; and all the people wept .
your hands were not bound , nor your feet put into fetters . as a man falls before the children of iniquity , so you fell . " all the people wept again over him .
all the people took notice of it , and it pleased them ; as whatever the king did pleased all the people .
so all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner .
the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth , as he took his rest at noon .
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed , shall I not now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ? "
then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron , and spoke , saying , " behold , we are your bone and your flesh .
so all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron ; and king David made a Covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh ; and they anointed David king over Israel .
in Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months ; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty @-@ three years over all Israel and Judah .
nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion ; the same is the city of David .
David grew greater and greater ; for Yahweh , the God of Armies , was with him .
David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel 's sake .
David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem , after he had come from Hebron ; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David .
these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , and Nathan , and Solomon ,
when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the stronghold .
now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
the Philistines came up yet again , and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
when David inquired of Yahweh , he said , " You shall not go up . circle around behind them , and attack them over against the mulberry trees .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall stir yourself up ; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
they set the Ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drove the new cart .
when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon , Uzzah reached for the Ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the cattle stumbled .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah ; and God struck him there for his error ; and there he died by the Ark of God .
David was displeased , because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah ; and he called that place Perez Uzzah , to this day .
so David would not move the Ark of Yahweh to be with him in the city of David ; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
the Ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite three months : and Yahweh blessed Obed @-@ Edom , and all his house .
it was so , that , when those who bore the Ark of Yahweh had gone six paces , he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf .
David danced before Yahweh with all his might ; and David was clothed in a linen ephod .
so David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of Yahweh with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet .
they brought in the Ark of Yahweh , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies .
I will be yet more vile than this , and will be base in my own sight . but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken , they shall honor me . "
it happened , when the king lived in his house , and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around ,
it happened the same night , that the word of Yahweh came to Nathan , saying ,
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle .
now therefore you shall tell my servant David this , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " I took you from the sheep pen , from following the sheep , that you should be prince over my people , over Israel .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sleep with your fathers , I will set up your seed after you , who shall proceed out of your bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
but my loving kindness shall not depart from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before you .
your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you . your throne shall be established forever . " ' "
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so Nathan spoke to David .
then David the king went in , and sat before Yahweh ; and he said , " Who am I , Lord Yahweh , and what is my house , that you have brought me thus far ?
for your word 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make your servant know it .
therefore you are great , Yahweh God . for there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
now , Yahweh God , the word that you have spoken concerning your servant , and concerning his house , confirm it forever , and do as you have spoken .
for you , Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , have revealed to your servant , saying , ' I will build you a house . ' therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you .
" now , O Lord Yahweh , you are God , and your words are truth , and you have promised this good thing to your servant .
after this it happened that David struck the Philistines , and subdued them : and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines .
David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob , king of Zobah , as he went to recover his dominion at the River .
David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen : and David hamstrung all the chariot horses , but reserved of them for one hundred chariots .
when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men .
then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus ; and the Syrians became servants to David , and brought tribute . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went .
David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
David earned a reputation when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt , even Eighteen thousand men .
he put garrisons in Edom ; throughout all Edom put he garrisons , and all the Edomites became servants to David . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went .
David reigned over all Israel ; and David executed justice and righteousness to all his people .
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder ;
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , were priests ; and Seraiah was scribe ;
then king David sent , and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , from Lo Debar .
then the king called to Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said to him , " All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master 's son .
Mephibosheth had a young son , whose name was Mica . all that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth .
so Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem ; for he ate continually at the king 's table . he was lame in both his feet .
it happened after this , that the king of the children of Ammon died , and Hanun his son reigned in his place .
so Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
when they told it to David , he sent to meet them ; for the men were greatly ashamed . the king said , " wait at Jericho until your beards have grown , and then return . "
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians :
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother ; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God ; and Yahweh do that which seems good to him . "
so Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians : and they fled before him .
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai , and entered into the city . then Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
when the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel , they gathered themselves together .
Hadadezer sent , and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River : and they came to Helam , with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came to Helam . the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
it happened at evening , that David arose from off his bed , and walked on the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he saw a woman bathing ; and the woman was very beautiful to look on .
David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in to him , and he lay with her ( for she was purified from her uncleanness ) ; and she returned to her house .
when Uriah had come to him , David asked of him how Joab did , and how the people fared , and how the war prospered .
David said to Uriah , " Go down to your house , and wash your feet . " Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
but Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and didn 't go down to his house .
it happened in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Joab , and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
he wrote in the letter , saying , " Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle , and retreat from him , that he may be struck , and die . "
it happened , when Joab kept watch on the city , that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were .
and he commanded the messenger , saying , " When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king ,
it shall be that , if the king 's wrath arise , and he asks you , ' Why did you go so near to the city to fight ? Didn 't you know that they would shoot from the wall ?
the messenger said to David , " The men prevailed against us , and came out to us into the field , and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate .
the shooters shot at your servants from off the wall ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also . "
when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead , she made lamentation for her husband .
Yahweh sent Nathan to David . he came to him , and said to him , " There were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
David 's anger was greatly kindled against the man , and he said to Nathan , " As Yahweh lives , the man who has done this is worthy to die !
he shall restore the lamb fourfold , because he did this thing , and because he had no pity ! "
now therefore the sword will never depart from your house , because you have despised me , and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife . '
however , because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh 's enemies to blaspheme , the child also who is born to you shall surely die . "
Nathan departed to his house . Yahweh struck the child that Uriah 's wife bore to David , and it was very sick .
David therefore begged God for the child ; and David fasted , and went in , and lay all night on the earth .
the elders of his house arose beside him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
then his servants said to him , " What is this that you have done ? you fasted and wept for the child while he was alive ; but when the child was dead , you rose up and ate bread . "
Joab sent messengers to David , and said , " I have fought against Rabbah . yes , I have taken the city of waters .
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and encamp against the city , and take it ; lest I take the city , and it be called after my name . "
David gathered all the people together , and went to Rabbah , and fought against it , and took it .
it happened after this , that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister , whose name was Tamar ; and Amnon the son of David loved her .
Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar ; for she was a virgin ; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her .
but Amnon had a friend , whose name was Jonadab , the son of Shimeah , David 's brother ; and Jonadab was a very subtle man .
she took the pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . Amnon said , " Have all men leave me . " every man went out from him .
Amnon said to Tamar , " Bring the food into the room , that I may eat from your hand . " Tamar took the cakes which she had made , and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother .
when she had brought them near to him to eat , he took hold of her , and said to her , " Come , lie with me , my sister ! "
she answered him , " No , my brother , do not force me ! for no such thing ought to be done in Israel . Don 't you do this Folly .
however he would not listen to her voice ; but being stronger than she , he forced her , and lay with her .
then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred ; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her . Amnon said to her , " arise , be gone ! "
then he called his servant who ministered to him , and said , " Put now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her . "
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were virgins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
but when king David heard of all these things , he was very angry .
it happened after two full years , that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor , which is beside Ephraim : and Absalom invited all the king 's sons .
the king said to Absalom , " No , my son , let us not all go , lest we be burdensome to you . " he pressed him ; however he would not go , but blessed him .
but Absalom pressed him , and he let Amnon and all the king 's sons go with him .
the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man got up on his mule , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Absalom has slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
then the king arose , and tore his garments , and lay on the earth ; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn .
now therefore don 't let my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead ; for Amnon only is dead . "
but Absalom fled . the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold , many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him .
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and wept . the king also and all his servants wept bitterly .
but Absalom fled , and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur , king of Geshur . David mourned for his son every day .
go in to the king , and speak like this to him . " so Joab put the words in her mouth .
when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , showed respect , and said , " Help , O king ! "
the king said to the woman , " Go to your house , and I will give a command concerning you . "
for the king will hear , to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing . my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . "
the king said , " Let him return to his own house , but let him not see my face . " so Absalom returned to his own house , and didn 't see the king 's face .
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
to Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a beautiful face .
Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem ; and he didn 't see the king 's face .
then Absalom sent for Joab , to send him to the king ; but he would not come to him : and he sent again a second time , but he would not come .
then Joab arose , and came to Absalom to his house , and said to him , " Why have your servants set my field on fire ? "
so Joab came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
it happened after this , that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses , and fifty men to run before him .
Absalom said moreover , " Oh that I were made judge in the land , that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me , and I would do him justice ! "
it was so , that when any man came near to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took hold of him , and kissed him .
Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment . so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
it happened at the end of forty years , that Absalom said to the king , " Please let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed to Yahweh , in Hebron .
two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem , who were invited , and went in their simplicity ; and they didn 't know anything .
Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David 's counselor , from his city , even from Giloh , while he was offering the sacrifices . the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Absalom .
a messenger came to David , saying , " The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom . "
the king 's servants said to the king , " behold , your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses . "
the king went forth , and all his household after him . the king left ten women , who were concubines , to keep the house .
the king went forth , and all the people after him ; and they stayed in Beth Merhak .
David said to Ittai , " Go and pass over . " Ittai the Gittite passed over , and all his men , and all the little ones who were with him .
the king said to Zadok , " Carry back the Ark of God into the city . if I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh , he will bring me again , and show me both it , and his habitation ;
but if he say thus , ' I have no delight in you ; ' behold , here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to him . "
behold , I will stay at the fords of the wilderness , until word comes from you to inform me . "
it happened that when David had come to the top , where God was worshiped , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn , and earth on his head .
Don 't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you ? therefore it shall be , that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king 's house , you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz , Zadok 's son , and Jonathan , Abiathar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
then the king said to Ziba , " behold , all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours . " Ziba said , " I do obeisance . let me find favor in your sight , my lord , O king . "
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
it may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me , and that Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today . "
so David and his men went by the way ; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him , and Cursed as he went , threw stones at him , and threw dust .
the king , and all the people who were with him , came weary ; and he refreshed himself there .
it happened , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , had come to Absalom , that Hushai said to Absalom , " Long live the king ! long live the king ! "
Hushai said to Absalom , " No ; but whomever Yahweh , and this people , and all the men of Israel have chosen , his will I be , and with him I will stay .
again , whom should I serve ? Shouldn 't I serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in your father 's presence , so will I be in your presence . "
so they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house ; and Absalom went in to his father 's concubines in the sight of all Israel .
I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted , and will make him afraid . all the people who are with him shall flee . I will strike the king only ;
and I will bring back all the people to you . the man whom you seek is as if all returned . all the people shall be in peace . "
even he who is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will utterly melt ; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man , and those who are with him are valiant men .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there isn 't one small stone found there . "
the woman took and spread the covering over the well 's mouth , and spread out bruised grain on it ; and nothing was known .
then David came to Mahanaim . Absalom passed over the Jordan , he and all the men of Israel with him .
Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab . now Amasa was the son of a man , whose name was Ithra the Israelite , who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah , Joab 's mother .
David numbered the people who were with him , and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them .
the king said to them , " I will do what seems best to you . " the king stood beside the gate , and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands .
the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , " Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom . " all the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom .
so the people went out into the field against Israel : and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim .
the people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David , and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men .
for the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country ; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured .
otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life ( and there is no matter hidden from the king ) , then you yourself would have set yourself against me . "
they took Absalom , and cast him into the great pit in the forest , and raised over him a very great heap of stones . then all Israel fled everyone to his tent .
then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said , " Let me now run , and bear the king news , how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies . "
" but come what may , " he said , " I will run . " he said to him , " Run ! " then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain , and outran the Cushite .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
the watchman cried , and told the king . the king said , " If he is alone , there is news in his mouth . " he came closer and closer .
the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people ; for the people heard it said that day , " The king grieves for his son . "
the people sneaked into the city that day , as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle .
Absalom , whom we anointed over us , is dead in battle . now therefore why don 't you speak a word of bringing the king back ? "
you are my brothers , you are my bone and my flesh . why then are you the last to bring back the king ? '
he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Return , you and all your servants . "
so the king returned , and came to the Jordan . Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to bring the king over the Jordan .
Shimei the son of Gera , the Benjamite , who was of Bahurim , hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David .
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
for your servant knows that I have sinned . therefore behold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king . "
but Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered , " shall Shimei not be put to death for this , because he Cursed Yahweh 's anointed ? "
the king said to Shimei , " You shall not die . " the king swore to him .
it happened , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Why didn 't you go with me , Mephibosheth ? "
he has slandered your servant to my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of God . do therefore what is good in your eyes .
Mephibosheth said to the king , " Yes , let him take all , because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house . "
Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim ; and he went over the Jordan with the king , to conduct him over the Jordan .
now Barzillai was a very aged man , even eighty years old : and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king . why should the king repay me with such a reward ?
all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . then the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned to his own place .
so the king went over to Gilgal , and Chimham went over with him . all the people of Judah brought the king over , and also half the people of Israel .
so all the men of Israel went up from following David , and followed Sheba the son of Bichri ; but the men of Judah joined with their king , from the Jordan even to Jerusalem .
so Amasa went to call the men of Judah together ; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men ; and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
there stood by him one of Joab 's young men , and said , " He who favors Joab , and he who is for David , let him follow Joab ! "
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Joab , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel , and to Beth Maacah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then a wise woman cried out of the city , " Hear , hear ! please say to Joab , ' Come near here , that I may speak with you . ' "
then she spoke , saying , " They were used to say in old times , ' They shall surely ask counsel at Abel ; ' and so they settled it .
now Joab was over all the army of Israel ; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites ;
and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder ;
but the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of Yahweh 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , the concubine of Saul , had done .
and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son : and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged .
they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela , in the tomb of Kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . after that God was entreated for the land .
the Philistines had war again with Israel ; and David went down , and his servants with him , and fought against the Philistines . David grew faint ;
it came to pass after this , that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph , who was of the sons of the giant .
there was again war with the Philistines at Gob ; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite 's brother , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
these four were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
and he said , " Yahweh is my rock , my fortress , and my deliverer , even mine ;
God , my rock , in him I will take refuge ; my shield , and the Horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge . my Savior , you save me from violence .
I will call on Yahweh , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from my enemies .
for the waves of death surrounded me . the floods of ungodliness made me afraid .
in my distress I called on Yahweh . yes , I called to my God . he heard my voice out of his temple . my cry came into his ears .
then the earth shook and trembled . the foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken , because he was angry .
smoke went up out of his nostrils . fire out of his mouth devoured . Coals were kindled by it .
he bowed the heavens also , and came down . thick darkness was under his feet .
he rode on a cherub , and flew . yes , he was seen on the wings of the wind .
he made darkness pavilions around himself : gathering of waters , and thick clouds of the skies .
at the brightness before him , coals of fire were kindled .
then the channels of the sea appeared . the foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh , At the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
he sent from on high and he took me . he drew me out of many waters .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , from those who hated me , for they were too mighty for me .
they came on me in the day of my calamity , but Yahweh was my support .
he also brought me out into a large place . he delivered me , because he delighted in me .
Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness . he rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands .
for I have kept the ways of Yahweh , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
for all his ordinances were before me . as for his statutes , I did not depart from them .
I was also perfect toward him . I kept myself from my iniquity .
therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness , According to my cleanness in his eyesight .
with the merciful you will show yourself merciful . with the perfect man you will show yourself perfect .
with the pure you will show yourself pure . with the crooked you will show yourself shrewd .
you will save the afflicted people , But your eyes are on the haughty , that you may bring them down .
for by you , I run against a troop . by my God , I leap over a wall .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yahweh is tested . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
he makes his feet like hinds ' feet , and sets me on my high places .
he teaches my hands to war , so that my arms bend a bow of brass .
you have also given me the shield of your salvation . your gentleness has made me great .
you have enlarged my steps under me . my feet have not slipped .
I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them . I didn 't turn again until they were consumed .
I have consumed them , and struck them through , so that they can 't arise . yes , they have fallen under my feet .
for you have armed me with strength for the battle . you have subdued under me those who rose up against me .
you have also made my enemies turn their backs to me , that I might cut off those who hate me .
they looked , but there was none to save ; even to Yahweh , but he didn 't answer them .
then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth . I crushed them as the mire of the streets , and spread them abroad .
you also have delivered me from the strivings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
the foreigners will submit themselves to me . as soon as they hear of me , they will obey me .
even the God who executes vengeance for me , who brings down peoples under me ,
who brings me away from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
therefore I will give thanks to you , Yahweh , among the nations . will sing praises to your name .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spoke to me , ' One who rules over men righteously , who rules in the fear of God ,
shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun rises , a morning without clouds , when the tender grass springs out of the earth , through clear shining after rain . '
but all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away , because they can 't be taken with the hand ,
but the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear . they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place . "
these are the names of the mighty men whom David had : Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite , chief of the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite , against eight hundred slain at one time .
after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite . the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of lentils ; and the people fled from the Philistines .
but he stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Philistines ; and Yahweh worked a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam ; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Wasn 't he most honorable of the three ? therefore he was made their captain : however he didn 't attain to the three .
Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite , Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin ,
Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai , the son of the Maacathite , Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite ,
Zelek the Ammonite , Naharai the Beerothite , armor bearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah ,
and came to the stronghold of Tyre , and to all the cities of the Hivites , and of the Canaanites ; and they went out to the south of Judah , at Beersheba .
so when they had gone back and forth through all the land , they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
David said to Gad , " I am in distress . let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh ; for his mercies are great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
so Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time ; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men .
Gad came that day to David , and said to him , " Go up , build an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite . "
Araunah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Araunah said to David , " Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . behold , the cattle for the burnt offering , and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood :
now king David was old and stricken in years ; and they covered him with clothes , but he couldn 't keep warm .
so they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel , and found Abishag the Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
the young lady was very beautiful ; and she cherished the king , and ministered to him ; but the king didn 't know her intimately .
then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , " I will be king . " then he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah , and with Abiathar the priest : and they following Adonijah helped him .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men who belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
now therefore come , please let me give you counsel , that you may save your own life , and the life of your son Solomon .
behold , while you yet talk there with the king , I also will come in after you , and confirm your words . "
Bathsheba went in to the king into the room . the king was very old ; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king .
she said to him , " My lord , you swore by Yahweh your God to your handmaid , ' Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne . '
now , behold , Adonijah reigns ; and you , my lord the king , don 't know it .
otherwise it will happen , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders . "
behold , while she yet talked with the king , Nathan the prophet came in .
they told the king , saying , " behold , Nathan the prophet ! " when he had come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Nathan said , " My lord , king , have you said , ' Adonijah shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ? '
but he hasn 't called me , even me your servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and your servant Solomon .
King David said , " Call to me Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada . " they came before the king .
the king said to them , " Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule , and bring him down to Gihon .
as Yahweh has been with my lord the king , even so may he be with Solomon , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David . "
Zadok the priest took the Horn of oil out of the tent , and anointed Solomon . they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , " Long live king Solomon ! "
all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth shook with their sound .
Jonathan answered Adonijah , " Most certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king .
Adonijah feared because of Solomon ; and he arose , and went , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
now the days of David drew near that he should die ; and he commanded Solomon his son , saying ,
" I am going the way of all the earth . you be strong therefore , and show yourself a man ;
but show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be of those who eat at your table ; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother .
the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years ; he reigned seven years in Hebron , and he reigned thirty @-@ three years in Jerusalem .
Solomon sat on the throne of David his father ; and his kingdom was firmly established .
then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon . she said , " Do you come peaceably ? " he said , " Peaceably .
he said , " Please speak to Solomon the king ( for he will not tell you ' no ' ) , that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife . "
so Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh , that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh , which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
the news came to Joab ; for Joab had turned after Adonijah , though he didn 't turn after Absalom . Joab fled to the tent of Yahweh , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up , and fell on him , and killed him ; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army ; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar .
for on the day you go out , and pass over the Brook Kidron , know for certain that you shall surely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
Shimei arose , and saddled his donkey , and went to Gath to Achish , to seek his servants ; and Shimei went , and brought his servants from Gath .
it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath , and had come again .
why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh , and the commandment that I have instructed you with ? "
the king said moreover to Shimei , " You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to , that you did to David my father . therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head .
so the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he went out , and fell on him , so that he died . the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon .
the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place . Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar .
now , Yahweh my God , you have made your servant king instead of David my father . I am but a little child . I don 't know how to go out or come in .
your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen , a great people , that can 't be numbered nor counted for multitude .
the speech pleased the Lord , that Solomon had asked this thing .
I have also given you that which you have not asked , both riches and honor , so that there shall not be any among the kings like you , all your days .
if you will walk in my ways , to keep my statutes and my commandments , as your father David walked , then I will lengthen your days . "
then two women who were prostitutes came to the king , and stood before him .
she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while your handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
when I rose in the morning to nurse my child , behold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , whom I bore . "
these were the princes whom he had : Azariah the son of Zadok , the priest ;
and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers ; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister , the king 's friend ;
and Ahishar was over the household ; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor .
Ben Hesed , in Arubboth ( to him belonged Socoh , and all the land of Hepher ) ;
Ben Abinadab , in all the height of Dor ( he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife ) ;
Baana the son of Ahilud , in Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan , beneath Jezreel , from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah , as far as beyond Jokmeam ;
Ahimaaz , in Naphtali ( he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife ) ;
Geber the son of Uri , in the land of Gilead , the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking and making merry .
Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines , and to the border of Egypt : they brought tribute , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
ten head of fat cattle , and twenty head of cattle out of the pastures , and one hundred sheep , besides harts , and gazelles , and roebucks , and fattened fowl .
for he had dominion over all on this side the River , from Tiphsah even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side the River : and he had peace on all sides around him .
those officers provided food for king Solomon , and for all who came to king Solomon 's table , every man in his month ; they let nothing be lacking .
barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where the officers were , every man according to his duty .
God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much , and very great understanding , even as the sand that is on the seashore .
Solomon 's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east , and all the wisdom of Egypt .
for he was wiser than all men ; than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , and Calcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol : and his fame was in all the nations all around .
Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon ; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father : for Hiram was ever a lover of David .
it happened , when Hiram heard the words of Solomon , that he rejoiced greatly , and said , " blessed is Yahweh this day , who has given to David a wise son over this great people . "
so Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire .
Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of pure oil . Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year .
Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom , as he promised him ; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon ; and they two made a treaty together .
King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel ; and the levy was thirty thousand men .
he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses ; a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home ; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor .
besides Solomon 's chief officers who were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , who bore rule over the people who labored in the work .
Solomon 's builders and Hiram 's builders and the Gebalites cut them , and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house .
the house which king Solomon built for Yahweh , its length was sixty cubits , and its breadth twenty , and its height thirty cubits .
the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubits was its length , according to the breadth of the house . ten cubits was its breadth before the house .
against the wall of the house he built stories all around , against the walls of the house all around , both of the temple and of the oracle ; and he made side rooms all around .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quarry ; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house : and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story , and out of the middle into the third .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar .
I will dwell among the children of Israel , and will not forsake my people Israel . "
there was cedar on the house within , carved with buds and open flowers : all was cedar ; there was no stone seen .
he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within , to set there the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh .
within the oracle was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in its height ; and he overlaid it with pure gold : and he covered the altar with cedar .
so Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold : and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle ; and he overlaid it with gold .
the whole house he overlaid with gold , until all the house was finished : also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold .
five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
the height of the one cherub was ten cubits , and so was it of the other cherub .
he carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers , inside and outside .
for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood : the lintel and door posts were a fifth part of the wall .
and two doors of fir wood : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid , in the month Ziv .
it was covered with cedar above over the forty @-@ five beams , that were on the pillars ; fifteen in a row .
there were beams in three rows , and window was over against window in three ranks .
he made the porch of pillars ; its length was fifty cubits , and its breadth thirty cubits ; and a porch before them ; and pillars and a threshold before them .
he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge , even the porch of judgment : and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor .
his house where he was to dwell , the other court within the porch , was of the like work . he made also a house for Pharaoh 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this porch .
the foundation was of costly stones , even great stones , stones of ten cubits , and stones of eight cubits .
the great court around had three courses of cut stone , and a course of cedar beams ; like as the inner court of the house of Yahweh , and the porch of the house .
for he fashioned the two pillars of brass , Eighteen cubits high apiece : and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them about .
the capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of Lily work , four cubits .
there were capitals above also on the two pillars , close by the belly which was beside the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred , in rows around on the other capital .
he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called its name Jachin ; and he set up the left pillar , and called its name Boaz .
on the top of the pillars was Lily work : so was the work of the pillars finished .
he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it .
under its brim around there were buds which encircled it , for ten cubits , encircling the sea : the buds were in two rows , cast when it was cast .
it was a handbreadth thick : and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup , like the flower of a Lily : it held two thousand baths .
he made the ten bases of brass ; four cubits was the length of one base , and four cubits its breadth , and three cubits its height .
the work of the bases was like this : they had panels ; and there were panels between the ledges ;
and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubim ; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above ; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work .
the four wheels were underneath the panels ; and the axles of the wheels were in the base : and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit .
the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their axles , and their rims , and their spokes , and their naves , were all molten .
there were four supports at the four corners of each base : its supports were of the base itself .
in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high ; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same .
on the plates of its stays , and on its panels , he engraved cherubim , lions , and palm trees , according to the space of each , with wreaths all around .
in this way , he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one form .
he made ten basins of brass : one basin contained forty baths ; and every basin was four cubits ; and on every one of the ten bases one basin .
Hiram made the basins , and the shovels , and the basins . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh :
the two pillars , and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ;
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars ;
and the ten bases , and the ten basins on the bases ;
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basins : even all these vessels , which Hiram made for king Solomon , in the house of Yahweh , were of burnished brass .
the king cast them in the plain of the Jordan , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan .
Solomon left all the vessels unweighed , because they were exceeding many : the weight of the brass could not be found out .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh : the golden altar , and the table whereupon the show bread was , of gold ;
all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast , in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , who were assembled to him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark , and the cherubim covered the Ark and its poles above .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there they are to this day .
it came to pass , when the priests had come out of the holy place , that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh ,
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud ; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh .
the king turned his face about , and blessed all the assembly of Israel : and all the assembly of Israel stood .
he said , " blessed is Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David your father , and has with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
" now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
but Yahweh said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart .
nevertheless , you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
there I have set a place for the Ark , in which is the Covenant of Yahweh , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ;
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
" now therefore , God of Israel , please let your word be verified , which you spoke to your servant David my father .
but will God in very deed dwell on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain you ; how much less this house that I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and for his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day ;
listen to the supplication of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place . yes , hear in heaven , your dwelling place ; and when you hear , forgive .
" if a man sins against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swear before your altar in this house ;
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers .
whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall each know the plague of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers .
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
( for they shall hear of your great name , and of your mighty hand , and of your outstretched arm ) ; when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
( for they are your people , and your inheritance , which you brought out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron ) ;
that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant , and to the supplication of your people Israel , to listen to them whenever they cry to you .
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh , he arose from before the altar of Yahweh , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven .
he stood , and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice , saying ,
May Yahweh our God be with us , as he was with our fathers . let him not leave us , nor forsake us ;
that he may incline our hearts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his ordinances , which he commanded our fathers .
" let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day . "
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
that Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time , as he had appeared to him at Gibeon .
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel . '
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Yahweh and the king 's house
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they didn 't please him .
Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
as for all the people who were left of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
these were the chief officers who were over Solomon 's work , five hundred fifty , who bore rule over the people who labored in the work .
but Pharaoh 's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her : then he built Millo .
King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .
Hiram sent in the navy his servants , sailors who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
they came to Ophir , and fetched from there gold , four hundred and twenty talents , and brought it to king Solomon .
when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Yahweh , she came to prove him with hard questions .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
however I didn 't believe the words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it . behold , the half was not told me ! your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard .
the navy also of Hiram , that brought gold from Ophir , brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty @-@ six talents of gold ,
besides that which the traders brought , and the traffic of the merchants , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the governors of the country .
moreover the king made a great throne of Ivory , and overlaid it with the finest gold .
there were six steps to the throne , and the top of the throne was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any kingdom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
all the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt ; and the king 's merchants received them in droves , each drove at a price .
now king Solomon loved many foreign women , together with the daughter of Pharaoh , women of the Moabites , Ammonites , Edomites , Sidonians , and Hittites ;
for Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians , and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites .
Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and didn 't go fully after Yahweh , as did David his father .
then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab , on the mountain that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon .
notwithstanding I will not do it in your days , for David your father 's sake ; but I will tear it out of the hand of your son .
however I will not tear away all the kingdom ; but I will give one tribe to your son , for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen . "
Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon , Hadad the Edomite : he was of the king 's seed in Edom .
for it happened , when David was in Edom , and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain , and had struck every male in Edom
( for Joab and all Israel remained there six months , until he had cut off every male in Edom ) ;
that Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt , Hadad being yet a little child .
Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh 's house ; and Genubath was in Pharaoh 's house among the sons of Pharaoh .
God raised up an adversary to him , Rezon the son of Eliada , who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah .
he gathered men to him , and became captain over a troop , when David killed them of Zobah : and they went to Damascus , and lived therein , and reigned in Damascus .
he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon , besides the mischief of Hadad : and he abhorred Israel , and reigned over Syria .
Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephraimite of Zeredah , a servant of Solomon , whose mother 's name was Zeruah , a widow , he also lifted up his hand against the king .
this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Millo , and repaired the breach of the city of David his father .
it happened at that time , when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him , and tore it in twelve pieces .
( but he shall have one tribe , for my servant David 's sake and for Jerusalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel ) ;
but I will take the kingdom out of his son 's hand , and will give it to you , even ten tribes .
to his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
I will take you , and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires , and shall be king over Israel .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam ; but Jeroboam arose , and fled into Egypt , to Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , aren 't they written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
Solomon slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David his father : and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place .
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam lived in Egypt ,
and they sent and called him ) , that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came , and spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with Scorpions . ' "
but as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
" speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and to the rest of the people , saying ,
then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and lived in it ; and he went out from there , and built Penuel .
this thing became a sin ; for the people went to worship before the one , even to Dan .
he made houses of high places , and made priests from among all the people , who were not of the sons of Levi .
behold , there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth El : and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense .
the man of God said to the king , " Even if you gave me half of your house , I would not go in with you , neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place ;
for so was it commanded me by the word of Yahweh , saying , ' You shall eat no bread , nor drink water , neither return by the way that you came . ' "
he said to his sons , " Saddle the donkey for me . " so they saddled the donkey for him ; and he rode on it .
he said , " I may not return with you , nor go in with you ; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place .
it happened , as they sat at the table , that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back ;
it happened , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the donkey stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
behold , men passed by , and saw the body cast in the way , and the lion standing by the body ; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived .
the prophet took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the donkey , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn , and to bury him .
he laid his body in his own grave ; and they mourned over him , saying , " Alas , my brother ! "
this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth .
take with you ten loaves , and cakes , and a jar of honey , and go to him . he will tell you what will become of the child . "
he who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Yahweh has spoken it . " '
he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , which he has sinned , and with which he has made Israel to sin . "
Jeroboam 's wife arose , and departed , and came to Tirzah . as she came to the threshold of the house , the child died .
all Israel buried him , and mourned for him , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet .
the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years : and he slept with his fathers , and Nadab his son reigned in his place .
Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed , above all that their fathers had done .
and there were also sodomites in the land : they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel .
it happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem ;
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king went into the house of Yahweh , the guard bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and his mother 's name was Naamah the Ammonitess . Abijam his son reigned in his place .
he reigned three years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom .
he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him ; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God , as the heart of David his father .
nevertheless for David 's sake , Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem ;
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and didn 't turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
Abijam slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in the city of David : and ASA his son reigned in his place .
he reigned forty @-@ one years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom .
ASA did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , as did David his father .
also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen , because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah ; and ASA cut down her image , and burnt it at the Brook Kidron .
but the high places were not taken away : nevertheless the heart of ASA was perfect with Yahweh all his days .
he brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to ASA king of Judah .
Ben Hadad listened to king ASA , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck Ijon , and Dan , and Abel Beth Maacah , and all Chinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and lived in Tirzah .
Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of ASA king of Judah ; and he reigned over Israel two years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
even in the third year of ASA king of Judah , Baasha killed him , and reigned in his place .
for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger .
now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the third year of ASA king of Judah , Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah for twenty @-@ four years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
behold , I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house ; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
the dogs will eat Baasha 's descendants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Baasha slept with his fathers , and was buried in Tirzah ; and Elah his son reigned in his place .
in the twenty @-@ sixth year of ASA king of Judah , Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah for two years .
his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him . now he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , who was over the household in Tirzah :
and Zimri went in and struck him , and killed him , in the twenty @-@ seventh year of ASA king of Judah , and reigned in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Elah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the twenty @-@ seventh year of ASA king of Judah , Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah . now the people were encamped against Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines .
Omri went up from Gibbethon , and all Israel with him , and they besieged Tirzah .
for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his treason that he committed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
but the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath : so Tibni died , and Omri reigned .
Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and dealt wickedly above all who were before him .
now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he showed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
so Omri slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria ; and Ahab his son reigned in his place .
he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal , which he had built in Samaria .
Ahab made the Asherah ; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
" go away from here , turn eastward , and hide yourself by the Brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
it shall be , that you shall drink of the Brook . I have commanded the ravens to feed you there . "
so he went and did according to the word of Yahweh ; for he went and lived by the Brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drank of the Brook .
it happened after a while , that the Brook dried up , because there was no rain in the land .
as she was going to get it , he called to her , and said , " Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand . "
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' The jar of meal shall not empty , neither shall the jar of oil fail , until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth . ' "
she went and did according to the saying of Elijah : and she , and he , and her house , ate many days .
the jar of meal didn 't empty , neither did the jar of oil fail , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by Elijah .
he cried to Yahweh , and said , " Yahweh my God , have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I stay , by killing her son ? "
he stretched himself on the child three times , and cried to Yahweh , and said , " Yahweh my God , please let this child 's soul come into him again . "
Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Elijah said , " behold , your son lives . "
it happened after many days , that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah , in the third year , saying , " Go , show yourself to Ahab ; and I will send rain on the earth . "
Ahab called Obadiah , who was over the household . ( now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly :
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh , that Obadiah took one hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it : Ahab went one way by himself , and Obadiah went another way by himself .
now you say , ' Go , tell your lord , " behold , Elijah is here " ; ' and he will kill me . "
so Ahab sent to all the children of Israel , and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel .
then Elijah said to the people , " I , even I only , am left a prophet of Yahweh ; but Baal 's prophets are four hundred fifty men .
it was so , when midday was past , that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , to whom the word of Yahweh came , saying , " Israel shall be your name . "
with the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh . he made a trench around the altar , large enough to contain two measures of seed .
hear me , Yahweh , hear me , that this people may know that you , Yahweh , are God , and that you have turned their heart back again . "
then the fire of Yahweh fell , and consumed the burnt offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces . they said , " Yahweh , he is God ! Yahweh , he is God ! "
Elijah said to them , " seize the prophets of Baal ! Don 't let one of them escape ! " they seized them . Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon , and killed them there .
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he bowed himself down on the earth , and put his face between his knees .
it happened in a little while , that the sky grew black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . Ahab rode , and went to Jezreel .
the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah ; and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel .
Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done , and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword .
he looked , and behold , there was at his head a cake baked on the coals , and a jar of water . he ate and drank , and lay down again .
the angel of Yahweh came again the second time , and touched him , and said , " arise and eat , because the journey is too great for you . "
he arose , and ate and drank , and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the Mount of God .
it shall happen , that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael , Jehu will kill ; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu , Elisha will kill .
yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel , all the knees which have not bowed to Baal , and every mouth which has not kissed him . "
he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel , into the city , and said to him , " Thus says Ben Hadad ,
the messengers came again , and said , " Ben Hadad says , ' I sent indeed to you , saying , " You shall deliver me your silver , and your gold , and your wives , and your children ;
then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty @-@ two . after them , he mustered all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
they went out at noon . but Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions , he and the kings , the thirty @-@ two kings who helped him .
the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first ; and Ben Hadad sent out , and they told him , saying , " Men are coming out from Samaria . "
so these went out of the city , the young men of the princes of the provinces , and the army which followed them .
the king of Israel went out , and struck the horses and chariots , and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter .
do this thing : take the kings away , every man out of his place , and put captains in their place .
it happened at the return of the year , that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh , " Please strike me ! " the man refused to strike him .
so the prophet departed , and waited for the king by the way , and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes .
as your servant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " So your judgment shall be ; you yourself have decided it . "
he hurried , and took the headband away from his eyes ; and the king of Israel recognized that he was of the prophets .
the king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry , and came to Samaria .
but Jezebel his wife came to him , and said to him , " Why is your spirit so sad , that you eat no bread ? "
Jezebel his wife said to him , " Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel ? arise , and eat bread , and let your heart be merry . I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite . "
the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city , did as Jezebel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
they proclaimed a fast , and set Naboth on high among the people .
it happened , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
" arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who dwells in Samaria . behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
the dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city ; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field . "
but there was none like Ahab , who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , whom Jezebel his wife stirred up .
he did very abominably in following idols , according to all that the Amorites did , whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
it happened , when Ahab heard those words , that he tore his clothes , and put sackcloth on his flesh , and fasted , and lay in sackcloth , and went softly .
it happened in the third year , that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel .
Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , " Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh . "
Micaiah said , " Therefore hear the word of Yahweh . I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne , and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left .
a spirit came out and stood before Yahweh , and said , ' I will entice him . '
now therefore , behold , Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets ; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you . "
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you ? "
Micaiah said , " behold , you will see on that day , when you go into an inner room to hide yourself . "
the king of Israel said , " Take Micaiah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son .
say , ' Thus says the king , " Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace . " ' "
now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty @-@ two captains of his chariots , saying , Fight neither with small nor great , except only with the king of Israel .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun , saying , " Every man to his city , and every man to his country ! "
so the king died , and was brought to Samaria ; and they buried the king in Samaria .
they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves ; according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke .
so Ahab slept with his fathers ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place .
Jehoshaphat the son of ASA began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel .
Jehoshaphat was thirty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ five years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he showed , and how he warred , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
the remnant of the sodomites , that remained in the days of his father ASA , he put away out of the land .
Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold : but they didn 't go ; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber .
Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father ; Jehoram his son reigned in his place .
Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and he reigned two years over Israel .
he served Baal , and worshiped him , and provoked to anger Yahweh , the God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
he said to them , " What kind of man was he who came up to meet you , and told you these words ? "
behold , fire came down from the sky , and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties . but now let my life be precious in your sight . "
the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah , " Go down with him . Don 't be afraid of him . " he arose , and went down with him to the king .
so he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken . Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah ; because he had no son .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
it happened , when Yahweh would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven , that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal .
Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and struck the waters , and they were divided here and there , so that they two went over on dry ground .
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that behold , a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
they came back to him , while he stayed at Jericho ; and he said to them , " Didn 't I tell you , ' Don 't go ? ' "
so the waters were healed to this day , according to the word of Elisha which he spoke .
he looked behind him and saw them , and Cursed them in the name of Yahweh . two female bears came out of the woods , and mauled forty @-@ two of those youths .
now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and reigned twelve years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , but not like his father , and like his mother ; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made .
nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder ; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs , and of one hundred thousand rams .
but it happened , when Ahab was dead , that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
for thus says Yahweh , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your livestock and your animals .
this is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh . he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand .
now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , they gathered themselves together , all who were able to put on armor , and upward , and stood on the border .
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone on the water , and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood .
when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites , so that they fled before them ; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites .
when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword , to break through to the king of Edom ; but they could not .
then he said , " Go , borrow containers from of all your neighbors , even empty containers . Don 't borrow just a few .
you shall go in , and shut the door on you and on your sons , and pour out into all those containers ; and you shall set aside that which is full . "
so she went from him , and shut the door on her and on her sons ; they brought the containers to her , and she poured out .
the woman conceived , and bore a son at that season , when the time came around , as Elisha had said to her .
when the child was grown , it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers .
when he had taken him , and brought him to his mother , he sat on her knees until noon , and then died .
she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God , and shut the door on him , and went out .
then she saddled a donkey , and said to her servant , " Drive , and go forward ! Don 't slow down for me , unless I ask you to . "
when Elisha had come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid on his bed .
he went in therefore , and shut the door on them both , and prayed to Yahweh .
then he returned , and walked in the house once back and forth ; and went up , and stretched himself on him . then the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
he called Gehazi , and said , " Call this Shunammite ! " so he called her . when she had come in to him , he said , " Take up your son . "
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
the Syrians had gone out in bands , and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden ; and she waited on Naaman 's wife .
someone went in , and told his lord , saying , " The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this . "
he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , " Now when this letter has come to you , behold , I have sent Naaman my servant to you , that you may heal him of his leprosy . "
so Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots , and stood at the door of the house of Elisha .
Elisha sent a messenger to him , saying , " Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and your flesh shall come again to you , and you shall be clean . "
Aren 't Abanah and Pharpar , the rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? Couldn 't I wash in them , and be clean ? " so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they departed .
the sons of the prophets said to Elisha , " See now , the place where we dwell before you is too small for us .
please let us go to the Jordan , and every man take a beam from there , and let us make us a place there , where we may dwell . " he answered , " Go ! "
but as one was felling a beam , the axe head fell into the water . then he cried , and said , " Alas , my master ! for it was borrowed . "
now the king of Syria was warring against Israel ; and he took counsel with his servants , saying , " My camp will be in such and such a place . "
the man of God sent to the king of Israel , saying , " beware that you not pass such a place ; for the Syrians are coming down there . "
the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of ; and he saved himself there , not once nor twice .
one of his servants said , " No , my lord , O king ; but Elisha , the prophet who is in Israel , tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom . "
therefore he sent horses , chariots , and a great army there . they came by night , and surrounded the city .
he answered , " Don 't be afraid ; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them . "
the king of Israel said to Elisha , when he saw them , " My father , shall I strike them ? shall I strike them ? "
there was a great famine in Samaria . behold , they besieged it , until a donkey 's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a kab of dove 's Dung for five pieces of silver .
as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall , a woman cried to him , saying , " Help , my lord , O king ! "
then he said , " God do so to me , and more also , if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stay on him this day . "
they rose up in the twilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
therefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their donkeys , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
he called the porters ; and they told it to the king 's household within .
they went after them to the Jordan ; and behold , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . the messengers returned , and told the king .
it happened like that to him ; for the people trod on him in the gate , and he died .
the woman arose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years .
now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God , saying , " Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done . "
the king said to Hazael , " Take a present in your hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inquire of Yahweh by him , saying , ' Will I recover from this sickness ? ' "
in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
he was thirty @-@ two years old when he began to reign . he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife . he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
however Yahweh would not destroy Judah , for David his servant 's sake , as he promised him to give to him a lamp for his children always .
in his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah , and made a king over themselves .
then Joram passed over to Zair , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , and the captains of the chariots ; and the people fled to their tents .
so Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day . then Libnah revolted at the same time .
the rest of the acts of Joram , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Joram slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place .
in the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign .
twenty @-@ two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets , and said to him , " Put your belt on your waist , take this vial of oil in your hand , and go to Ramoth Gilead .
when you come there , find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brothers , and carry him to an inner room .
so the young man , even the young man the prophet , went to Ramoth Gilead .
you shall strike the house of Ahab your master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh , at the hand of Jezebel .
for the whole house of Ahab shall perish . I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall , both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah .
the dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel , and there shall be none to bury her . ' " he opened the door , and fled .
then they hurried , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew the trumpet , saying , " Jehu is king . "
so Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram . ( now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead , he and all Israel , because of Hazael king of Syria ;
the watchman said , " He came to them , and isn 't coming back . the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi ; for he drives furiously . "
Jehu drew his bow with his full strength , and struck Joram between his arms ; and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
when Jehu had come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her eyes , and attired her head , and looked out at the window .
he lifted up his face to the window , and said , " Who is on my side ? who ? " two or three eunuchs looked out at him .
he said , " throw her down ! " so they threw her down ; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses . then he trampled her under foot .
when he had come in , he ate and drink ; and he said , " See now to this Cursed woman , and bury her ; for she is a king 's daughter . "
they went to bury her ; but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of her hands .
and the body of Jezebel shall be as Dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel , so that they shall not say , " This is Jezebel . " ' "
now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , to the rulers of Jezreel , even the elders , and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab , saying ,
" now as soon as this letter comes to you , since your master 's sons are with you , and there are with you chariots and horses , a fortified city also , and armor .
select the best and fittest of your master 's sons , set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house . "
but they were exceedingly afraid , and said , " behold , the two kings didn 't stand before him ! how then shall we stand ? "
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent them to him to Jezreel .
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righteous . behold , I conspired against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of Yahweh , which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab . for Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah . "
so Jehu struck all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , with all his great men , his familiar friends , and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
he arose and departed , and went to Samaria . as he was at the Shearing house of the shepherds on the way ,
when he came to Samaria , he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke to Elijah .
they brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal , and burned them .
they broke down the pillar of Baal , and broke down the house of Baal , and made it a latrine , to this day .
however from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin , Jehu didn 't depart from after them , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
now the rest of the acts of Jehu , and all that he did , and all his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Jehu slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in Samaria . Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place .
now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal .
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the two companies of you , even all who go out on the Sabbath , shall keep the watch of the house of Yahweh around the king .
you shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he who comes within the ranks , let him be slain . be with the king when he goes out , and when he comes in . "
the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David 's , which were in the house of Yahweh .
when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the house of Yahweh :
so they made way for her ; and she went by the way of the horses ' entry to the king 's house . she was slain there .
so all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was quiet . Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king 's house .
let the priests take it to them , every man from his acquaintance ; and they shall repair the breaches of the house , wherever any breach shall be found . "
but it was so , that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
the priests consented that they should take no more money from the people , neither repair the breaches of the house .
but there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups of silver , snuffers , basins , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh ;
for they gave that to those who did the work , and repaired therewith the house of Yahweh .
moreover they didn 't demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work ; for they dealt faithfully .
the money for the trespass offerings , and the money for the sin offerings , was not brought into the house of Yahweh : it was the priests ' .
then Hazael king of Syria went up , and fought against Gath , and took it ; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem .
now the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
his servants arose , and made a conspiracy , and struck Joash at the house of Millo , on the way that goes down to Silla .
in the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah , king of Judah , Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael , continually .
nevertheless they didn 't depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked therein : and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria . )
for he didn 't leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the dust in threshing .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Jehoahaz slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in Samaria : and Joash his son reigned in his place .
in the thirty @-@ seventh year of Joash king of Judah , Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria for sixteen years .
Joash slept with his fathers ; and Jeroboam sat on his throne : and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel .
he said to the king of Israel , " Put your hand on the bow " ; and he put his hand on it . Elisha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
Elisha died , and they buried him . now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
in the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , yet not like David his father : he did according to all that Joash his father had done .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father :
then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
but Amaziah would not listen . so Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
Judah was defeated by Israel ; and they fled every man to his tent .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
Jehoash slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel ; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish : but they sent after him to Lachish , and killed him there .
they brought him on horses ; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David .
all the people of Judah took Azariah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
in the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah , Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria for forty @-@ one years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
for Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter ; for there was none shut up nor left at large , neither was there any helper for Israel .
Yahweh didn 't say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky ; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash .
in the twenty @-@ seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that his father Amaziah had done .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of Azariah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Azariah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Jotham his son reigned in his place .
Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him , and struck him before the people , and killed him , and reigned in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Zechariah , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
this was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu , saying , " Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty @-@ ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah ; and he reigned for a month in Samaria .
Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah , and came to Samaria , and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria , and killed him , and reigned in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Shallum , and his conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
in the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah , Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel for ten years in Samaria .
there came against the land Pul the king of Assyria ; and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand .
now the rest of the acts of Menahem , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria for two years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
in the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria for twenty years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and struck him , and killed him , and reigned in his place , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
now the rest of the acts of Pekah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
in the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh ; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places . he built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Jotham slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Ahaz his son reigned in his place .
in the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign .
twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel .
then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war : and they besieged Ahaz , but could not overcome him .
at that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria , and drove the Jews from Elath ; and the Syrians came to Elath , and lived there , to this day .
Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
Urijah the priest built an altar : according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus , so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus .
when the king had come from Damascus , the king saw the altar : and the king drew near to the altar , and offered on it .
he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , on the altar .
the bronze altar , which was before Yahweh , he brought from the forefront of the house , from between his altar and the house of Yahweh , and put it on the north side of his altar .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Ahaz slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place .
in the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah , Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel for nine years .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him .
against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria ; and Hoshea became his servant , and brought him tribute .
then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land , and went up to Samaria , and besieged it three years .
in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away to Assyria , and placed them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and walked in the statutes of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they made .
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city ;
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them ; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger ;
notwithstanding , they would not listen , but hardened their neck , like the neck of their fathers , who didn 't believe in Yahweh their God .
they forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made an Asherah , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served Baal .
therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
also Judah didn 't keep the commandments of Yahweh their God , but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made .
Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he tore Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh , and made them sin a great sin .
the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did ; they didn 't depart from them ;
until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight , as he spoke by all his servants the prophets . so Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day .
so one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel , and taught them how they should fear Yahweh .
however every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities in which they lived .
the men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth , and the men of Cuth made Nergal , and the men of Hamath made Ashima ,
so they feared Yahweh , and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
they feared Yahweh , and served their own gods , after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away .
with whom Yahweh had made a Covenant , and commanded them , saying , " You shall not fear other gods , nor bow yourselves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them ;
the statutes and the ordinances , and the law and the commandment , which he wrote for you , you shall observe to do forevermore . you shall not fear other gods .
you shall not forget the Covenant that I have made with you ; neither shall you fear other gods .
but you shall fear Yahweh your God ; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies . "
so these nations feared Yahweh , and served their engraved images . their children likewise , and their children 's children , as their fathers did , so they do to this day .
now it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that David his father had done .
he trusted in Yahweh , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor among them that were before him .
for he joined with Yahweh ; he didn 't depart from following him , but kept his commandments , which Yahweh commanded Moses .
Yahweh was with him ; wherever he went forth he prospered : and he rebelled against the king of Assyria , and didn 't serve him .
he struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city .
it happened in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
at the end of three years they took it : in the sixth year of Hezekiah , which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria , and put them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ,
because they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh their God , but transgressed his Covenant , even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded , and would not hear it , nor do it .
now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah , and took them .
Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
at that time , Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh 's temple , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebnah the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
Rabshakeh said to them , " Say now to Hezekiah , ' Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria , " What confidence is this in which you trust ?
you say ( but they are but vain words ) , ' There is counsel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
have I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it ? Yahweh said to me , ' Go up against this land , and destroy it . ' " ' "
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria .
thus says the king , ' Don 't let Hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , came with Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of Yahweh .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will put a spirit in him , and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "
so Rabshakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah ; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish .
when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , " behold , he has come out to fight against you , he sent messengers again to Hezekiah , saying ,
'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , " Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
behold , you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands , by destroying them utterly . will you be delivered ?
have the gods of the nations delivered them , which my fathers have destroyed , Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden that were in Telassar ?
where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? " ' "
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it . then Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh , and spread it before Yahweh .
Incline your ear , Yahweh , and hear . open your eyes , Yahweh , and see . hear the words of Sennacherib , with which he has sent to defy the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dug and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt . '
haven 't you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
but I know your sitting down , and your going out , and your coming in , and your raging against me .
the remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
for out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out , and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape . the zeal of Yahweh will perform this . '
" therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria , ' He shall not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mound against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yahweh .
'For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
it happened that night , that the angel of Yahweh went out , and struck one hundred eighty @-@ five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
then he turned his face to the wall , and prayed to Yahweh , saying ,
it happened , before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city , that the word of Yahweh came to him , saying ,
Isaiah said , " This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh , that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or go back ten steps ? "
Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh ; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward , by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz .
at that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah ; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
he said , " What have they seen in your house ? " Hezekiah answered , " They have seen all that is in my house . there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them . "
'Of your sons who shall issue from you , whom you shall father , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon . ' "
then Hezekiah said to Isaiah , " The word of Yahweh which you have spoken is good . " he said moreover , " Isn 't it so , if peace and truth shall be in my days ? "
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hephzibah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
he built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh .
I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies . they will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which is evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
Manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza : and Amon his son reigned in his place .
Amon was twenty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as Manasseh his father did .
he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the idols that his father served , and worshiped them :
and he forsook Yahweh , the God of his fathers , and didn 't walk in the way of Yahweh .
the servants of Amon conspired against him , and put the king to death in his own house .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza : and Josiah his son reigned in his place .
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty @-@ one years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in all the way of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan , the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of Yahweh , saying ,
" go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh , which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
however there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand ; for they dealt faithfully . "
Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he tore his clothes .
the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Micaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read .
he broke down the houses of the sodomites , that were in the house of Yahweh , where the women wove hangings for the Asherah .
nevertheless the priests of the high places didn 't come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem , but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers .
he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
he broke in pieces the pillars , and cut down the Asherim , and filled their places with the bones of men .
he killed all the priests of the high places that were there , on the altars , and burned men 's bones on them ; and he returned to Jerusalem .
the king commanded all the people , saying , " keep the Passover to Yahweh your God , as it is written in this book of the Covenant . "
surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
notwithstanding , Yahweh didn 't turn from the fierceness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Jehoahaz was twenty @-@ three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his fathers had done .
Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father , and changed his name to Jehoiakim : but he took Jehoahaz away ; and he came to Egypt , and died there .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his fathers had done .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
the king of Egypt didn 't come again out of his land any more ; for the king of Babylon had taken , from the Brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates , all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
Jehoiachin was Eighteen years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months : and his mother 's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his father had done .
at that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem , and the city was besieged .
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city , while his servants were besieging it ;
the king of Babylon made Mattaniah , Jehoiachin 's father 's brother , king is his place , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of Yahweh , it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah ; and they gave judgment on him .
they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
he burnt the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burnt he with fire .
all the army of the Chaldeans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down the walls around Jerusalem .
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Babylon , and the residue of the multitude .
but the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields .
they took away the pots , the shovels , the snuffers , the spoons , and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered .
the captain of the guard took away the fire pans , the basins , that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
the two pillars , the one sea , and the bases , which Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh , the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the threshold :
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the forces , arose , and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans .
and he spoke kindly to him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon ,
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him of the king , every day a portion , all the days of his life .

their brothers , in their villages , were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them :

the battle went hard against Saul , and the archers overtook him ; and he was distressed by reason of the archers .
when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead , he likewise fell on his sword , and died .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook their cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they stripped him , and took his head , and his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to their idols , and to the people .
then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron , saying , " behold , we are your bone and your flesh .
so all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron ; and David made a Covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh ; and they anointed David king over Israel , according to the word of Yahweh by Samuel .
David and all Israel went to Jerusalem ( the same is Jebus ) ; and the Jebusites , the inhabitants of the land , were there .

he was with David at Pasdammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines .
they stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Philistines ; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more honorable than the two , and was made their captain : however he didn 't attain to the three .

these of the sons of Gad were captains of the army : he who was least was equal to one hundred , and the greatest to one thousand .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had overflowed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
they helped David against the band of rovers : for they were all mighty men of valor , and were captains in the army .
the children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred , armed for war .
of the children of Simeon , mighty men of valor for the war , seven thousand and one hundred .
of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred .
Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron ; and with him were three thousand and seven hundred ,

they were there with David three days , eating and drinking ; for their brothers had made preparation for them .
David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds , even with every leader .
and let us bring again the Ark of our God to us . for we didn 't seek it in the days of Saul . "
all the assembly said that they would do so ; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
so David assembled all Israel together , from the Shihor the Brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath , to bring the Ark of God from Kiriath Jearim .
they carried the Ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart .
David and all Israel played before God with all their might , even with songs , and with harps , and with stringed instruments , and with tambourines , and with cymbals , and with trumpets .
when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon , Uzza put forth his hand to hold the Ark ; for the oxen stumbled .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza , and he struck him , because he put forth his hand to the Ark ; and there he died before God .
David was displeased , because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzza ; and he called that place Perez Uzza , to this day .
so David didn 't move the Ark to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David , and cedar trees , and masons , and carpenters , to build him a house .
David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel ; for his kingdom was exalted on high , for his people Israel 's sake .
these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon ,
when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David : and David heard of it , and went out against them .
now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim .
David inquired of God , saying , " shall I go up against the Philistines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? " Yahweh said to him , " Go up ; for I will deliver them into your hand . "
they left their gods there ; and David gave commandment , and they were burned with fire .
David inquired again of God ; and God said to him , " You shall not go up after them . turn away from them , and come on them over against the mulberry trees .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
David did as God commanded him : and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer .
David made him houses in the city of David ; and he prepared a place for the Ark of God , and pitched for it a tent .
then David said , " No one ought to carry the Ark of God but the Levites . for Yahweh has chosen them to carry the Ark of God , and to minister to him forever . "
David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of Yahweh to its place , which he had prepared for it .
of the sons of Kohath , Uriel the chief , and his brothers one hundred twenty ;
of the sons of Merari , Asaiah the chief , and his brothers two hundred twenty ;
of the sons of Gershom , Joel the chief , and his brothers one hundred thirty ;
of the sons of Elizaphan , Shemaiah the chief , and his brothers two hundred ;
of the sons of Hebron , Eliel the chief , and his brothers eighty ;
of the sons of Uzziel , Amminadab the chief , and his brothers one hundred twelve .
David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests , and for the Levites , for Uriel , Asaiah , and Joel , Shemaiah , and Eliel , and Amminadab ,
for because you didn 't carry it at first , Yahweh our God made broke out against us , because we didn 't seek him according to the ordinance . "
so the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
the children of the Levites bore the Ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh .
David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers , with instruments of music , stringed instruments and harps and cymbals , sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy .
so the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brothers , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brothers , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
so the singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud ;
and Mattithiah , and Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps tuned to the eight @-@ stringed Lyre , to lead .
Shebaniah , and Joshaphat , and Nethanel , and Amasai , and Zechariah , and Benaiah , and Eliezer , the priests , blew the trumpets before the Ark of God : and Obed @-@ Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the Ark .
so David , and the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed @-@ Edom with joy .
it happened , when God helped the Levites who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams .
they brought in the Ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God .
when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh .
he dealt to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a portion of meat , and a cake of raisins .
he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the Ark of Yahweh , and to celebrate and to thank and praise Yahweh , the God of Israel :
and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually , before the Ark of the Covenant of God .
then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh , by the hand of Asaph and his brothers .
Oh give thanks to Yahweh . call on his name . make his doings known among the peoples .
sing to him . sing praises to him . tell of all his marvelous works .
glory in his holy name . let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice .
he confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute , and to Israel for an everlasting Covenant ,
when you were but a few men in number , yes , very few , and foreigners were in it .
declare his glory among the nations , and his marvelous works among all the peoples .
for great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised . he also is to be feared above all gods .
Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name . bring an offering , and come before him . worship Yahweh in holy array .
let the sea roar , and its fullness ! let the field exult , and all that is therein !
then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh , for he comes to judge the earth .
say , " Save us , God of our salvation ! gather us together and deliver us from the nations , to give thanks to your holy name , to triumph in your praise . "
so he left there , before the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , Asaph and his brothers , to minister before the Ark continually , as every day 's work required ;
and Zadok the priest , and his brothers the priests , before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon ,
to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh , which he commanded to Israel ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Yahweh , because his loving kindness endures forever ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate .
it happened , when David lived in his house , that David said to Nathan the prophet , " behold , I dwell in a house of cedar , but the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh is under curtains . "
it happened the same night , that the word of God came to Nathan , saying ,
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
" now therefore , you shall tell my servant David , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " I took you from the sheep pen , from following the sheep , that you should be prince over my people Israel .
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . I will not take my loving kindness away from him , as I took it from him that was before you ;
but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever . his throne shall be established forever . " ' "
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so Nathan spoke to David .
then David the king went in , and sat before Yahweh ; and he said , " Who am I , Yahweh God , and what is my house , that you have brought me thus far ?
what can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant ? for you know your servant .
Yahweh , for your servant 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make known all these great things .
Yahweh , there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
now , Yahweh , let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant , and concerning his house , be established forever , and do as you have spoken .
now , Yahweh , you are God , and have promised this good thing to your servant .
after this it happened , that David struck the Philistines , and subdued them , and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines .
David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath , as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates .
David took from him one thousand chariots , and seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen ; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses , but reserved of them for one hundred chariots .
when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David struck of the Syrians twenty @-@ two thousand men .
then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus ; and the Syrians became servants to David , and brought tribute . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went .
David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
from Tibhath and from Cun , cities of Hadadezer , David took very much brass , with which Solomon made the bronze sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt Eighteen thousand .
David reigned over all Israel ; and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people .
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder ;
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
it happened after this , that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died , and his son reigned in his place .
so Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved them , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
so they hired for themselves thirty @-@ two thousand chariots , and the king of Maacah and his people , who came and encamped before Medeba . the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother ; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you are to help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will help you .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God . May Yahweh do that which seems good to him . "
so Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle ; and they fled before him .
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
it happened after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai , of the sons of the giant ; and they were subdued .
there was again war with the Philistines ; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
these were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword : and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword .
but he didn 't count Levi and Benjamin among them ; for the king 's word was abominable to Joab .
David said to God , " I have sinned greatly , in that I have done this thing . but now , put away , I beg you , the iniquity of your servant ; for I have done very foolishly . "
then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up , and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
David went up at the saying of Gad , which he spoke in the name of Yahweh .
Ornan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves . now Ornan was threshing wheat .
as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called on Yahweh ; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering .
at that time , when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite , then he sacrificed there .
for the tabernacle of Yahweh , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering , were at that time in the high place at Gibeon .
but David couldn 't go before it to inquire of God ; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh .
then David said , " This is the house of Yahweh God , and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel . "
David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build God 's house .
David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the couplings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
then he called for Solomon his son , and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh , the God of Israel .
David said to Solomon his son , " As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God .
he shall build a house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever . '
now , my son , may Yahweh be with you and prosper you , and build the house of Yahweh your God , as he has spoken concerning you .
May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding , and put you in charge of Israel ; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God .
then you will prosper , if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel . be strong , and courageous . Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed .
there are also workmen with you in abundance , cutters and workers of stone and timber , and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work :
of the gold , the silver , and the brass , and the iron , there is no number . arise and be doing , and may Yahweh be with you . "
David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son , saying ,
now David was old and full of days ; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty @-@ eight thousand .
David said , " Of these , twenty @-@ four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh ; six thousand were officers and judges ;
the sons of Shimei : Jahath , Zina , and Jeush , and Beriah . these four were the sons of Shimei .
Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah didn 't have many sons ; therefore they became a fathers ' house in one reckoning .
but as for Moses the man of God , his sons were named among the tribe of Levi .
the sons of Eliezer were : Rehabiah the chief ; and Eliezer had no other sons ; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many .
Eleazar died , and had no sons , but daughters only : and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives .
for by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered , from twenty years old and upward .
these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron . the sons of Aaron : Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
but Nadab and Abihu died before their father , and had no children : therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest 's office .
David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , divided them according to their ordering in their service .
of Rehabiah : of the sons of Rehabiah , Isshiah the chief .

of the sons of Asaph : Zaccur , and Joseph , and Nethaniah , and Asharelah , the sons of Asaph , under the hand of Asaph , who prophesied after the order of the king .
all these were the sons of Heman the king 's seer in the words of God , to lift up the Horn . God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh , even all who were skillful , was two hundred eighty @-@ eight .
they cast lots for their offices , all alike , as well the small as the great , the teacher as the scholar .
for the divisions of the doorkeepers : of the Korahites , Meshelemiah the son of kore , of the sons of Asaph .
Obed @-@ Edom had sons : Shemaiah the firstborn , Jehozabad the second , Joah the third , and Sacar the fourth , and Nethanel the fifth ,
also to Shemaiah his son were sons born , who ruled over the house of their father ; for they were mighty men of valor .
the sons of Shemaiah : Othni , and Rephael , and Obed , Elzabad , whose brothers were valiant men , Elihu , and Semachiah .
all these were of the sons of Obed @-@ Edom : they and their sons and their brothers , able men in strength for the service ; sixty @-@ two of Obed @-@ Edom .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons : Shimri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him chief ) ,
Hilkiah the second , Tebaliah the third , Zechariah the fourth : all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen .
of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers , even of the chief men , having offices like their brothers , to minister in the house of Yahweh .
they cast lots , the small as well as the great , according to their fathers ' houses , for every gate .
the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah . then for Zechariah his son , a wise counselor , they cast lots ; and his lot came out northward .
these were the divisions of the doorkeepers ; of the sons of the Korahites , and of the sons of Merari .
of the Levites , Ahijah was over the treasures of God 's house , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
the sons of Ladan , the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan , the heads of the fathers ' households belonging to Ladan the Gershonite : Jehieli .

the third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada the priest , chief : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
this is that Benaiah , who was the mighty man of the thirty , and over the thirty : and of his division was Ammizabad his son .
the fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab , and Zebadiah his son after him : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .

of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh in Gilead , Iddo the son of Zechariah : of Benjamin , Jaasiel the son of Abner :
but David didn 't take the number of them from twenty years old and under , because Yahweh had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky .
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but didn 't finish ; and there came wrath for this on Israel ; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David .
over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the towers , was Jonathan the son of Uzziah :

but God said to me , ' You shall not build a house for my name , because you are a man of war , and have shed blood . '
I will establish his kingdom forever , if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances , as at this day . '
take heed now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary . be strong , and do it . "
of gold by weight for the gold , for all vessels of every kind of service ; for all the vessels of silver by weight , for all vessels of every kind of service ;
and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread , for every table ; and silver for the tables of silver ;
and the forks , and the basins , and the cups , of pure gold ; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl ; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl ;
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot , the cherubim , that spread out , and covered the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh .
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , with which to overlay the walls of the houses ;
and they gave for the service of God 's house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass Eighteen thousand talents , and of iron a hundred thousand talents .
they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh , under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite .
then the people rejoiced , because they offered willingly , because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly ; and David said , " You are blessed , Yahweh , the God of Israel our father , forever and ever .
both riches and honor come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
for we are strangers before you , and foreigners , as all our fathers were . our days on the earth are as a shadow , and there is no remaining .
Yahweh our God , all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand , and is all your own .
then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father , and prospered ; and all Israel obeyed him .
all the princes , the mighty men , and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king .
Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years ; he reigned seven years in Hebron , and he reigned thirty @-@ three years in Jerusalem .
he died in a good old age , full of days , riches , and honor : and Solomon his son reigned in his place .
Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom , and Yahweh his God was with him , and magnified him exceedingly .
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tent of Meeting of God , which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness .
moreover the bronze altar , that Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there .
Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh , which was at the tent of Meeting , and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it .
now , Yahweh God , let your promise to David my father be established ; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
now give me wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people ; for who can judge this your people , that is so great ? "
so Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon , from before the tent of Meeting , to Jerusalem ; and he reigned over Israel .
the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue ; the king 's merchants purchased them from Kue .
Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens , and eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains , and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them .
even to prepare me timber in abundance ; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful .
then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon , " Because Yahweh loves his people , he has made you king over them . "
" now therefore the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa ; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem . "
Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel , after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them ; and they were found one hundred fifty @-@ three thousand six hundred .
he set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens , and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains , and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah , where Yahweh appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
he began to build in the second day of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
the porch that was in front , its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cubits , and the height one hundred twenty ; and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
the greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood , which he overlaid with fine gold , and ornamented it with palm trees and chains .
he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty : and the gold was gold of Parvaim .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the thresholds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and engraved cherubim on the walls .
the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold . he overlaid the upper rooms with gold .
in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work ; and they overlaid them with gold .
the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long : the wing of the one was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
the wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
the wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were toward the house .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty @-@ five cubits high , and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
he made chains in the oracle , and put them on the tops of the pillars ; and he made one hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
he set up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin , and the name of that on the left Boaz .
then he made an altar of brass , twenty cubits its length , and twenty cubits its breadth , and ten cubits its height .
also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass ; and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it .
under it was the likeness of oxen , which encircled it , for ten cubits , encircling the sea . the oxen were in two rows , cast when it was cast .
it was a handbreadth thick ; and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup , like the flower of a Lily : it received and held three thousand baths .
he made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them ; and he set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . he made one hundred basins of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid their doors with brass .
he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward , toward the south .
Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basins . so Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God 's house :
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars .
he made also the bases , and the basins made he on the bases ;
Huram his father also made the pots , the shovels , the forks , and all its vessels for king Solomon for the house of Yahweh of bright brass .
the king cast them in the plain of the Jordan , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah .
thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance : for the weight of the brass could not be found out .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in God 's house , the golden altar also , and the tables with the show bread on them ;
and the lampstands with their lamps , to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle , of pure gold ;
and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , of gold , and that perfect gold ;
and all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast , which was in the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ark , and the tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent ; these the priests the Levites brought up .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled to him , were before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark , and the cherubim covered the Ark and its poles above .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
there was nothing in the Ark except the two tables which Moses put at Horeb , when Yahweh made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of Yahweh filled God 's house .
but I have built you a house of habitation , and a place for you to dwell in forever . "
the king turned his face , and blessed all the assembly of Israel : and all the assembly of Israel stood .
he said , " blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David my father , and has with his hands fulfilled it , saying ,
now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
but Yahweh said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart :
nevertheless you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
there I have set the Ark , in which is the Covenant of Yahweh , which he made with the children of Israel . "
he stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
now therefore , Yahweh , the God of Israel , let your word be verified , which you spoke to your servant David .
" but will God indeed dwell with men on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain you ; how much less this house which I have built !
" if a man sin against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swears before your altar in this house ;
then hear from heaven , and forgive the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers .
whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house :
that they may fear you , to walk in your ways , so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers .
" if your people go out to battle against their enemies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
then hear from heaven , even from your dwelling place , their prayer and their petitions , and maintain their cause , and forgive your people who have sinned against you .
" now , my God , let , I beg you , your eyes be open , and let your ears be attentive , to the prayer that is made in this place .
now when Solomon had made an end of praying , the fire came down from heaven , and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices ; and the glory of Yahweh filled the house .
the priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh , because the glory of Yahweh filled Yahweh 's house .
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty @-@ two thousand head of cattle , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the people dedicated God 's house .
so Solomon held the feast at that time seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great assembly , from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt .
on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly : for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days , and the feast seven days .
on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents , joyful and glad of heart for the Goodness that Yahweh had shown to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him , " I have heard your prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
" if I shut up the sky so that there is no rain , or if I command the locust to devour the land , or if I send pestilence among my people ;
now my eyes shall be open , and my ears attentive , to the prayer that is made in this place .
for now have I chosen and made this house holy , that my name may be there forever ; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
but if you turn away , and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
this house , which is so high , everyone who passes by it shall be astonished , and shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh , and his own house ,
that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
also he built Beth Horon the upper , and Beth Horon the lower , fortified cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
as for all the people who were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ;
of their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel didn 't consume , of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day .
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
these were the chief officers of king Solomon , even two @-@ hundred fifty , who ruled over the people .
then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh , which he had built before the porch ,
they didn 't depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh , and until it was finished . so the house of Yahweh was completed .
then went Solomon to Ezion Geber , and to Eloth , on the seashore in the land of Edom .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
however I didn 't believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and behold , the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me : you exceed the fame that I heard .
happy are your men , and happy are these your servants , who stand continually before you , and hear your wisdom .
the servants also of Huram , and the servants of Solomon , who brought gold from Ophir , brought algum trees and precious stones .
King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides that which she had brought to the king . so she turned , and went to her own land , she and her servants .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty @-@ six talents of gold ,
besides that which the traders and merchants brought : and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon .
he made three hundred shields of beaten gold ; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
moreover the king made a great throne of Ivory , and overlaid it with pure gold .
and there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any kingdom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
for the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram ; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish , bringing gold , and silver , Ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
they brought every man his tribute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clothing , armor , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
he ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines , and to the border of Egypt .
the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt , and out of all lands .
Solomon slept with his fathers , and he was buried in the city of David his father : and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place .
they sent and called him ; and Jeroboam and all Israel came , and they spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
they spoke to him , saying , " If you are kind to this people , and please them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke . my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with Scorpions . ' "
but as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
" speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin , saying ,
and Zorah , and Aijalon , and Hebron , which are in Judah and in Benjamin , fortified cities .
the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Yahweh ;
and he appointed him priests for the high places , and for the male goats , and for the calves which he had made .
Rehoboam took him a wife , Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David , and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse ;
Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took Eighteen wives , and sixty concubines , and became the father of twenty @-@ eight sons and sixty daughters . )
Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief , the prince among his brothers ; for he intended to make him king .
it happened , when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established , and he was strong , that he forsook the law of Yahweh , and all Israel with him .
it happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , because they had trespassed against Yahweh ,
with twelve hundred chariots , and sixty thousand horsemen . the people were without number who came with him out of Egypt : the Lubim , the Sukkiim , and the Ethiopians .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Yahweh , the guard came and bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
when he humbled himself , the wrath of Yahweh turned from him , so as not to destroy him altogether : and moreover in Judah there were good things found .
he did that which was evil , because he didn 't set his heart to seek Yahweh .
he reigned three years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah . there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam .
Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim , which is in the hill country of Ephraim , and said , " Hear me , Jeroboam and all Israel :
ought you not to know that Yahweh , the God of Israel , gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever , even to him and to his sons by a Covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and rebelled against his lord .
there were gathered to him worthless men , base fellows , who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted , and could not withstand them .
but Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them : so they were before Judah , and the ambush was behind them .
when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind them ; and they cried to Yahweh , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it happened , that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter : so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied on Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
Abijah pursued after Jeroboam , and took cities from him , Bethel with its towns , and Jeshanah with its towns , and Ephron with its towns .
but Abijah grew mighty , and took to himself fourteen wives , and became the father of twenty @-@ two sons , and sixteen daughters .
the rest of the acts of Abijah , and his ways , and his sayings , are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo .
so Abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David ; and ASA his son reigned in his place . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
ASA did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God :
for he took away the foreign altars , and the high places , and broke down the pillars , and cut down the Asherim ,
and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops , and three hundred chariots ; and he came to Mareshah .
they struck all the cities around Gerar ; for the fear of Yahweh came on them : and they despoiled all the cities ; for there was much spoil in them .
they struck also the tents of livestock , and carried away sheep in abundance , and camels , and returned to Jerusalem .
now for a long time Israel was without the true God , and without a teaching priest , and without law .
but when in their distress they turned to Yahweh , the God of Israel , and sought him , he was found by them .
in those times there was no peace to him who went out , nor to him who came in ; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands .
they were broken in pieces , nation against nation , and city against city ; for God troubled them with all adversity .
but you be strong , and don 't let your hands be Slack ; for your work shall be rewarded . "
so they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of ASA .
they sacrificed to Yahweh in that day , of the spoil which they had brought , seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep .
they entered into the Covenant to seek Yahweh , the God of their fathers , with all their heart and with all their soul ;
and that whoever would not seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
they swore to Yahweh with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
all Judah rejoiced at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and Yahweh gave them rest all around .
but the high places were not taken away out of Israel : nevertheless the heart of ASA was perfect all his days .
he brought into God 's house the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
then ASA brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria , who lived at Damascus , saying ,
Ben Hadad listened to king ASA , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they struck Ijon , and Dan , and Abel Maim , and all the storage cities of Naphtali .
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and let his work cease .
then ASA the king took all Judah ; and they carried away the stones of Ramah , and its timber , with which Baasha had built ; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah .
Weren 't the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army , with chariots and horsemen exceeding many ? yet , because you relied on Yahweh , he delivered them into your hand .
behold , the acts of ASA , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
in the thirty @-@ ninth year of his reign ASA was diseased in his feet ; his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he didn 't seek Yahweh , but to the physicians .
ASA slept with his fathers , and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign .
he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which ASA his father had taken .
Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat , because he walked in the first ways of his father David , and didn 't seek the Baals ,
but sought to the God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
his heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh : and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah .
also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes , even Ben hail , and Obadiah , and Zechariah , and Nethanel , and Micaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah ;
they taught in Judah , having the book of the law of Yahweh with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught among the people .
the fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah , so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents , and silver for tribute ; the Arabians also brought him flocks , seven thousand and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats .
he had many works in the cities of Judah ; and men of war , mighty men of valor , in Jerusalem .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand ;
and next to him Jehohanan the captain , and with him two hundred eighty thousand ;
and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself to Yahweh ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor .
and next to him Jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready prepared for war .
these were those who waited on the king , besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah .
after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria . Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance , and for the people who were with him , and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead .
Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , " Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh . "
Micaiah said , " Therefore hear the word of Yahweh : I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne , and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left .
" now therefore , behold , Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets ; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you . "
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you ? "
Micaiah said , " behold , you shall see on that day , when you shall go into an inner room to hide yourself . "
the king of Israel said , " Take Micaiah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots , saying , " Fight neither with small nor great , except only with the king of Israel . "
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
the battle increased that day . however the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening ; and about the time of the going down of the sun , he died .
nevertheless there are good things found in you , in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land , and have set your heart to seek God . "
Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem : and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim , and brought them back to Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah , city by city ,
and said to the judges , " consider what you do : for you don 't judge for man , but for Yahweh ; and he is with you in the judgment .
moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests , and of the heads of the fathers ' households of Israel , for the judgment of Yahweh , and for controversies . they returned to Jerusalem .
he commanded them , saying , " Thus you shall do in the fear of Yahweh , faithfully , and with a perfect heart .
it happened after this , that the children of Moab , and the children of Ammon , and with them some of the Ammonites , came against Jehoshaphat to battle .
Jehoshaphat was alarmed , and set himself to seek to Yahweh . he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah .
Didn 't you , our God , drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel , and give it to the seed of Abraham your friend forever ?
they lived in it , and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name , saying ,
behold , how they reward us , to come to cast us out of your possession , which you have given us to inherit .
our God , will you not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us ; neither know we what to do , but our eyes are on you . "
all Judah stood before Yahweh , with their little ones , their wives , and their children .
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , the Levite , of the sons of Asaph , in the midst of the assembly ;
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground ; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Yahweh , worshipping Yahweh .
the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites , stood up to praise Yahweh , the God of Israel , with an exceeding loud voice .
when they began to sing and to praise , Yahweh set ambushers against the children of Ammon , Moab , and Mount Seir , who had come against Judah ; and they were struck .
when Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness , they looked at the multitude ; and behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and there were none who escaped .
on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah ; for there they blessed Yahweh : therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in their forefront , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries , when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel .
he walked in the way of ASA his father , and didn 't turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh .
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers .
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish ; and they made the ships in Ezion Geber .
Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Jehoram his son reigned in his place .
he had brothers , the sons of Jehoshaphat : Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah ; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father , and had strengthened himself , he killed all his brothers with the sword , and various also of the princes of Israel .
Jehoram was thirty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
however Yahweh would not destroy the house of David , because of the Covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always .
in his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah , and made a king over themselves .
then Jehoram passed over with his captains , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , along with the captains of the chariots .
so Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day : then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand , because he had forsaken Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah , and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute , and led Judah astray .
behold , Yahweh will strike with a great plague your people , and your children , and your wives , and all your substance ;
and you shall have great sickness by disease of your bowels , until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness , day by day . ' "
Yahweh stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines , and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians :
he also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab ; for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did the house of Ahab ; for they were his counselors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
he walked also after their counsel , and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead : and the Syrians wounded Joram .
it happened , when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab , that he found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah , ministering to Ahaziah , and killed them .
now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah .
they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the heads of fathers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
all the assembly made a Covenant with the king in God 's house . he said to them , " behold , the king 's son shall reign , as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David .
a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation . all the people shall be in the courts of Yahweh 's house .
but let no one come into the house of Yahweh , except the priests , and those who minister of the Levites . they shall come in , for they are holy , but all the people shall follow Yahweh 's instructions .
the Levites shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . whoever comes into the house , let him be slain . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king David 's , which were in God 's house .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king , she came to the people into the house of Yahweh :
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
Jehoiada made a Covenant between himself , and all the people , and the king , that they should be Yahweh 's people .
all the people went to the house of Baal , and broke it down , and broke his altars and his images in pieces , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
he set the porters at the gates of the house of Yahweh , that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in .
so all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was quiet . Athaliah they had slain with the sword .
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zibiah , of Beersheba .
Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest .
for the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up God 's house ; and they also gave all the dedicated things of the house of Yahweh to the Baals .
so the king commanded , and they made a chest , and set it outside at the gate of the house of Yahweh .
they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness .
all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
so the workmen worked , and the work of repairing went forward in their hands , and they set up God 's house in its state , and strengthened it .
but Jehoiada grew old and was full of days , and he died ; one hundred thirty years old was he when he died .
they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , and toward God and his house .
now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah , and made obeisance to the king . then the king listened to them .
they forsook the house of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and served the Asherim and the idols : and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness .
yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again to Yahweh ; and they testified against them : but they would not give ear .
they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Yahweh .
thus Joash the king didn 't remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but killed his son . when he died , he said , " May Yahweh look at it , and repay it . "
these are those who conspired against him : Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess .
Amaziah was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan , of Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , but not with a perfect heart .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
he hired also one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver .
a man of God came to him , saying , " O king , don 't let the army of Israel go with you ; for Yahweh is not with Israel , with all the children of Ephraim .
then Amaziah separated them , the army that had come to him out of Ephraim , to go home again : therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in fierce anger .
Amaziah took courage , and led forth his people , and went to the Valley of Salt , and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir .
the children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers , and sent to Joash , the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
but Amaziah would not listen ; for it was of God , that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they had sought after the gods of Edom .
so Joash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
Judah was defeated by Israel ; and they fled every man to his tent .
now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , aren 't they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ?
now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh , they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem . he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish , and killed him there .
all the people of Judah took Uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jechiliah , of Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that his father Amaziah had done .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yahweh , God made him to prosper .
he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and broke down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod ; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah : and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt ; for he grew exceeding strong .
moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
the whole number of the heads of fathers ' households , even the mighty men of valor , was two thousand and six hundred .
under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , who made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
Uzziah prepared for them , even for all the army , shields , and spears , and helmets , and coats of mail , and bows , and stones for slinging .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did corruptly , and he trespassed against Yahweh his God ; for he went into Yahweh 's temple to burn incense on the altar of incense .
Azariah the priest went in after him , and with him eighty priests of Yahweh , who were valiant men :
now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first and last , Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , wrote .
Jotham was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that his father Uzziah had done : however he didn 't enter into Yahweh 's temple . the people still did corruptly .
moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah , and in the forests he built castles and towers .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
Jotham slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David : and Ahaz his son reigned in his place .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , like David his father ;
but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel , and made also molten images for the Baals .
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day , all of them valiant men ; because they had forsaken Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , killed Maaseiah the king 's son , and Azrikam the ruler of the house , and Elkanah who was next to the king .
the children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids for yourselves . Aren 't there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God ?
now hear me therefore , and send back the captives , that you have taken captive from your brothers ; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you . "
so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly .
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh , and out of the house of the king and of the princes , and gave it to the king of Assyria : but it didn 't help him .
in the time of his distress , he trespassed yet more against Yahweh , this same king Ahaz .
in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods , and provoked to anger Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
now the rest of his acts , and all his ways , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem ; for they didn 't bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place .
Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty @-@ five years old ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that David his father had done .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of Yahweh , and repaired them .
he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them together into the broad place on the east ,
and said to them , " listen to me , you Levites ! now sanctify yourselves , and sanctify the house of Yahweh , the God of your fathers , and carry out the filthiness out of the holy place .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh , and turned their backs .
also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel .
for , behold , our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this .
now it is in my heart to make a Covenant with Yahweh , the God of Israel , that his fierce anger may turn away from us .
my sons , don 't be negligent now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him , to minister to him , and that you should be his ministers , and burn incense . "
they gathered their brothers , and sanctified themselves , and went in , according to the commandment of the king by the words of Yahweh , to cleanse the house of Yahweh .
moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign threw away when he trespassed , have we prepared and sanctified ; and behold , they are before the altar of Yahweh . "
then Hezekiah the king arose early , and gathered the princes of the city , and went up to the house of Yahweh .
they brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly ; and they laid their hands on them :
when they had made an end of offering , the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls , one hundred rams , and two hundred lambs : all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace offerings , and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering . so the service of the house of Yahweh was set in order .
Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem , to keep the Passover to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the assembly in Jerusalem , to keep the Passover in the second month .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number , neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem .
the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly .
so the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh , even to Zebulun : but they ridiculed them , and mocked them .
also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart , to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Yahweh .
many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month , a very great assembly .
they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the Brook Kidron .
then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves : therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean , to sanctify them to Yahweh .
for Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
all the assembly of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Judah , rejoiced .
so there was great joy in Jerusalem ; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem .
then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people : and their voice was heard , and their prayer came up to his holy habitation , even to heaven .
moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might give themselves to the law of Yahweh .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps , they blessed Yahweh , and his people Israel .
then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps .
then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of Yahweh ; and they prepared them .
Hezekiah did so throughout all Judah ; and he worked that which was good and right and faithful before Yahweh his God .
after these things , and this faithfulness , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fortified cities , and thought to win them for himself .
when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come , and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem ,
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
so many people gathered together , and they stopped all the springs , and the Brook that flowed through the midst of the land , saying , " Why should the kings of Assyria come , and find much water ? "
he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
Doesn 't Hezekiah persuade you , to give you over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ' Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ? '
Don 't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
they spoke of the God of Jerusalem , as of the gods of the peoples of the earth , which are the work of men 's hands .
Hezekiah the king , and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz , prayed because of this , and cried to heaven .
thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem , and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah ; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth .
in those days Hezekiah was sick even to death : and he prayed to Yahweh ; and he spoke to him , and gave him a sign .
but Hezekiah didn 't render again according to the benefit done to him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wrath on him , and on Judah and Jerusalem .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Yahweh didn 't come on them in the days of Hezekiah .
Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor : and he provided him treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all kinds of goodly vessels ;
storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil ; and stalls for all kinds of animals , and flocks in folds .
this same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon , and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David . Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his good deeds , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz , in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ five years in Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
he built altars in the house of Yahweh , of which Yahweh said , " My name shall be in Jerusalem forever . "
he built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh .
Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that they did more evil than the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel did .
Yahweh spoke to Manasseh , and to his people ; but they gave no heed .
therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria , who took Manasseh in chains , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
he prayed to him ; and he was entreated by him , and heard his supplication , and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom . then Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God .
he built up the altar of Yahweh , and offered thereon sacrifices of peace offerings and of Thanksgiving , and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh , the God of Israel .
Amon was twenty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did Manasseh his father ; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them .
he didn 't humble himself before Yahweh , as Manasseh his father had humbled himself ; but this same Amon trespassed more and more .
his servants conspired against him , and put him to death in his own house .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty @-@ one years in Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in the ways of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
he did this in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon , even to Naphtali , around in their ruins .
he broke down the altars , and beat the Asherim and the engraved images into powder , and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel , and returned to Jerusalem .
they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh ; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house ;
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh , Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Yahweh given by Moses .
Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan .
Shaphan carried the book to the king , and moreover brought back word to the king , saying , " All that was committed to your servants , they are doing .
Shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , " Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book . " Shaphan read therein before the king .
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he tore his clothes .
the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah .
but to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Yahweh , thus you shall tell him , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : " as touching the words which you have heard ,
he caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand . the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the Covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem : and they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month .
he set the priests in their offices , and encouraged them to the service of the house of Yahweh .
prepare yourselves after your fathers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fathers ' house of the Levites .
kill the Passover , and sanctify yourselves , and prepare for your brothers , to do according to the word of Yahweh by Moses . "
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites by their divisions , according to the king 's commandment .
they killed the Passover , and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand , and the Levites flayed them .
they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day , to keep the Passover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh , according to the commandment of king Josiah .
after all this , when Josiah had prepared the temple , Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates : and Josiah went out against him .
the archers shot at king Josiah ; and the king said to his servants , " Take me away , because I am seriously wounded ! "
Jeremiah lamented for Josiah : and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day ; and they made them an ordinance in Israel : and behold , they are written in the lamentations .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and his good deeds , according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh ,
and his acts , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and made him king in his father 's place in Jerusalem .
Joahaz was twenty @-@ three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God .
against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to Babylon .
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of Yahweh , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem :
and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God ; he didn 't humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Yahweh .
he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God : but he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
moreover all the chiefs of the priests , and the people , trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations ; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had made holy in Jerusalem .
Yahweh , the God of their fathers , sent to them by his messengers , rising up early and sending , because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
but they mocked the messengers of God , and despised his words , and scoffed at his prophets , until the wrath of Yahweh arose against his people , until there was no remedy .
they burnt God 's house , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all its palaces with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it .
he carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon ; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
then the heads of fathers ' households of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with precious things , besides all that was willingly offered .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . Sheshbazzar brought all these up , when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem .
the children of Parosh , two thousand one hundred seventy @-@ two .
the children of Shephatiah , three hundred seventy @-@ two .
the children of Arah , seven hundred seventy @-@ five .
the children of Pahathmoab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand eight hundred twelve .
the children of Elam , one thousand two hundred fifty @-@ four .
the children of Zattu , nine hundred forty @-@ five .
the children of Zaccai , seven hundred sixty .
the children of Bani , six hundred forty @-@ two .
the children of Bebai , six hundred twenty @-@ three .
the children of Azgad , one thousand two hundred twenty @-@ two .
the children of Adonikam , six hundred sixty @-@ six .
the children of Bigvai , two thousand fifty @-@ six .
the children of Adin , four hundred fifty @-@ four .
the children of Ater , of Hezekiah , ninety @-@ eight .
the children of Bezai , three hundred twenty @-@ three .
the children of Jorah , one hundred twelve .
the children of Hashum , two hundred twenty @-@ three .
the children of Gibbar , ninety @-@ five .
the men of Netophah , fifty @-@ six .
the children of Azmaveth , forty @-@ two .
the children of Ramah and Geba , six hundred twenty @-@ one .
the men of Bethel and AI , two hundred twenty @-@ three .
the children of Magbish , one hundred fifty @-@ six .
the children of the other Elam , one thousand two hundred fifty @-@ four .
the children of Lod , Hadid , and Ono , seven hundred twenty @-@ five .
the children of Jericho , three hundred forty @-@ five .
the children of Senaah , three thousand six hundred thirty .
the priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy @-@ three .
the children of Immer , one thousand fifty @-@ two .
the children of Pashhur , one thousand two hundred forty @-@ seven .
the Levites : the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel , of the children of Hodaviah , seventy @-@ four .
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all one hundred thirty @-@ nine .
the Nethinim : the children of Ziha , the children of Hasupha , the children of Tabbaoth ,
the children of Keros , the children of Siaha , the children of Padon ,
the children of Lebanah , the children of Hagabah , the children of Akkub ,
the children of Hagab , the children of Shamlai , the children of Hanan ,
the children of Giddel , the children of Gahar , the children of Reaiah ,
the children of Rezin , the children of Nekoda , the children of Gazzam ,
the children of Uzza , the children of Paseah , the children of Besai ,
the children of Asnah , the children of Meunim , the children of Nephisim ,
the children of Bakbuk , the children of Hakupha , the children of Harhur ,
the children of Bazluth , the children of Mehida , the children of Harsha ,
the children of Barkos , the children of Sisera , the children of Temah ,
the children of Neziah , the children of Hatipha .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Hassophereth , the children of Peruda ,
the children of Jaalah , the children of Darkon , the children of Giddel ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Ami .
all the Nethinim , and the children of Solomon 's servants , were three hundred ninety @-@ two .
these were those who went up from Tel Melah , Tel Harsha , Cherub , Addan , and Immer ; but they could not show their fathers ' houses , and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred fifty @-@ two .
of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
these sought their place among those who were registered by genealogy , but they were not found : therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim .
some of the heads of fathers ' households , when they came to the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem , offered willingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work sixty @-@ one thousand darics of gold , and five thousand minas of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
when the seventh month had come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem .
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the altar on its base ; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
they kept the feast of tents , as it is written , and offered the daily burnt offerings by number , according to the ordinance , as the duty of every day required ;
and afterward the continual burnt offering , the offerings of the new moons , of all the set feasts of Yahweh that were consecrated , and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to Yahweh .
from the first day of the seventh month , they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh ; but the foundation of Yahweh 's temple was not yet laid .
now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to Yahweh , the God of Israel ;
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah , and troubled them in building ,
and hired counselors against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of Darius king of Persia .
in the reign of Ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem .
this is the copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king : your servants the men beyond the River , and so forth .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tribute , custom , or toll , and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings .
now because we eat the salt of the palace , and it is not appropriate for us to see the king 's dishonor , therefore have we sent and informed the king ;
I decreed , and search has been made , and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein .
there have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem , who have ruled over all the country beyond the River ; and tribute , custom , and toll , was paid to them .
make a decree now to cause these men to cease , and that this city not be built , until a decree shall be made by me .
take heed that you not be Slack herein : why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
then when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build God 's house which is at Jerusalem ; and with them were the prophets of God , helping them .
then we told them in this way , what the names of the men were who were making this building .
but the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews , and they did not make them cease , until the matter should come to Darius , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the copy of the letter that Tattenai , the governor beyond the River , and Shetharbozenai , and his companions the Apharsachites , who were beyond the River , sent to Darius the king ;
they sent a letter to him , in which was written thus : to Darius the king , all peace .
then we asked those elders , and said to them thus , " Who gave you a decree to build this house , and to finish this wall ? "
we asked them their names also , to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head .
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
but in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon , Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God .
and he said to him , ' Take these vessels , go , put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let God 's house be built in its place . '
then the same Sheshbazzar came , and laid the foundations of God 's house which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now has it been in building , and yet it is not completed .
then Darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the archives , where the treasures were laid up in Babylon .
there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of Media , a scroll , and therein was thus written for a record :
leave the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place .
that they may offer sacrifices of pleasant aroma to the God of heaven , and pray for the life of the king , and of his sons .
then Tattenai , the governor beyond the River , Shetharbozenai , and their companions , because Darius the king had sent a decree , did accordingly with all diligence .
this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
for the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together ; all of them were pure : and they killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brothers the priests , and for themselves .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the captivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land , to seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , ate ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
for Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances .
Artaxerxes , king of kings , to Ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the God of heaven , perfect and so forth .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Levites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
because you are sent of the king and his seven counselors , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of your God which is in your hand ,
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver before the God of Jerusalem .
whatever more shall be needful for the house of your God , which you shall have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king 's treasure house .
whatever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven ; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
now these are the heads of their fathers ' households , and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon , in the reign of Artaxerxes the king :
of the sons of Phinehas , Gershom . of the sons of Ithamar , Daniel . of the sons of David , Hattush .
of the sons of Shecaniah , of the sons of Parosh , Zechariah ; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males one hundred fifty .
of the sons of Pahathmoab , Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah ; and with him two hundred males .
of the sons of Shecaniah , the son of Jahaziel ; and with him three hundred males .
of the sons of Adin , Ebed the son of Jonathan ; and with him fifty males .
of the sons of Elam , Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah ; and with him seventy males .
of the sons of Shephatiah , Zebadiah the son of Michael ; and with him eighty males .
of the sons of Joab , Obadiah the son of Jehiel ; and with him two hundred and Eighteen males .
of the sons of Shelomith , the son of Josiphiah ; and with him one hundred sixty males .
of the sons of Bebai , Zechariah the son of Bebai ; and with him twenty @-@ eight males .
of the sons of Azgad , Johanan the son of Hakkatan ; and with him one hundred ten males .
of the sons of Adonikam , who were the last ; and these are their names : Eliphelet , Jeuel , and Shemaiah ; and with them sixty males .
of the sons of Bigvai , Uthai and Zabbud ; and with them seventy males .
I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava ; and there we encamped three days : and I viewed the people , and the priests , and found there none of the sons of Levi .
and Hashabiah , and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari , his brothers and their sons , twenty ;
and of the Nethinim , whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinim : all of them were mentioned by name .
then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests , even Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their brothers with them ,
I weighed into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver , and silver vessels one hundred talents ; of gold one hundred talents ;
and twenty bowls of gold , of one thousand darics ; and two vessels of fine bright brass , precious as gold .
I said to them , " You are holy to Yahweh , and the vessels are holy ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh , the God of your fathers .
watch , and keep them , until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites , and the princes of the fathers ' households of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the rooms of the house of Yahweh . "
so the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God .
the whole by number and by weight : and all the weight was written at that time .
when I heard this thing , I tore my garment and my robe , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down confounded .
then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of their trespass of the captivity ; and I sat confounded until the evening offering .
at the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation , even with my garment and my robe torn ; and I fell on my knees , and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God ;
and I said , " My God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our iniquities have increased over our head , and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens .
then Ezra arose , and made the chiefs of the priests , the Levites , and all Israel , to swear that they would do according to this word . so they swore .
they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem ;
then all the assembly answered with a loud voice , " As you have said concerning us , so must we do .
only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this ; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them .
they made an end with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month .
they gave their hand that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt .
of the sons of Harim : Maaseiah , and Elijah , and Shemaiah , and Jehiel , and Uzziah .
of the Levites : Jozabad , and Shimei , and Kelaiah ( the same is Kelita ) , Pethahiah , Judah , and Eliezer .
of Israel : of the sons of Parosh : Ramiah , and Izziah , and Malchijah , and Mijamin , and Eleazar , and Malchijah , and Benaiah .
of the sons of Elam : Mattaniah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , and Abdi , and Jeremoth , and Elijah .
of the sons of Zattu : Elioenai , Eliashib , Mattaniah , and Jeremoth , and Zabad , and Aziza .
of the sons of Bani : Meshullam , Malluch , and Adaiah , Jashub , and Sheal , Jeremoth .
all these had taken foreign wives ; and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
the words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah . now it happened in the month Chislev , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the palace ,
they said to me , " The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach . the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and its gates are burned with fire . "
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days ; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven ,
and said , " I beg you , Yahweh , the God of heaven , the great and awesome God , who keeps Covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments :
we have dealt very corruptly against you , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the ordinances , which you commanded your servant Moses .
" remember , I beg you , the word that you commanded your servant Moses , saying , ' If you trespass , I will scatter you abroad among the peoples ;
" now these are your servants and your people , whom you have redeemed by your great power , and by your strong hand .
then I came to the governors beyond the River , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
then I went on to the spring gate and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass .
then went I up in the night by the Brook , and viewed the wall ; and I turned back , and entered by the valley gate , and so returned .

but it happened that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall , he was angry , and took great indignation , and mocked the Jews .
now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him , and he said , " What they are building , if a Fox climbed up it , he would break down their stone wall . "
Don 't cover their iniquity , and don 't let their sin be blotted out from before you ; for they have insulted the builders . "
so we built the wall ; and all the wall was joined together to half its height : for the people had a mind to work .
but we made our prayer to our God , and set a watch against them day and night , because of them .
it happened that when the Jews who lived by them came , they said to us ten times from all places , " wherever you turn , they will attack us . "
therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , in the open places , I set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
it happened , when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their counsel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
they all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves ; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work , and with the other held his weapon ;
and the builders , everyone wore his sword at his side , and so built . he who sounded the trumpet was by me .
I said to the nobles , and to the rulers and to the rest of the people , " The work is great and large , and we are separated on the wall , one far from another .
wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet , rally there to us . our God will fight for us . "
so we worked in the work : and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may labor in the day . "
so neither I , nor my brothers , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard who followed me , none of us took off our clothes . everyone took his weapon to the water .
for there were that said , " We , our sons and our daughters , are many . let us get grain , that we may eat and live . "
also I said , " The thing that you do is not good . ought you not to walk in the fear of our God , because of the reproach of the nations our enemies ?
yes , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered there to the work .
that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me , saying , " Come , let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono . " but they intended to harm me .
then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand ,
then I sent to him , saying , " There are no such things done as you say , but you imagine them out of your own heart . "
he hired so that I would be afraid , do so , and sin , and that they might have material for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
so the wall was finished in the twenty @-@ fifth day of Elul , in fifty @-@ two days .
moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah , and Tobiah 's letters came to them .
now it happened , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
that I put my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the governor of the castle , in charge of Jerusalem ; for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
now the city was wide and large ; but the people were few therein , and the houses were not built .

the children of Jaala , the children of Darkon , the children of Giddel ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Amon .
all the Nethinim , and the children of Solomon 's servants , were three hundred ninety @-@ two .
these were those who went up from Tel Melah , Tel Harsha , Cherub , Addon , and Immer ; but they could not show their fathers ' houses , nor their seed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred forty @-@ two .
of the priests : the children of Hobaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
these searched for their geneological records , but couldn 't find them . therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim .
besides their male servants and their female servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty @-@ seven : and they had two hundred forty @-@ five singing men and singing women .
some from among the heads of fathers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred thirty priests ' garments .
some of the heads of fathers ' households gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold , and two thousand two hundred minas of silver .
that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold , and two thousand minas of silver , and sixty @-@ seven priests ' garments .
Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly , both men and women , and all who could hear with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .
Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
and Ezra blessed Yahweh , the great God . all the people answered , " Amen , Amen , " with the lifting up of their hands . they bowed their heads , and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground .
they read in the book , in the law of God , distinctly ; and they gave the sense , so that they understood the reading .
so the Levites stilled all the people , saying , " Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be grieved . "
all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared to them .
now in the twenty @-@ fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting , and with sackcloth , and earth on them .
the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners , and stood and confessed their sins , and the iniquities of their fathers .
they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day ; and a fourth part they confessed , and worshiped Yahweh their God .
then Jeshua , and Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani of the Levites stood up on the stairs , and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God .
you are Yahweh , the God who chose Abram , and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gave him the name of Abraham ,
" you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt , and heard their cry by the Red Sea ,
you divided the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and you cast their pursuers into the depths , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover , in a pillar of cloud you led them by day ; and in a pillar of fire by night , to give them light in the way in which they should go .
" you came down also on Mount Sinai , and spoke with them from heaven , and gave them right ordinances and true laws , good statutes and commandments ,
and made known to them your holy Sabbath , and commanded them commandments , and statutes , and a law , by Moses your servant ,
" but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck , didn 't listen to your commandments ,
yes , when they had made them a molten calf , and said , ' This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ' and had committed awful blasphemies ;
you gave also your good Spirit to instruct them , and didn 't withhold your manna from their mouth , and gave them water for their thirst .
" yes , forty years you sustained them in the wilderness . they lacked nothing . their clothes didn 't grow old , and their feet didn 't swell .
you also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
" nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed awful blasphemies .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets . yet would they not give ear . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
" nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them , nor forsake them ; for you are a gracious and merciful God .
however you are just in all that has come on us ; for you have dealt truly , but we have done wickedly ;
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept your law , nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them .
for they have not served you in their kingdom , and in your great Goodness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their wicked works .
" behold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good , behold , we are servants in it .
now those who sealed were : Nehemiah the governor , the son of Hacaliah , and Zedekiah ,
the Levites : namely , Jeshua the son of Azaniah , Binnui of the sons of Henadad , Kadmiel ;
and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons ;
and to bring the first fruits of our ground , and the first fruits of all fruit of all kinds of trees , year by year , to the house of Yahweh ;
the princes of the people lived in Jerusalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city , and nine parts in the other cities .
the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem .
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch , the son of Colhozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of the Shilonite .
all the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were four hundred sixty @-@ eight valiant men .
Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer ; and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city .
and their brothers , mighty men of valor , one hundred twenty @-@ eight ; and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of Haggedolim .
of the Levites : Shemaiah the son of Hasshub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Bunni ;
and Shabbethai and Jozabad , of the chiefs of the Levites , who had the oversight of the outward business of God 's house ;
all the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty @-@ four .
moreover the porters , Akkub , Talmon , and their brothers , who kept watch at the gates , were one hundred seventy @-@ two .
the residue of Israel , of the priests , the Levites , were in all the cities of Judah , everyone in his inheritance .
for there was a commandment from the king concerning them , and a settled provision for the singers , as every day required .
Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel , of the children of Zerah the son of Judah , was at the king 's hand in all matters concerning the people .
as for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its towns , and in Dibon and its towns , and in Jekabzeel and its villages ,
the children of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward , at Michmash and Aija , and at Bethel and its towns ,
now these are the priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua : Seraiah , Jeremiah , Ezra ,
moreover the Levites : Jeshua , Binnui , Kadmiel , Sherebiah , Judah , and Mattaniah , who was over the Thanksgiving , he and his brothers .
also Bakbukiah and Unno , their brothers , were over against them according to their offices .
Jeshua became the father of Joiakim , and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib , and Eliashib became the father of Joiada ,
and Joiada became the father of Jonathan , and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua .
in the days of Joiakim were priests , heads of fathers ' households : of Seraiah , Meraiah ; of Jeremiah , Hananiah ;
the sons of Levi , heads of fathers ' households , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
the priests and the Levites purified themselves ; and they purified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
and after them went Hoshaiah , and half of the princes of Judah ,
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets : Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph ;
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
so stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in God 's house , and I , and the half of the rulers with me ;
and Maaseiah , and Shemaiah , and Eleazar , and Uzzi , and Jehohanan , and Malchijah , and Elam , and Ezer . the singers sang loud , with Jezrahiah their overseer .
they performed the duty of their God , and the duty of the purification , and so did the singers and the porters , according to the commandment of David , and of Solomon his son .
for in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers , and songs of praise and Thanksgiving to God .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
because they didn 't meet the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Balaam against them , to curse them : however our God turned the curse into a blessing .
it came to pass , when they had heard the law , that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude .
now before this , Eliashib the priest , who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God , being allied to Tobiah ,
but in all this , I was not at Jerusalem ; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king : and after certain days asked I leave of the king ,
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah , in preparing him a room in the courts of God 's house .
it grieved me severely : therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the room .
then I commanded , and they cleansed the rooms : and there brought I again the vessels of God 's house , with the meal offerings and the frankincense .
I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them ; so that the Levites and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
then I contended with the rulers , and said , " Why is God 's house forsaken ? " I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
remember me , my God , concerning this , and don 't wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for its observances .
there lived men of Tyre also therein , who brought in fish , and all kinds of wares , and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said to them , " What evil thing is this that you do , and profane the Sabbath day ?
so the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice .
in those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod , of Ammon , and of Moab :
and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son @-@ in @-@ law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
remember them , my God , because they have defiled the priesthood , and the Covenant of the priesthood , and of the Levites .
thus I cleansed them from all foreigners , and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites , everyone in his work ;
now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus ( this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia , over one hundred twenty @-@ seven provinces ) ,
that in those days , when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him .
he displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days , even one hundred eighty days .
they gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds , including royal wine in abundance , according to the bounty of the king .
in accordance with the law , the drinking was not compulsory ; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleasure .
also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus .
but the queen Vashti refused to come at the king 's commandment by the eunuchs . therefore the king was very angry , and his anger burned in him .
then the king said to the wise men , who knew the times , ( for it was the king 's custom to consult those who knew law and judgment ;
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom ( for it is great ) , all the wives will give their husbands honor , both great and small . "
this advice pleased the king and the princes , and the king did according to the word of Memucan :
after these things , when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified , he remembered Vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
there was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ,
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives , because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known .
Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women 's house , to find out how Esther was doing , and what would become of her .
so Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month , which is the month Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
when the virgins were gathered together the second time , Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate .
Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people , as Mordecai had commanded her ; for Esther obeyed Mordecai , like she did when she was brought up by him .
in those days , while Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh , who were doorkeepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus .
this thing became known to Mordecai , who informed Esther the queen ; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai 's name .
after these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , and advanced him , and set his seat above all the princes who were with him .
then the king 's servants , who were in the king 's gate , said to Mordecai , " Why do you disobey the king 's commandment ? "
when Haman saw that Mordecai didn 't bow down , nor pay him Homage , Haman was full of wrath .
the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews ' enemy .
the king said to Haman , " The silver is given to you , the people also , to do with them as it seems good to you . "
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that they should be ready against that day .
the couriers went forth in haste by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa . the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city of Shushan was perplexed .
now when Mordecai found out all that was done , Mordecai tore his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and wailed loudly and a bitterly .
he came even before the king 's gate , for no one is allowed inside the king 's gate clothed with sackcloth .
Esther 's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this , and the queen was exceedingly grieved . she sent clothing to Mordecai , to replace his sackcloth ; but he didn 't receive it .
then Esther called for Hathach , one of the king 's eunuchs , whom he had appointed to attend her , and commanded him to go to Mordecai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
so Hathach went out to Mordecai , to city square which was before the king 's gate .
then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther , " Don 't think to yourself that you will escape in the king 's house any more than all the Jews .
Esther said , " If it seems good to the king , let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him . "
then the king said , " Bring Haman quickly , so that it may be done as Esther has said . " so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart , but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he didn 't stand up nor move for him , he was filled with wrath against Mordecai .
nevertheless Haman restrained himself , and went home . there , he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife .
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
on that night , the king couldn 't sleep . he commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought , and they were read to the king .
Mordecai came back to the king 's gate , but Haman hurried to his house , mourning and having his head covered .
while they were yet talking with him , the king 's eunuchs came , and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
then Esther the queen answered , " If I have found favor in your sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
so they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai . then was the king 's wrath pacified .
the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it to Mordecai . Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman .
then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter . so Esther arose , and stood before the king .
for how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people ? how can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by Courier on horseback , riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds .
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
so the couriers who rode on royal horses went out , hastened and pressed on by the king 's commandment . the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa .
for Mordecai was great in the king 's house , and his fame went out throughout all the provinces ; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater .
the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and with slaughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who hated them .
they killed Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
on that day , the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king .
the king commanded this to be done . a decree was given out in Shushan ; and they hanged Haman 's ten sons .
this was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar ; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
Mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus , both near and far ,
the Jews accepted the custom that they had begun , as Mordecai had written to them ;
then Esther the queen , the daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the Jew , wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim .
he sent letters to all the Jews , to the hundred twenty @-@ seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , with words of peace and truth ,
King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land , and on the islands of the sea .
his possessions also were seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred yoke of oxen , five hundred female donkeys , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east .
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
now it happened on the day when God 's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , that Satan also came among them .
Yahweh said to Satan , " Where have you come from ? " then Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . "
Yahweh said to Satan , " Have you considered my servant , Job ? for there is none like him in the earth , a blameless and an upright man , one who fears God , and turns away from evil . "
Yahweh said to Satan , " behold , all that he has is in your power . only on himself don 't put forth your hand . " so Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh .
it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
that there came a messenger to Job , and said , " The oxen were plowing , and the donkeys feeding beside them ,
and the Sabeans attacked , and took them away . yes , they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword , and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
then Job arose , and tore his robe , and shaved his head , and fell down on the ground , and worshiped .
again it happened on the day when the God 's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh .
so Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh , and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head .
so they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights , and none spoke a word to him , for they saw that his grief was very great .
" let the day perish in which I was born , the night which said , ' There is a boy conceived . '
let that day be darkness . Don 't let God from above seek for it , neither let the light shine on it .
let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own . let a cloud dwell on it . let all that makes black the day terrify it .
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of its twilight be dark . let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the eyelids of the morning ,
because it didn 't shut up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor did it hide trouble from my eyes .
" why didn 't I die from the womb ? why didn 't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me ?
why did the knees receive me ? or why the breast , that I should nurse ?
for now should I have lain down and been quiet . I should have slept , then I would have been at rest ,
or with princes who had gold , who filled their houses with silver :
there the prisoners are at ease together . they don 't hear the voice of the taskmaster .
" why is light given to him who is in misery , life to the bitter in soul ,
who long for death , but it doesn 't come ; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures ,
who rejoice exceedingly , and are glad , when they can find the grave ?
for the thing which I fear comes on me , That which I am afraid of comes to me .
I am not at ease , neither am I quiet , neither have I rest ; but trouble comes . "
" if someone ventures to talk with you , will you be grieved ? but who can withhold himself from speaking ?
your words have supported him who was falling , You have made firm the feeble knees .
but now it has come to you , and you faint . it touches you , and you are troubled .
according to what I have seen , those who plow iniquity , and sow trouble , reap the same .
by the breath of God they perish . by the blast of his anger are they consumed .
the roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , the teeth of the young lions , are broken .
the old lion perishes for lack of prey . the cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad .
then a spirit passed before my face . the hair of my flesh stood up .
it stood still , but I couldn 't discern its appearance . a form was before my eyes . silence , then I heard a voice , saying ,
how much more , those who dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , who are crushed before the moth !
Isn 't their tent cord plucked up within them ? they die , and that without wisdom . '
" call now ; is there any who will answer you ? to which of the holy ones will you turn ?
his children are far from safety . they are crushed in the gate . neither is there any to deliver them ,
for affliction doesn 't come forth from the dust , neither does trouble spring out of the ground ;
" but as for me , I would seek God . I would commit my cause to God ,
who gives rain on the earth , and sends waters on the fields ;
so that he sets up on high those who are low , those who mourn are exalted to safety .
he frustrates the devices of the crafty , So that their hands can 't perform their enterprise .
he takes the wise in their own craftiness ; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong .
they meet with darkness in the day time , and grope at noonday as in the night .
but he saves from the sword of their mouth , even the needy from the hand of the mighty .
in famine he will redeem you from death ; in war , from the power of the sword .
you shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue , neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes .
at destruction and famine you shall laugh , neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth .
for you shall be allied with the stones of the field . the animals of the field shall be at peace with you .
you shall know that your tent is in peace . you shall visit your fold , and shall miss nothing .
you shall know also that your seed shall be great , Your offspring as the grass of the earth .
you shall come to your grave in a full age , like a shock of grain comes in its season .
look this , we have searched it , so it is . hear it , and know it for your good . "
" Oh that my anguish were weighed , and all my calamity laid in the balances !
for now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas , therefore have my words been rash .
for the arrows of the Almighty are within me . my spirit drinks up their poison . the terrors of God set themselves in array against me .
does the wild donkey bray when he has grass ? or does the ox low over his fodder ?
can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt ? or is there any taste in the white of an egg ?
my soul refuses to touch them . they are as loathsome food to me .
" Oh that I might have my request , that God would grant the thing that I long for ,
even that it would please God to crush me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
be it still my consolation , yes , let me exult in pain that doesn 't spare , that I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
what is my strength , that I should wait ? what is my end , that I should be patient ?
Isn 't it that I have no help in me , That wisdom is driven quite from me ?
" to him who is ready to faint , kindness should be shown from his friend ; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty .
which are black by reason of the ice , in which the snow hides itself .
in the dry season , they vanish . when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
" teach me , and I will hold my peace . cause me to understand wherein I have erred .
how forcible are words of uprightness ! but your reproof , what does it reprove ?
do you intend to reprove words , since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind ?
yes , you would even cast lots for the fatherless , and make merchandise of your friend .
please return . let there be no injustice . yes , return again . my cause is righteous .
" Isn 't a man forced to labor on earth ? Aren 't his days like the days of a hired hand ?
as a servant who earnestly desires the shadow , as a hireling who looks for his wages ,
when I lie down , I say , ' When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? ' I Toss and turn until the dawning of the day .
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust . my skin closes up , and breaks out afresh .
my days are swifter than a weaver 's shuttle , and are spent without hope .
the eye of him who sees me shall see me no more . your eyes shall be on me , but I shall not be .
as the cloud is consumed and vanishes away , so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more .
he shall return no more to his house , neither shall his place know him any more .
" therefore I will not keep silent . I will speak in the anguish of my spirit . I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
when I say , ' My bed shall comfort me . my couch shall ease my complaint ; '
then you scare me with dreams , and terrify me through visions :
I loathe my life . I don 't want to live forever . leave me alone , for my days are but a breath .
what is man , that you should magnify him , that you should set your mind on him ,
how long will you not look away from me , nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle ?
why do you not pardon my disobedience , and take away my iniquity ? for now shall I lie down in the dust . you will seek me diligently , but I shall not be . "
" how long will you speak these things ? shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind ?
if your children have sinned against him , He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience .
if you were pure and upright , surely now he would awaken for you , and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous .
( for we are but of yesterday , and know nothing , because our days on earth are a shadow . )
shall they not teach you , tell you , and utter words out of their heart ?
while it is yet in its greenness , not cut down , it Withers before any other Reed .
so are the paths of all who forget God . the hope of the godless man shall perish ,
he shall lean on his house , but it shall not stand . he shall cling to it , but it shall not endure .
his roots are wrapped around the rock pile . he sees the place of stones .
if he is destroyed from his place , then it shall deny him , saying , ' I have not seen you . '
behold , this is the joy of his way : out of the earth , others shall spring .
" behold , God will not cast away a blameless man , neither will he uphold the evildoers .
those who hate you shall be clothed with shame . the tent of the wicked shall be no more . "
if he is pleased to contend with him , he can 't answer him one time in a thousand .
God who is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who has hardened himself against him , and prospered ?
he shakes the earth out of its place . its pillars tremble .
he commands the sun , and it doesn 't rise , and seals up the stars .
behold , he goes by me , and I don 't see him . he passes on also , but I don 't perceive him .
though I were righteous , yet I wouldn 't answer him . I would make supplication to my judge .
if I had called , and he had answered me , yet I wouldn 't believe that he listened to my voice .
for he breaks me with a storm , and multiplies my wounds without cause .
he will not allow me to catch my breath , but fills me with bitterness .
if it is a matter of strength , behold , he is mighty ! if of justice , ' Who , ' says he , ' will summon me ? '
though I am righteous , my own mouth shall condemn me . though I am blameless , it shall prove me perverse .
if the scourge kills suddenly , he will mock at the trial of the innocent .
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked . he covers the faces of its judges . if not he , then who is it ?
" now my days are swifter than a runner . they flee away , they see no good ,
they have passed away as the swift ships , as the eagle that swoops on the prey .
if I say , ' I will forget my complaint , I will put off my sad face , and cheer up ; '
I am afraid of all my sorrows , I know that you will not hold me innocent .
yet you will plunge me in the ditch . my own clothes shall abhor me .
for he is not a man , as I am , that I should answer him , that we should come together in judgment .
let him take his rod away from me . let his terror not make me afraid ;
" my soul is weary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
is it good to you that you should oppress , that you should despise the work of your hands , and smile on the counsel of the wicked ?
that you inquire after my iniquity , and search after my sin ?
although you know that I am not wicked , there is no one who can deliver out of your hand .
yet you hid these things in your heart . I know that this is with you :
if I sin , then you mark me . you will not acquit me from my iniquity .
if my head is held high , you hunt me like a lion . again you show yourself powerful to me .
you renew your witnesses against me , and increase your indignation on me . changes and warfare are with me .
" ' why , then , have you brought me forth out of the womb ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me .
I should have been as though I had not been . I should have been carried from the womb to the grave .
Aren 't my days few ? cease then . leave me alone , that I may find a little comfort ,
before I go where I shall not return from , to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death ;
the land dark as midnight , of the shadow of death , without any order , where the light is as midnight . ' "
should your boastings make men hold their peace ? when you mock , shall no man make you ashamed ?
that he would show you the secrets of wisdom ! for true wisdom has two sides . know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves .
they are high as heaven . what can you do ? they are deeper than Sheol . what can you know ?
its measure is longer than the earth , and broader than the sea .
for he knows false men . he sees iniquity also , even though he doesn 't consider it .
if iniquity is in your hand , put it far away . Don 't let unrighteousness dwell in your tents .
surely then you shall lift up your face without spot ; Yes , you shall be steadfast , and shall not fear :
for you shall forget your misery . you shall remember it as waters that are passed away .
life shall be clearer than the noonday . though there is darkness , it shall be as the morning .
you shall be secure , because there is hope . yes , you shall search , and shall take your rest in safety .
also you shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid . yes , many shall court your favor .
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail . they shall have no way to flee . their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit . "
but I have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to you . yes , who doesn 't know such things as these ?
I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor , I , who called on God , and he answered . the just , the blameless man is a joke .
in the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune . it is ready for them whose foot slips .
" but ask the animals , now , and they shall teach you ; the birds of the sky , and they shall tell you .
or speak to the earth , and it shall teach you . the fish of the sea shall declare to you .
who doesn 't know that in all these , the hand of Yahweh has done this ,
in whose hand is the life of every living thing , and the breath of all mankind ?
behold , he breaks down , and it can 't be built again . he imprisons a man , and there can be no release .
behold , he Withholds the waters , and they dry up . again , he sends them out , and they overturn the earth .
he removes the speech of those who are trusted , and takes away the understanding of the elders .
he uncovers deep things out of darkness , and brings out to light the shadow of death .
he increases the nations , and he destroys them . he enlarges the nations , and he leads them captive .
he takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth , and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way .
but you are forgers of lies . you are all physicians of no value .
is it good that he should search you out ? or as one deceives a man , will you deceive him ?
why should I take my flesh in my teeth , and put my life in my hand ?
see now , I have set my cause in order . I know that I am righteous .
who is he who will contend with me ? for then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit .
withdraw your hand far from me ; and don 't let your terror make me afraid .
you also put my feet in the stocks , and mark all my paths . you set a bound to the soles of my feet ,
" man , who is born of a woman , is of few days , and full of trouble .
he comes forth like a flower , and is cut down . he also flees like a shadow , and doesn 't continue .
do you open your eyes on such a one , and bring me into judgment with you ?
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months is with you , and you have appointed his bounds that he can 't pass ;
look away from him , that he may rest , until he shall accomplish , as a hireling , his day .
" for there is hope for a tree , If it is cut down , that it will sprout again , that the tender branch of it will not cease .
though its root grows old in the earth , and its stock dies in the ground ,
but man dies , and is laid low . yes , man gives up the spirit , and where is he ?
so man lies down and doesn 't rise . until the heavens are no more , they shall not awake , nor be roused out of their sleep .
" Oh that you would hide me in Sheol , that you would keep me secret , until your wrath is past , that you would appoint me a set time , and remember me !
if a man dies , shall he live again ? all the days of my warfare would I wait , until my release should come .
you would call , and I would answer you . you would have a desire to the work of your hands .
my disobedience is sealed up in a bag . you fasten up my iniquity .
" but the mountain falling comes to nothing . the rock is removed out of its place ;
the waters wear the stones . the torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth . so you destroy the hope of man .
you forever prevail against him , and he departs . you change his face , and send him away .
his sons come to honor , and he doesn 't know it . they are brought low , but he doesn 't perceive it of them .
should he reason with unprofitable talk , or with speeches with which he can do no good ?
for your iniquity teaches your mouth , and you choose the language of the crafty .
what do you know , that we don 't know ? what do you understand , which is not in us ?
with us are both the gray @-@ headed and the very aged men , much elder than your father .
are the consolations of God too small for you , even the word that is gentle toward you ?
that you turn your spirit against God , and let such words go out of your mouth ?
what is man , that he should be clean ? what is he who is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
behold , he puts no trust in his holy ones . yes , the heavens are not clean in his sight ;
how much less one who is abominable and corrupt , a man who drinks iniquity like water !
" I will show you , listen to me ; that which I have seen I will declare :
( which wise men have told by their fathers , and have not hidden it ;
the wicked man writhes in pain all his days , even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor .
a sound of terrors is in his ears . in prosperity the destroyer shall come on him .
he doesn 't believe that he shall return out of darkness . he is waited for by the sword .
he wanders abroad for bread , saying , ' Where is it ? ' he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
distress and anguish make him afraid . they prevail against him , as a king ready to the battle .
because he has stretched out his hand against God , and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty ;
he runs at him with a stiff neck , with the thick shields of his bucklers ;
because he has covered his face with his fatness , and gathered fat on his thighs .
he has lived in desolate cities , in houses which no one inhabited , which were ready to become heaps .
he shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue , neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth .
he shall not depart out of darkness . the flame shall dry up his branches . by the breath of God 's mouth shall he go away .
let him not trust in emptiness , deceiving himself ; for emptiness shall be his reward .
it shall be accomplished before his time . his branch shall not be green .
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree .
for the company of the godless shall be barren , and fire shall consume the tents of bribery .
I also could speak as you do . if your soul were in my soul 's place , I could join words together against you , and shake my head at you ,
but I would strengthen you with my mouth . the solace of my lips would relieve you .
" though I speak , my grief is not subsided . though I forbear , what am I eased ?
but now , God , you have surely worn me out . you have made desolate all my company .
you have shriveled me up . this is a witness against me . my leanness rises up against me . it testifies to my face .
he has torn me in his wrath , and persecuted me . he has gnashed on me with his teeth . my adversary sharpens his eyes on me .
they have gaped on me with their mouth . they have struck me on the cheek reproachfully . they gather themselves together against me .
God delivers me to the ungodly , and casts me into the hands of the wicked .
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the neck , and dashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .
his archers surround me . he splits my kidneys apart , and does not spare . he pours out my gall on the ground .
my face is red with weeping . deep darkness is on my eyelids .
" Earth , don 't cover my blood . let my cry have no place to rest .
even now , behold , my witness is in heaven . he who vouches for me is on high .
that he would maintain the right of a man with God , of a son of man with his neighbor !
" my spirit is consumed . my days are extinct , And the grave is ready for me .
" now give a pledge , be collateral for me with yourself . who is there who will strike hands with me ?
he who Denounces his friends for a prey , Even the eyes of his children shall fail .
" but he has made me a byword of the people . they spit in my face .
my eye also is dim by reason of sorrow . all my members are as a shadow .
upright men shall be astonished at this . the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless .
yet shall the righteous hold on his way . he who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger .
my days are past , my plans are broken off , as are the thoughts of my heart .
they change the night into day , saying ' The light is near ' in the presence of darkness .
if I look for Sheol as my house , if I have spread my couch in the darkness ,
if I have said to corruption , ' You are my father ; ' to the worm , ' My mother , ' and ' my sister ; '
where then is my hope ? as for my hope , who shall see it ?
shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol , or descend together into the dust ? "
why are we counted as animals , which have become unclean in your sight ?
you who tear yourself in your anger , shall the earth be forsaken for you ? or shall the rock be removed out of its place ?
" yes , the light of the wicked shall be put out , The spark of his fire shall not shine .
the light shall be dark in his tent . his lamp above him shall be put out .
the steps of his strength shall be shortened . his own counsel shall cast him down .
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he wanders into its mesh .
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side , and shall chase him at his heels .
the members of his body shall be devoured . the firstborn of death shall devour his members .
he shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts . he shall be brought to the king of terrors .
there shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his . sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation .
his roots shall be dried up beneath . above shall his branch be cut off .
his memory shall perish from the earth . he shall have no name in the street .
he shall be driven from light into darkness , and chased out of the world .
those who come after shall be astonished at his day , as those who went before were frightened .
you have reproached me ten times . you aren 't ashamed that you attack me .
if it is true that I have erred , my error remains with myself .
he has walled up my way so that I can 't pass , and has set darkness in my paths .
he has stripped me of my glory , and taken the crown from my head .
he has broken me down on every side , and I am gone . my hope he has plucked up like a tree .
" he has put my brothers far from me . my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me .
those who dwell in my house , and my maids , count me for a stranger . I am an alien in their sight .
I call to my servant , and he gives me no answer . I beg him with my mouth .
my breath is offensive to my wife . I am loathsome to the children of my own mother .
my bones stick to my skin and to my flesh . I have escaped by the skin of my teeth .
" have pity on me , have pity on me , you my friends ; for the hand of God has touched me .
" Oh that my words were now written ! Oh that they were inscribed in a book !
but as for me , I know that my Redeemer lives . in the end , he will stand upon the earth .
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a stranger . " my heart is consumed within me .
if you say , ' How we will persecute him ! ' because the root of the matter is found in me ,
be afraid of the sword , for wrath brings the punishments of the sword , that you may know there is a judgment . "
" therefore do my thoughts give answer to me , even by reason of my haste that is in me .
I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame . the spirit of my understanding answers me .
that the triumphing of the wicked is short , the joy of the godless but for a moment ?
though his height mount up to the heavens , and his head reach to the clouds ,
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found . yes , he shall be chased away like a vision of the night .
the eye which saw him shall see him no more , neither shall his place any more see him .
his children shall seek the favor of the poor . his hands shall give back his wealth .
his bones are full of his youth , but youth shall lie down with him in the dust .
though he spare it , and will not let it go , but keep it still within his mouth ;
he has swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again . God will cast them out of his belly .
he shall not look at the rivers , the flowing streams of honey and butter .
that for which he labored he shall restore , and shall not swallow it down . according to the substance that he has gotten , he shall not rejoice .
for he has oppressed and forsaken the poor . he has violently taken away a house , and he shall not build it up .
" because he knew no quietness within him , he shall not save anything of that in which he delights .
there was nothing left that he didn 't devour , therefore his prosperity shall not endure .
in the fullness of his sufficiency , distress shall overtake him . the hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him .
when he is about to fill his belly , God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him . it will rain on him while he is eating .
he draws it forth , and it comes out of his body . yes , the glittering point comes out of his liver . Terrors are on him .
all darkness is laid up for his treasures . an unfanned fire shall devour him . it shall consume that which is left in his tent .
the increase of his house shall depart . they shall rush away in the day of his wrath .
as for me , is my complaint to man ? why shouldn 't I be impatient ?
look at me , and be astonished . lay your hand on your mouth .
" why do the wicked live , become old , yes , and grow mighty in power ?
their child is established with them in their sight , their offspring before their eyes .
they send forth their little ones like a flock . their children dance .
behold , their prosperity is not in their hand . the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
" how often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out , that their calamity comes on them , that God distributes sorrows in his anger ?
how often is it that they are as stubble before the wind , as chaff that the storm carries away ?
you say , ' God lays up his iniquity for his children . ' let him recompense it to himself , that he may know it .
let his own eyes see his destruction . let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty .
for what does he care for his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off ?
his pails are full of milk . the marrow of his bones is moistened .
for you say , ' Where is the house of the prince ? where is the tent in which the wicked lived ? '
that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity , That they are led forth to the day of wrath ?
yet he will be borne to the grave . men shall keep watch over the tomb .
the clods of the valley shall be sweet to him . all men shall draw after him , as there were innumerable before him .
is it any pleasure to the Almighty , that you are righteous ? or does it benefit him , that you make your ways perfect ?
is it for your piety that he reproves you , that he enters with you into judgment ?
Isn 't your wickedness great ? neither is there any end to your iniquities .
for you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing , and stripped the naked of their clothing .
you haven 't given water to the weary to drink , and you have withheld bread from the hungry .
but as for the mighty man , he had the earth . the honorable man , he lived in it .
you have sent widows away empty , and the arms of the fatherless have been broken .
" Isn 't God in the heights of heaven ? see the height of the stars , how high they are !
thick clouds are a covering to him , so that he doesn 't see . he walks on the vault of the sky . '
will you keep the old way , which wicked men have trodden ,
saying , ' surely those who rose up against us are cut off . the fire has consumed their remnant . '
" acquaint yourself with him , now , and be at peace . thereby good shall come to you .
please receive instruction from his mouth , and lay up his words in your heart .
if you return to the Almighty , you shall be built up , if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents .
lay your treasure in the dust , the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks .
you shall make your prayer to him , and he will hear you . you shall pay your vows .
you shall also decree a thing , and it shall be established to you . light shall shine on your ways .
when they cast down , you shall say , ' be lifted up . ' he will save the humble person .
he will even deliver him who is not innocent . yes , he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands . "
Oh that I knew where I might find him ! that I might come even to his seat !
I would set my cause in order before him , and fill my mouth with arguments .
I would know the words which he would answer me , and understand what he would tell me .
would he contend with me in the greatness of his power ? no , but he would listen to me .
" if I go east , he is not there ; if west , I can 't find him ;
he works to the north , but I can 't see him . he turns south , but I can 't catch a glimpse of him .
but he knows the way that I take . when he has tried me , I shall come forth like gold .
my foot has held fast to his steps . I have kept his way , and not turned aside .
I haven 't gone back from the commandment of his lips . I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food .
for he performs that which is appointed for me . many such things are with him .
therefore I am terrified at his presence . when I consider , I am afraid of him .
because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face .
there are people who remove the landmarks . they violently take away flocks , and feed them .
they drive away the donkey of the fatherless , and they take the widow 's ox for a pledge .
they turn the needy out of the way . the poor of the earth all hide themselves .
behold , as wild donkeys in the desert , they go forth to their work , seeking diligently for food . the wilderness yields them bread for their children .
they cut their provender in the field . they glean the vineyard of the wicked .
they are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter .
there are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge of the poor ,
so that they go around naked without clothing . being hungry , they carry the sheaves .
they make oil within the walls of these men . they tread wine presses , and suffer thirst .
from out of the populous city , men groan . the soul of the wounded cries out , yet God doesn 't regard the Folly .
" these are of those who rebel against the light . they don 't know its ways , nor stay in its paths .
the murderer rises with the light . he kills the poor and needy . in the night he is like a thief .
the eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight , saying , ' No eye shall see me . ' he disguises his face .
in the dark they dig through houses . they shut themselves up in the daytime . they don 't know the light .
for the morning is to all of them like thick darkness , for they know the terrors of the thick darkness .
" they are foam on the surface of the waters . their portion is Cursed in the earth . they don 't turn into the way of the vineyards .
the womb shall forget him . the worm shall feed sweetly on him . he shall be no more remembered . Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree .
how then can man be just with God ? or how can he who is born of a woman be clean ?
behold , even the moon has no brightness , and the stars are not pure in his sight ;
" how have you helped him who is without power ! how have you saved the arm that has no strength !
" those who are deceased tremble , those beneath the waters and all that live in them .
he binds up the waters in his thick clouds , and the cloud is not burst under them .
he encloses the face of his throne , and spreads his cloud on it .
he has described a boundary on the surface of the waters , and to the confines of light and darkness .
behold , these are but the outskirts of his ways . how small a whisper do we hear of him ! but the Thunder of his power who can understand ? "
( for the length of my life is still in me , and the spirit of God is in my nostrils ) ;
far be it from me that I should justify you . until I die I will not put away my integrity from me .
I hold fast to my righteousness , and will not let it go . my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live .
" let my enemy be as the wicked . let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous .
for what is the hope of the godless , when he is cut off , when God takes away his life ?
I will teach you about the hand of God . that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal .
" this is the portion of a wicked man with God , the heritage of oppressors , which they receive from the Almighty .
if his children are multiplied , it is for the sword . his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread .
those who remain of him shall be buried in death . his widows shall make no lamentation .
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
he lies down rich , but he shall not do so again . he opens his eyes , and he is not .
the east wind carries him away , and he departs . it sweeps him out of his place .
for it hurls at him , and does not spare , as he flees away from his hand .
iron is taken out of the earth , and copper is smelted out of the ore .
man sets an end to darkness , and searches out , to the furthest bound , the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness .
he breaks open a Shaft away from where people live . they are forgotten by the foot . they hang far from men , they swing back and forth .
as for the earth , out of it comes bread ; underneath it is turned up as it were by fire .
that path no bird of prey knows , neither has the falcon 's eye seen it .
the proud animals have not trodden it , nor has the fierce lion passed by there .
he puts forth his hand on the flinty rock , and he overturns the mountains by the roots .
he binds the streams that they don 't trickle . the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light .
" but where shall wisdom be found ? where is the place of understanding ?
man doesn 't know its price ; Neither is it found in the land of the living .
it can 't be gotten for gold , neither shall silver be weighed for its price .
it can 't be valued with the gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire .
gold and glass can 't equal it , neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold .
no mention shall be made of coral or of crystal . yes , the price of wisdom is above rubies .
seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living , and kept close from the birds of the sky .
he establishes the force of the wind . yes , he measures out the waters by measure .
when he made a decree for the rain , and a way for the lightning of the Thunder ;
then he saw it , and declared it . he established it , yes , and searched it out .
" Oh that I were as in the months of old , as in the days when God watched over me ;
when his lamp shone on my head , and by his light I walked through darkness ,
as I was in the ripeness of my days , when the friendship of God was in my tent ,
when my steps were washed with butter , and the rock poured out streams of oil for me ,
when I went forth to the city gate , when I prepared my seat in the street .
the young men saw me and hid themselves . the aged rose up and stood .
the princes refrained from talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
the voice of the nobles was hushed , and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth .
for when the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw me , it commended me :
because I delivered the poor who cried , and the fatherless also , who had none to help him ,
the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me , and I caused the widow 's heart to sing for joy .
I put on righteousness , and it clothed me . my justice was as a robe and a diadem .
I was eyes to the blind , and feet to the lame .
I was a father to the needy . the cause of him who I didn 't know , I searched out .
I broke the jaws of the unrighteous , and plucked the prey out of his teeth .
my root is spread out to the waters . the dew lies all night on my branch .
my glory is fresh in me . my bow is renewed in my hand . '
they waited for me as for the rain . their mouths drank as with the spring rain .
I smiled on them when they had no confidence . they didn 't reject the light of my face .
I chose out their way , and sat as chief . I lived as a king in the army , as one who comforts the mourners .
of what use is the strength of their hands to me , men in whom ripe age has perished ?
they are gaunt from lack and famine . they gnaw the dry ground , in the gloom of waste and desolation .
they pluck salt herbs by the bushes . the roots of the Broom are their food .
they are driven out from the midst of men . they cry after them as after a thief ;
so that they dwell in frightful valleys , and in holes of the earth and of the rocks .
among the bushes they bray ; and under the nettles they are gathered together .
they are children of fools , yes , children of base men . they were flogged out of the land .
" now I have become their song . yes , I am a byword to them .
they abhor me , they stand aloof from me , and don 't hesitate to spit in my face .
for he has untied his cord , and afflicted me ; and they have thrown off restraint before me .
on my right hand rise the rabble . they thrust aside my feet , They cast up against me their ways of destruction .
as through a wide breach they come , in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in .
Terrors have turned on me . they chase my honor as the wind . my welfare has passed away as a cloud .
" now my soul is poured out within me . days of affliction have taken hold on me .
in the night season my bones are pierced in me , and the pains that gnaw me take no rest .
by great force is my garment disfigured . it binds me about as the collar of my coat .
he has cast me into the mire . I have become like dust and ashes .
I cry to you , and you do not answer me . I stand up , and you gaze at me .
you have turned to be cruel to me . with the might of your hand you persecute me .
you lift me up to the wind , and drive me with it . you dissolve me in the storm .
for I know that you will bring me to death , To the house appointed for all living .
" however doesn 't one stretch out a hand in his fall ? or in his calamity therefore cry for help ?
Didn 't I weep for him who was in trouble ? Wasn 't my soul grieved for the needy ?
when I looked for good , then evil came ; When I waited for light , there came darkness .
my heart is troubled , and doesn 't rest . days of affliction have come on me .
I go mourning without the sun . I stand up in the assembly , and cry for help .
I am a brother to jackals , and a companion to ostriches .
my skin grows black and peels from me . my bones are burned with heat .
therefore my harp has turned to mourning , and my pipe into the voice of those who weep .
" I made a Covenant with my eyes , how then should I look lustfully at a young woman ?
( let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may know my integrity ) ;
if my step has turned out of the way , if my heart walked after my eyes , if any defilement has stuck to my hands ,
then let me sow , and let another eat . yes , let the produce of my field be rooted out .
" if my heart has been enticed to a woman , and I have laid wait at my neighbor 's door ,
for that would be a heinous crime . yes , it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges :
" if I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant , when they contended with me ;
what then shall I do when God rises up ? when he visits , what shall I answer him ?
" if I have withheld the poor from their desire , or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail ,
or have eaten my morsel alone , and the fatherless has not eaten of it
( no , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , her have I guided from my mother 's womb ) ;
if his heart hasn 't blessed me , if he hasn 't been warmed with my sheep 's Fleece ;
if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless , because I saw my help in the gate ,
then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade , and my arm be broken from the bone .
" if I have made gold my hope , and have said to the fine gold , ' You are my confidence ; '
if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great , and because my hand had gotten much ;
if I have seen the sun when it shined , or the moon moving in splendor ,
and my heart has been secretly enticed , and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth ,
this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges ; for I should have denied the God who is above .
" if I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him ;
( yes , I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse ) ;
if the men of my tent have not said , ' Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat ? '
( the foreigner has not lodged in the street , but I have opened my doors to the Traveler ) ;
surely I would carry it on my shoulder ; and I would bind it to me as a crown .
I would declare to him the number of my steps. as a prince would I go near to him .
if I have eaten its fruits without money , or have caused its owners to lose their life ,
then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel , the Buzite , of the family of Ram , was kindled against Job . his wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God .
also his wrath was kindled against his three friends , because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned Job .
Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered , " I am young , and you are very old ; Therefore I held back , and didn 't dare show you my opinion .
but there is a spirit in man , and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding .
it is not the great who are wise , nor the aged who understand justice .
" behold , I waited for your words , and I listened for your reasoning , while you searched out what to say .
yes , I gave you my full attention , but there was no one who convinced Job , or who answered his words , among you .
shall I wait , because they don 't speak , because they stand still , and answer no more ?
behold , my breast is as wine which has no vent ; like new wineskins it is ready to burst .
I will speak , that I may be refreshed . I will open my lips and answer .
please don 't let me respect any man 's person , neither will I give flattering titles to any man .
for I don 't know how to give flattering titles ; or else my Maker would soon take me away .
see now , I have opened my mouth . my tongue has spoken in my mouth .
my words shall utter the uprightness of my heart . that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely .
if you can , answer me . set your words in order before me , and stand forth .
behold , I am toward God even as you are . I am also formed out of the clay .
behold , my terror shall not make you afraid , neither shall my pressure be heavy on you .
" surely you have spoken in my hearing , I have heard the voice of your words , saying ,
'i am clean , without disobedience . I am innocent , neither is there iniquity in me .
he puts my feet in the stocks . he marks all my paths . '
" behold , I will answer you . in this you are not just , for God is greater than man .
why do you strive against him , because he doesn 't give account of any of his matters ?
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falls on men , in slumbering on the bed ;
then he opens the ears of men , and seals their instruction ,
that he may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man .
he keeps back his soul from the pit , and his life from perishing by the sword .
he is chastened also with pain on his bed , with continual strife in his bones ;
his flesh is so consumed away , that it can 't be seen . his bones that were not seen stick out .
yes , his soul draws near to the pit , and his life to the destroyers .
" if there is beside him an angel , an interpreter , one among a thousand , to show to man what is right for him ;
then God is gracious to him , and says , ' Deliver him from going down to the pit , I have found a ransom . '
his flesh shall be fresher than a child 's . he returns to the days of his youth .
he prays to God , and he is favorable to him , so that he sees his face with joy . he restores to man his righteousness .
he sings before men , and says , ' I have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it didn 't profit me .
he has redeemed my soul from going into the pit . my life shall see the light . '
" behold , God works all these things , twice , yes three times , with a man ,
if you have anything to say , answer me . speak , for I desire to justify you .
if not , listen to me . hold your peace , and I will teach you wisdom . "
let us choose for us that which is right . let us know among ourselves what is good .
notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar . my wound is incurable , though I am without disobedience . '
" therefore listen to me , you men of understanding : far be it from God , that he should do wickedness , from the Almighty , that he should commit iniquity .
for the work of a man he will render to him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
who put him in charge of the earth ? or who has appointed him over the whole world ?
if he set his heart on himself , If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath ,
" if now you have understanding , hear this . listen to the voice of my words .
who doesn 't respect the persons of princes , nor respects the rich more than the poor ; for they all are the work of his hands .
in a moment they die , even at midnight . the people are shaken and pass away . the mighty are taken away without a hand .
for he doesn 't need to consider a man further , that he should go before God in judgment .
he breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out , and sets others in their place .
therefore he takes knowledge of their works . he overturns them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
because they turned aside from following him , and wouldn 't pay attention to any of his ways ,
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him . he heard the cry of the afflicted .
when he gives quietness , who then can condemn ? when he hides his face , who then can see him ? alike whether to a nation , or to a man ,
that the godless man may not reign , that there be no one to ensnare the people .
" for has any said to God , ' I am guilty , but I will not offend any more .
teach me that which I don 't see . if I have done iniquity , I will do it no more ' ?
I wish that Job were tried to the end , because of his answering like wicked men .
" do you think this to be your right , or do you say , ' My righteousness is more than God 's , '
that you ask , ' What advantage will it be to you ? what profit shall I have , more than if I had sinned ? '
look to the heavens , and see . see the skies , which are higher than you .
if you have sinned , what effect do you have against him ? if your transgressions are multiplied , what do you do to him ?
if you are righteous , what do you give him ? or what does he receive from your hand ?
your wickedness may hurt a man as you are , and your righteousness may profit a son of man .
" by reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out . they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty .
who teaches us more than the animals of the earth , and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky ? '
how much less when you say you don 't see him . the cause is before him , and you wait for him !
but now , because he has not visited in his anger , neither does he greatly regard arrogance .
" bear with me a little , and I will show you ; for I still have something to say on God 's behalf .
" behold , God is mighty , and doesn 't despise anyone . he is mighty in strength of understanding .
he doesn 't preserve the life of the wicked , but gives to the afflicted their right .
he doesn 't withdraw his eyes from the righteous , but with kings on the throne , he sets them forever , and they are exalted .
if they are bound in fetters , and are taken in the cords of afflictions ,
then he shows them their work , and their transgressions , that they have behaved themselves proudly .
he also opens their ears to instruction , and commands that they return from iniquity .
but if they don 't listen , they shall perish by the sword ; they shall die without knowledge .
" but those who are godless in heart lay up anger . they don 't cry for help when he binds them .
yes , he would have allured you out of distress , into a broad place , where there is no restriction . that which is set on your table would be full of fatness .
" but you are full of the judgment of the wicked . judgment and justice take hold of you .
Don 't let riches entice you to wrath , neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside .
Don 't desire the night , when people are cut off in their place .
behold , God is great , and we don 't know him . the number of his years is unsearchable .
for he draws up the drops of water , which distill in rain from his vapor ,
yes , can any understand the spreading of the clouds , and the thunderings of his pavilion ?
he covers his hands with the lightning , and commands it to strike the mark .
" yes , at this my heart trembles , and is moved out of its place .
hear , oh , hear the noise of his voice , the sound that goes out of his mouth .
he sends it forth under the whole sky , and his lightning to the ends of the earth .
after it a voice roars . he thunders with the voice of his majesty . he doesn 't hold back anything when his voice is heard .
for he says to the snow , ' Fall on the earth ; ' likewise to the shower of rain , and to the showers of his mighty rain .
he seals up the hand of every man , that all men whom he has made may know it .
out of its room comes the storm , and cold out of the north .
by the breath of God , ice is given , and the breadth of the waters is frozen .
yes , he loads the thick cloud with moisture . he spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning .
it is turned around by his guidance , that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world ,
whether it is for correction , or for his land , or for loving kindness , that he causes it to come .
do you know how God controls them , and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine ?
do you know the workings of the clouds , the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge ?
you whose clothing is warm , when the earth is still by reason of the south wind ?
can you , with him , spread out the sky , which is strong as a cast metal mirror ?
shall it be told him that I would speak ? or should a man wish that he were swallowed up ?
now men don 't see the light which is bright in the skies , but the wind passes , and clears them .
we can 't reach the Almighty . he is exalted in power . in justice and great righteousness , he will not oppress .
" where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth ? declare , if you have understanding .
and said , ' Here you may come , but no further . here your proud waves shall be stayed ? '
that it might take hold of the ends of the earth , and shake the wicked out of it ?
from the wicked , their light is withheld . the high arm is broken .
" have you entered into the springs of the sea ? or have you walked in the recesses of the deep ?
have the gates of death been revealed to you ? or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death ?
that you should take it to its bound , that you should discern the paths to its house ?
who has cut a channel for the flood water , or the path for the thunderstorm ;
to cause it to rain on a land where no man is ; on the wilderness , in which there is no man ;
to satisfy the waste and desolate ground , to cause the tender grass to spring forth ?
out of whose womb came the ice ? the gray Frost of the sky , who has given birth to it ?
the waters become hard like stone , when the surface of the deep is frozen .
can you lead forth the constellations in their season ? or can you guide the Bear with her cubs ?
do you know the laws of the heavens ? can you establish its dominion over the earth ?
" can you lift up your voice to the clouds , That abundance of waters may cover you ?
can you send forth lightnings , that they may go ? do they report to you , ' Here we are ? '
who has put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who has given understanding to the mind ?
who can number the clouds by wisdom ? or who can pour out the bottles of the sky ,
when the dust runs into a mass , and the clods of earth stick together ?
when they crouch in their dens , and lie in wait in the thicket ?
who provides for the raven his prey , when his young ones cry to God , and wander for lack of food ?
can you number the months that they fulfill ? or do you know the time when they give birth ?
they bow themselves , they bring forth their young , they end their labor pains .
their young ones become strong . they grow up in the open field . they go forth , and don 't return again .
" who has set the wild donkey free ? or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey ,
whose home I have made the wilderness , and the salt land his dwelling place ?
he scorns the tumult of the city , neither does he hear the shouting of the driver .
the range of the mountains is his pasture , He searches after every green thing .
will you confide in him , that he will bring home your seed , and gather the grain of your threshing floor ?
and forgets that the foot may crush them , or that the wild animal may trample them .
she deals harshly with her young ones , as if they were not hers . though her labor is in vain , she is without fear ,
when she lifts up herself on high , she scorns the horse and his Rider .
he paws in the valley , and rejoices in his strength . he goes out to meet the armed men .
he eats up the ground with fierceness and rage , neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet .
as often as the trumpet sounds he snorts , ' Aha ! ' he smells the battle afar off , the Thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
" is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars , and stretches her wings toward the south ?
is it at your command that the eagle mounts up , and makes his nest on high ?
on the cliff he dwells , and makes his home , on the point of the cliff , and the stronghold .
from there he spies out the prey . his eyes see it afar off .
" behold , I am of small account . what shall I answer you ? I lay my hand on my mouth .
I have spoken once , and I will not answer ; Yes , twice , but I will proceed no further . "
pour out the fury of your anger . look at everyone who is proud , and bring him low .
look at everyone who is proud , and humble him . crush the wicked in their place .
" see now , behemoth , which I made as well as you . he eats grass as an ox .
look now , his strength is in his thighs . his force is in the muscles of his belly .
he moves his tail like a cedar . the sinews of his thighs are knit together .
his bones are like tubes of brass . his limbs are like bars of iron .
he is the chief of the ways of God . he who made him gives him his sword .
surely the mountains produce food for him , where all the animals of the field play .
he lies under the lotus trees , in the covert of the Reed , and the marsh .
the lotuses cover him with their shade . the willows of the Brook surround him .
behold , if a river overflows , he doesn 't tremble . he is confident , though the Jordan swells even to his mouth .
shall any take him when he is on the watch , or Pierce through his nose with a snare ?
" can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook , or press down his tongue with a cord ?
can you put a rope into his nose , or Pierce his jaw through with a hook ?
will he make many petitions to you , or will he speak soft words to you ?
will he make a Covenant with you , that you should take him for a servant forever ?
can you fill his skin with barbed irons , or his head with fish spears ?
behold , the hope of him is in vain . won 't one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
none is so fierce that he dare stir him up . who then is he who can stand before me ?
who has first given to me , that I should repay him ? everything under the heavens is mine .
they are joined one to another . they stick together , so that they can 't be pulled apart .
his sneezing flashes out light . his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning .
out of his mouth go burning torches . sparks of fire leap forth .
out of his nostrils a smoke goes , as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds .
the flakes of his flesh are joined together . they are firm on him . they can 't be moved .
if one attacks him with the sword , it can 't prevail ; nor the spear , the dart , nor the pointed Shaft .
his undersides are like sharp potsherds , leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge .
he makes the deep to boil like a pot . he makes the sea like a pot of ointment .
" I know that you can do all things , and that no purpose of yours can be restrained .
you asked , ' Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge ? ' therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand , things too wonderful for me , which I didn 't know .
you said , ' listen , now , and I will speak ; I will question you , and you will answer me . '
I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear , but now my eye sees you .
so Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went , and did what Yahweh commanded them , and Yahweh accepted Job .
Yahweh turned the captivity of Job , when he prayed for his friends . Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before .
so Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning . he had fourteen thousand sheep , six thousand camels , one thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand female donkeys .
after this Job lived one hundred forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , to four generations .
so Job died , being old and full of days .
blessed is the man who doesn 't walk in the counsel of the wicked , nor stand in the way of sinners , nor sit in the seat of scoffers ;
he will be like a tree planted by the streams of water , that brings forth its fruit in its season , whose leaf also does not wither . whatever he does shall prosper .
the wicked are not so , but are like the chaff which the wind drives away .
therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment , nor sinners in the Congregation of the righteous .
for Yahweh knows the way of the righteous , but the way of the wicked shall perish .
the kings of the earth take a stand , and the rulers take counsel together , against Yahweh , and against his Anointed , saying ,
he who sits in the heavens will laugh . the Lord will have them in derision .
then he will speak to them in his anger , and terrify them in his wrath :
ask of me , and I will give the nations for your inheritance , the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession .
you shall break them with a rod of iron . you shall dash them in pieces like a Potter 's vessel . "
give sincere Homage to the Son , lest he be angry , and you perish in the way , for his wrath will soon be kindled . blessed are all those who take refuge in him .
< < A Psalm by David , when he fled from Absalom his son . > > Yahweh , how my adversaries have increased ! many are those who rise up against me .
but you , Yahweh , are a shield around me , my glory , and the one who lifts up my head .
I cry to Yahweh with my voice , and he answers me out of his holy hill . Selah .
I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side .
arise , Yahweh ! save me , my God ! for you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone . you have broken the teeth of the wicked .
but know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly : Yahweh will hear when I call to him .
stand in awe , and don 't sin . search your own heart on your bed , and be still . Selah .
in peace I will both lay myself down and sleep , for you , Yahweh alone , make me live in safety .
< < For the Chief Musician , with the flutes . a Psalm by David . > > Give ear to my words , Yahweh . consider my meditation .
listen to the voice of my cry , my King and my God ; for to you do I pray .
Yahweh , in the morning you shall hear my voice . in the morning I will lay my requests before you , and will watch expectantly .
for you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness . evil can 't live with you .
the arrogant shall not stand in your sight . you hate all workers of iniquity .
but as for me , in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house . I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you .
lead me , Yahweh , in your righteousness because of my enemies . make your way straight before my face .
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth . their heart is destruction . their throat is an open tomb . they flatter with their tongue .
hold them guilty , God . let them fall by their own counsels ; thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions , for they have rebelled against you .
but let all those who take refuge in you rejoice , Let them always shout for joy , because you defend them . let them also who love your name be joyful in you .
< < For the Chief Musician ; on stringed instruments , upon the eight @-@ stringed Lyre . a Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , don 't rebuke me in your anger , neither discipline me in your wrath .
I am weary with my groaning . every night I flood my bed . I drench my couch with my tears .
my eye wastes away because of grief . it grows old because of all my adversaries .
depart from me , all you workers of iniquity , for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping .
May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed . they shall turn back , they shall be disgraced suddenly .
lest they tear apart my soul like a lion , ripping it in pieces , while there is none to deliver .
Yahweh , my God , if I have done this , if there is iniquity in my hands ,
if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me ( yes , if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary ) ,
let the enemy pursue my soul , and overtake it ; yes , let him tread my life down to the earth , and lay my glory in the dust . Selah .
arise , Yahweh , in your anger . lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries . awake for me . you have commanded judgment .
Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples . judge me , Yahweh , according to my righteousness , and to my integrity that is in me .
Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end , but establish the righteous ; their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God .
if a man doesn 't relent , he will sharpen his sword ; he has bent and strung his bow .
he has also prepared for himself the instruments of death . he makes ready his flaming arrows .
the trouble he causes shall return to his own head . his violence shall come down on the crown of his own head .
from the lips of Babes and infants you have established strength , because of your adversaries , that you might silence the enemy and the avenger .
when I consider your heavens , the work of your fingers , the moon and the stars , which you have ordained ;
you make him ruler over the works of your hands . you have put all things under his feet :
all sheep and cattle , yes , and the animals of the field ,
the birds of the sky , the fish of the sea , and whatever passes through the paths of the seas .
< < For the Chief Musician . set to " The Death of the Son . " a Psalm by David . > > I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart . I will tell of all your marvelous works .
I will be glad and rejoice in you . I will sing praise to your name , O Most High .
you have rebuked the nations . you have destroyed the wicked . you have blotted out their name forever and ever .
he will judge the world in righteousness . he will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness .
Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed ; a high tower in times of trouble .
those who know your name will put their trust in you , for you , Yahweh , have not forsaken those who seek you .
sing praises to Yahweh , who dwells in Zion , and declare among the people what he has done .
for he who avenges blood remembers them . he doesn 't forget the cry of the afflicted .
that I may show forth all your praise . in the gates of the daughter of Zion , I will rejoice in your salvation .
the nations have sunk down in the pit that they made . in the net which they hid , their own foot is taken .
Yahweh has made himself known . he has executed judgment . the wicked is snared by the work of his own hands . Meditation . Selah .
the wicked shall be turned back to Sheol , even all the nations that forget God .
for the needy shall not always be forgotten , nor the hope of the poor perish forever .
arise , Yahweh ! Don 't let man prevail . let the nations be judged in your sight .
why do you stand far off , Yahweh ? why do you hide yourself in times of trouble ?
in arrogance , the wicked hunt down the weak . they are caught in the schemes that they devise .
his ways are prosperous at all times . he is haughty , and your laws are far from his sight . as for all his adversaries , he sneers at them .
he lies in wait near the villages . from ambushes , he murders the innocent . his eyes are secretly set against the helpless .
he lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush . he lies in wait to catch the helpless . he catches the helpless , when he draws him in his net .
why does the wicked person condemn God , and say in his heart , " God won 't call me into account ? "
break the arm of the wicked . as for the evil man , seek out his wickedness until you find none .
Yahweh , you have heard the desire of the humble . you will prepare their heart . you will cause your ear to hear ,
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed , that man who is of the earth may terrify no more .
< < For the Chief Musician . by David . > > In Yahweh , I take refuge . how can you say to my soul , " flee as a bird to your mountain ! "
for , behold , the wicked bend their bows . they set their arrows on the strings , that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart .
Yahweh is in his holy temple . Yahweh is on his throne in heaven . his eyes observe . his eyes examine the children of men .
on the wicked he will rain blazing coals ; fire , sulfur , and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup .
everyone lies to his neighbor . they speak with flattering lips , and with a double heart .
May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips , and the tongue that boasts ,
the wicked walk on every side , when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > How long , Yahweh ? will you forget me forever ? how long will you hide your face from me ?
how long shall I take counsel in my soul , having sorrow in my heart every day ? how long shall my enemy triumph over me ?
behold , and answer me , Yahweh , my God . give light to my eyes , lest I sleep in death ;
Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men , to see if there were any who understood , who sought after God .
they have all gone aside . they have together become corrupt . there is none who does good , no , not one .
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge , who eat up my people as they eat bread , and don 't call on Yahweh ?
there they were in great fear , for God is in the generation of the righteous .
Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! when Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people , then Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , who shall dwell in your sanctuary ? who shall live on your holy hill ?
he who doesn 't slander with his tongue , nor does evil to his friend , nor casts slurs against his fellow man ;
in whose eyes a vile man is despised , but who honors those who fear Yahweh ; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts , and doesn 't change ;
he who doesn 't lend out his money for usury , nor take a bribe against the innocent . he who does these things shall never be shaken .
< < A Poem by David . > > Preserve me , God , for in you do I take refuge .
my soul , you have said to Yahweh , " You are my Lord . apart from you I have no good thing . "
as for the saints who are in the earth , they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight .
their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god . their drink offerings of blood I will not offer , nor take their names on my lips .
the lines have fallen to me in pleasant places . yes , I have a good inheritance .
I will bless Yahweh , who has given me counsel . yes , my heart instructs me in the night seasons .
I have set Yahweh always before me . because he is at my right hand , I shall not be moved .
you will show me the path of life . in your presence is fullness of joy . in your right hand there are pleasures forevermore .
< < A Prayer by David . > > Hear , Yahweh , my righteous plea ; Give ear to my prayer , that doesn 't go out of deceitful lips .
let my sentence come forth from your presence . let your eyes look on equity .
as for the works of men , by the word of your lips , I have kept myself from the ways of the violent .
my steps have held fast to your paths . my feet have not slipped .
I have called on you , for you will answer me , God . turn your ear to me . hear my speech .
show your marvelous loving kindness , you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies .
keep me as the apple of your eye . hide me under the shadow of your wings ,
from the wicked who oppress me , my deadly enemies , who surround me .
they have now surrounded us in our steps . they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth .
he is like a lion that is greedy of his prey , as it were a young lion lurking in secret places .
as for me , I shall see your face in righteousness . I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with seeing your form .
I call on Yahweh , who is worthy to be praised ; and I am saved from my enemies .
the cords of death surrounded me . the floods of ungodliness made me afraid .
the cords of Sheol were around me . the snares of death came on me .
in my distress I called on Yahweh , and cried to my God . he heard my voice out of his temple . my cry before him came into his ears .
then the earth shook and trembled . the foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken , because he was angry .
smoke went out of his nostrils . consuming fire came out of his mouth . Coals were kindled by it .
he bowed the heavens also , and came down . thick darkness was under his feet .
he rode on a cherub , and flew . yes , he soared on the wings of the wind .
he made darkness his hiding place , his pavilion around him , darkness of waters , thick clouds of the skies .
at the brightness before him his thick clouds passed , hailstones and coals of fire .
Yahweh also thundered in the sky . the Most High uttered his voice : hailstones and coals of fire .
he sent out his arrows , and scattered them ; Yes , great lightning bolts , and routed them .
then the channels of waters appeared . the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke , Yahweh , at the blast of the breath of your nostrils .
he sent from on high . he took me . he drew me out of many waters .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , from those who hated me ; for they were too mighty for me .
they came on me in the day of my calamity , but Yahweh was my support .
he brought me forth also into a large place . he delivered me , because he delighted in me .
Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness . according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me .
for I have kept the ways of Yahweh , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
for all his ordinances were before me . I didn 't put away his statutes from me .
I was also blameless with him . I kept myself from my iniquity .
therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness , according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight .
with the merciful you will show yourself merciful . with the perfect man , you will show yourself perfect .
with the pure , you will show yourself pure . with the crooked you will show yourself shrewd .
for you will save the afflicted people , but the haughty eyes you will bring down .
for by you , I advance through a troop . by my God , I leap over a wall .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yahweh is tried . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
he teaches my hands to war , so that my arms bend a bow of bronze .
you have also given me the shield of your salvation . your right hand sustains me . your gentleness has made me great .
you have enlarged my steps under me , My feet have not slipped .
I will pursue my enemies , and overtake them . neither will I turn again until they are consumed .
I will strike them through , so that they will not be able to rise . they shall fall under my feet .
for you have armed me with strength to the battle . you have subdued under me those who rose up against me .
you have also made my enemies turn their backs to me , that I might cut off those who hate me .
they cried , but there was none to save ; even to Yahweh , but he didn 't answer them .
then I beat them small as the dust before the wind . I cast them out as the mire of the streets .
you have delivered me from the strivings of the people . you have made me the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me . the foreigners shall submit themselves to me .
the foreigners shall fade away , and shall come trembling out of their close places .
Yahweh lives ; and blessed be my rock . Exalted be the God of my salvation ,
even the God who executes vengeance for me , and subdues peoples under me .
he rescues me from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
therefore I will give thanks to you , Yahweh , among the nations , and will sing praises to your name .
he gives great deliverance to his king , and shows loving kindness to his anointed , to David and to his seed , forevermore .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > The heavens declare the glory of God . the expanse shows his handiwork .
their voice has gone out through all the earth , their words to the end of the world . in them he has set a tent for the sun ,
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room , like a strong man rejoicing to run his course .
his going forth is from the end of the heavens , his circuit to its ends ; There is nothing hidden from its heat .
Yahweh 's precepts are right , rejoicing the heart . Yahweh 's commandment is pure , enlightening the eyes .
more to be desired are they than gold , yes , than much fine gold ; sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb .
moreover by them is your servant warned . in keeping them there is great reward .
keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins . let them not have dominion over me . then I will be upright . I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble . May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high ,
May He grant you your heart 's desire , and fulfill all your counsel .
we will triumph in your salvation . in the name of our God , we will set up our banners . May Yahweh grant all your requests .
now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed . he will answer him from his holy heaven , with the saving strength of his right hand .
some trust in chariots , and some in horses , but we trust the name of Yahweh our God .
you have given him his heart 's desire , and have not withheld the request of his lips . Selah .
for you meet him with the blessings of Goodness . you set a crown of fine gold on his head .
he asked life of you , you gave it to him , even length of days forever and ever .
for you make him most blessed forever . you make him glad with joy in your presence .
for the king trusts in Yahweh . through the loving kindness of the Most High , he shall not be moved .
your hand will find out all of your enemies . your right hand will find out those who hate you .
you will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger . Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath . the fire shall devour them .
you will destroy their descendants from the earth , their posterity from among the children of men .
for you will make them turn their back , when you aim drawn bows at their face .
my God , I cry in the daytime , but you don 't answer ; in the night season , and am not silent .
they cried to you , and were delivered . they trusted in you , and were not disappointed .
all those who see me mock me . they insult me with their lips . they shake their heads , saying ,
but you brought me out of the womb . you made me trust at my mother 's breasts .
I was thrown on you from my mother 's womb . you are my God since my mother bore me .
Don 't be far from me , for trouble is near . for there is none to help .
I am poured out like water . all my bones are out of joint . my heart is like wax ; it is melted within me .
my strength is dried up like a potsherd . my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth . you have brought me into the dust of death .
for dogs have surrounded me . a company of evildoers have enclosed me . they have pierced my hands and feet .
deliver my soul from the sword , my precious life from the power of the dog .
save me from the lion 's mouth ! yes , from the horns of the wild oxen , you have answered me .
I will declare your name to my brothers . in the midst of the assembly , I will praise you .
for he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted , Neither has he hidden his face from him ; but when he cried to him , he heard .
of you comes my praise in the great assembly . I will pay my vows before those who fear him .
the humble shall eat and be satisfied . they shall praise Yahweh who seek after him . let your hearts live forever .
all the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh . all the relatives of the nations shall worship before you .
for the kingdom is Yahweh 's . he is the ruler over the nations .
all the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship . all those who go down to the dust shall bow before him , even he who can 't keep his soul alive .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh is my shepherd : I shall lack nothing .
he restores my soul . he guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake .
even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for you are with me . your rod and your staff , they comfort me .
you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies . you anoint my head with oil . my cup runs over .
surely Goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life , and I will dwell in Yahweh 's house forever .
< < A Psalm by David . > > The earth is Yahweh 's , with its fullness ; the world , and those who dwell therein .
who may ascend to Yahweh 's hill ? who may stand in his holy place ?
he who has clean hands and a pure heart ; who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood , and has not sworn deceitfully .
he shall receive a blessing from Yahweh , righteousness from the God of his salvation .
this is the generation of those who seek Him , who seek your face--even Jacob . Selah .
lift up your heads , you gates ! be lifted up , you everlasting doors , and the King of glory will come in .
lift up your heads , you gates ; yes , lift them up , you everlasting doors , and the King of glory will come in .
< < By David . > > To you , Yahweh , do I lift up my soul .
my God , I have trusted in you . Don 't let me be shamed . Don 't let my enemies triumph over me .
yes , no one who waits for you shall be shamed . they shall be shamed who deal treacherously without cause .
guide me in your truth , and teach me , For you are the God of my salvation , I wait for you all day long .
Don 't remember the sins of my youth , nor my transgressions . remember me according to your loving kindness , for your Goodness ' sake , Yahweh .
all the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth to such as keep his Covenant and his testimonies .
what man is he who fears Yahweh ? he shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose .
the friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him . he will show them his Covenant .
my eyes are ever on Yahweh , for he will pluck my feet out of the net .
the troubles of my heart are enlarged . Oh bring me out of my distresses .
Oh keep my soul , and deliver me . let me not be disappointed , for I take refuge in you .
< < By David . > > Judge me , Yahweh , for I have walked in my integrity . I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering .
I have not sat with deceitful men , neither will I go in with hypocrites .
that I may make the voice of Thanksgiving to be heard , and tell of all your wondrous works .
Don 't gather my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloodthirsty men ;
but as for me , I will walk in my integrity . redeem me , and be merciful to me .
< < By David . > > Yahweh is my light and my salvation . whom shall I fear ? Yahweh is the strength of my life . of whom shall I be afraid ?
when evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh , even my adversaries and my foes , they stumbled and fell .
though an army should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear . though war should rise against me , even then I will be confident .
for in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion . in the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me . he will lift me up on a rock .
now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me . I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent . I will sing , yes , I will sing praises to Yahweh .
hear , Yahweh , when I cry with my voice . have mercy also on me , and answer me .
Don 't deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries , for false witnesses have risen up against me , such as breathe out cruelty .
I am still confident of this : I will see the Goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living .
hear the voice of my petitions , when I cry to you , when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place .
Don 't draw me away with the wicked , with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors , but mischief is in their hearts .
because they don 't respect the works of Yahweh , nor the operation of his hands , he will break them down and not build them up .
blessed be Yahweh , because he has heard the voice of my petitions .
Yahweh is my strength and my shield . my heart has trusted in him , and I am helped . therefore my heart greatly rejoices . with my song I will thank him .
Yahweh is their strength . he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed .
Yahweh 's voice is on the waters . the God of glory thunders , even Yahweh on many waters .
the voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars . yes , Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon .
he makes them also to skip like a calf ; Lebanon and Sirion like a young , wild ox .
Yahweh will give strength to his people . Yahweh will bless his people with peace .
< < A Psalm . a Song for the Dedication of the Temple . by David . > > I will extol you , Yahweh , for you have raised me up , and have not made my foes to rejoice over me .
Yahweh , you have brought up my soul from Sheol . you have kept me alive , that I should not go down to the pit .
for his anger is but for a moment . his favor is for a lifetime . weeping may stay for the night , but joy comes in the morning .
as for me , I said in my prosperity , " I shall never be moved . "
you , Yahweh , when you favored me , made my mountain stand strong ; but when you hid your face , I was troubled .
you have turned my mourning into dancing for me . you have removed my sackcloth , and clothed me with gladness ,
to the end that my heart may sing praise to you , and not be silent . Yahweh my God , I will give thanks to you forever !
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > In you , Yahweh , I take refuge . let me never be disappointed . deliver me in your righteousness .
Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me , for you are my stronghold .
I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness , for you have seen my affliction . you have known my soul in adversities .
you have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy . you have set my feet in a large place .
have mercy on me , Yahweh , for I am in distress . my eye , my soul , and my body waste away with grief .
for my life is spent with sorrow , my years with sighing . my strength fails because of my iniquity . my bones are wasted away .
because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors , A fear to my acquaintances . those who saw me on the street fled from me .
for I have heard the slander of many , terror on every side , while they conspire together against me , they plot to take away my life .
my times are in your hand . deliver me from the hand of my enemies , and from those who persecute me .
make your face to shine on your servant . save me in your loving kindness .
let me not be disappointed , Yahweh , for I have called on you . let the wicked be disappointed . let them be silent in Sheol .
Oh how great is your Goodness , which you have laid up for those who fear you , which you have worked for those who take refuge in you , before the sons of men !
in the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man . you will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues .
praise be to Yahweh , for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city .
blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn 't impute iniquity , in whose spirit there is no deceit .
when I kept silence , my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long .
for day and night your hand was heavy on me . my strength was sapped in the heat of summer . Selah .
I acknowledged my sin to you . I didn 't hide my iniquity . I said , I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh , and you forgave the iniquity of my sin . Selah .
for this , let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found . surely when the great waters overflow , they shall not reach to him .
you are my hiding place . you will preserve me from trouble . you will surround me with songs of deliverance . Selah .
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go . I will counsel you with my eye on you .
Don 't be like the horse , or like the mule , which have no understanding , who are controlled by bit and bridle , or else they will not come near to you .
many sorrows come to the wicked , but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh .
give thanks to Yahweh with the Lyre . sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings .
he loves righteousness and justice . the earth is full of the loving kindness of Yahweh .
by Yahweh 's word , the heavens were made ; all their army by the breath of his mouth .
he gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap . he lays up the deeps in storehouses .
let all the earth fear Yahweh . let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him .
Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing . he makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect .
blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh , the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance .
from the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth ,
there is no king saved by the multitude of an army . a mighty man is not delivered by great strength .
a horse is a vain thing for safety , neither does he deliver any by his great power .
behold , Yahweh 's eye is on those who fear him , on those who hope in his loving kindness ;
our soul has waited for Yahweh . he is our help and our shield .
let your loving kindness be on us , Yahweh , since we have hoped in you .
they looked to him , and were radiant . their faces shall never be covered with shame .
this poor man cried , and Yahweh heard him , and saved him out of all his troubles .
Oh fear Yahweh , you his saints , for there is no lack with those who fear him .
the young lions do lack , and suffer hunger , but those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any good thing .
who is someone who desires life , and loves many days , that he may see good ?
Yahweh 's face is against those who do evil , to cut off their memory from the earth .
the righteous cry , and Yahweh hears , and delivers them out of all their troubles .
Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart , and saves those who have a crushed spirit .
many are the afflictions of the righteous , but Yahweh delivers him out of them all .
Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants . none of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned .
< < By David . > > contend , Yahweh , with those who contend with me . fight against those who fight against me .
let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor . let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded .
for without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me . without cause they have dug a pit for my soul .
let destruction come on him unawares . let his net that he has hidden catch himself . let him fall into that destruction .
all my bones shall say , " Yahweh , who is like you , who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him ; yes , the poor and the needy from him who robs him ? "
Unrighteous witnesses rise up . they ask me about things that I don 't know about .
I will give you thanks in the great assembly . I will praise you among many people .
Don 't let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me ; neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes .
for they don 't speak peace , but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land .
let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity . let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me .
let them shout for joy and be glad , who favor my righteous cause . yes , let them say continually , " Yahweh be magnified , who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant ! "
< < For the Chief Musician . by David , the servant of Yahweh . > > An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked : " there is no fear of God before his eyes . "
for he flatters himself in his own eyes , too much to detect and hate his sin .
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit . he has ceased to be wise and to do good .
he plots iniquity on his bed . he sets himself in a way that is not good . he doesn 't abhor evil .
your loving kindness , Yahweh , is in the heavens . your faithfulness reaches to the skies .
how precious is your loving kindness , God ! the children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings .
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house . you will make them drink of the river of your pleasures .
for with you is the spring of life . in your light shall we see light .
Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you , your righteousness to the upright in heart .
Don 't let the foot of pride come against me . Don 't let the hand of the wicked drive me away .
there the workers of iniquity are fallen . they are thrust down , and shall not be able to rise .
< < By David . > > Don 't fret because of evildoers , neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness .
also delight yourself in Yahweh , and he will give you the desires of your heart .
he will make your righteousness go forth as the light , and your justice as the noon day sun .
rest in Yahweh , and wait patiently for him . Don 't fret because of him who prospers in his way , because of the man who makes wicked plots happen .
for yet a little while , and the wicked will be no more . yes , though you look for his place , he isn 't there .
but the humble shall inherit the land , and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , to kill those who are upright in the way .
their sword shall enter into their own heart . their bows shall be broken .
they shall not be disappointed in the time of evil . in the days of famine they shall be satisfied .
but the wicked shall perish . the enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields . they will vanish-- vanish like smoke .
for such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land . those who are Cursed by him shall be cut off .
though he stumble , he shall not fall , for Yahweh holds him up with his hand .
I have been young , and now am old , yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his children begging for bread .
all day long he deals graciously , and lends . his seed is blessed .
for Yahweh loves justice , and doesn 't forsake his saints . they are preserved forever , but the children of the wicked shall be cut off .
the law of his God is in his heart . none of his steps shall slide .
Yahweh will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged .
but he passed away , and behold , he was not . yes , I sought him , but he could not be found .
mark the perfect man , and see the upright , for there is a future for the man of peace .
as for transgressors , they shall be destroyed together . the future of the wicked shall be cut off .
but the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh . he is their stronghold in the time of trouble .
Yahweh helps them , and rescues them . he rescues them from the wicked , and saves them , Because they have taken refuge in him .
< < A Psalm by David , for a memorial . > > Yahweh , don 't rebuke me in your wrath , neither chasten me in your hot displeasure .
for your arrows have pierced me , your hand presses hard on me .
there is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation , neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin .
for my iniquities have gone over my head . as a heavy burden , they are too heavy for me .
for my waist is filled with burning . there is no soundness in my flesh .
I am faint and severely bruised . I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart .
my heart throbs . my strength fails me . as for the light of my eyes , it has also left me .
they also who seek after my life lay snares . those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things , and meditate deceits all day long .
but I , as a deaf man , don 't hear . I am as a mute man who doesn 't open his mouth .
yes , I am as a man who doesn 't hear , in whose mouth are no reproofs .
for I said , " Don 't let them gloat over me , or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips . "
for I am ready to fall . my pain is continually before me .
for I will declare my iniquity . I will be sorry for my sin .
they who also render evil for good are adversaries to me , because I follow what is good .
my heart was hot within me . while I meditated , the fire burned : I spoke with my tongue :
" surely every man walks like a shadow . surely they busy themselves in vain . he heaps up , and doesn 't know who shall gather .
deliver me from all my transgressions . Don 't make me the reproach of the foolish .
remove your scourge away from me . I am overcome by the blow of your hand .
" hear my prayer , Yahweh , and give ear to my cry . Don 't be silent at my tears . for I am a stranger with you , a foreigner , as all my fathers were .
Oh spare me , that I may recover strength , before I go away , and exist no more . "
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > I waited patiently for Yahweh . he turned to me , and heard my cry .
he brought me up also out of a horrible pit , out of the miry clay . he set my feet on a rock , and gave me a firm place to stand .
he has put a new song in my mouth , even praise to our God . many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in Yahweh .
blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust , and doesn 't respect the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
sacrifice and offering you didn 't desire . you have opened my ears . you have not required burnt offering and sin offering .
I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly . behold , I will not seal my lips , Yahweh , you know .
I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart . I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation . I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly .
Don 't withhold your tender mercies from me , Yahweh . let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me .
for innumerable evils have surrounded me . my iniquities have overtaken me , so that I am not able to look up . they are more than the hairs of my head . my heart has failed me .
let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it . let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt .
let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . let such as love your salvation say continually , " Let Yahweh be exalted ! "
but I am poor and needy . May the Lord think about me . you are my help and my deliverer . Don 't delay , my God .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > blessed is he who considers the poor . Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil .
Yahweh will preserve him , and keep him alive . he shall be blessed on the earth , and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies .
yes , my own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , who ate bread with me , has lifted up his heel against me .
but you , Yahweh , have mercy on me , and raise me up , that I may repay them .
by this I know that you delight in me , because my enemy doesn 't triumph over me .
as for me , you uphold me in my integrity , and set me in your presence forever .
< < For the Chief Musician . a contemplation by the sons of Korah . > > As the deer pants for the water brooks , so my soul pants after you , God .
my soul thirsts for God , for the living God . when shall I come and appear before God ?
why are you in despair , my soul ? why are you disturbed within me ? hope in God ! for I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence .
Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime . in the night his song shall be with me : a prayer to the God of my life .
as with a sword in my bones , my adversaries reproach me , while they continually ask me , " Where is your God ? "
why are you in despair , my soul ? why are you disturbed within me ? hope in God ! for I shall still praise him , the saving help of my countenance , and my God .
vindicate me , God , and plead my cause against an ungodly nation . Oh , deliver me from deceitful and wicked men .
for you are the God of my strength . why have you rejected me ? why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
Oh , send out your light and your truth . let them lead me . let them bring me to your holy hill , To your tents .
then I will go to the altar of God , to God , my exceeding joy . I will praise you on the harp , God , my God .
you drove out the nations with your hand , but you planted them . you afflicted the peoples , but you spread them abroad .
through you , will we push down our adversaries . through your name , will we tread them under who rise up against us .
for I will not trust in my bow , neither shall my sword save me .
in God we have made our boast all day long , we will give thanks to your name forever . Selah .
you make us turn back from the adversary . those who hate us take spoil for themselves .
you have made us like sheep for food , and have scattered us among the nations .
you make us a reproach to our neighbors , a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us .
you make us a byword among the nations , a shaking of the head among the peoples .
all day long my dishonor is before me , and shame covers my face ,
at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses , because of the enemy and the avenger .
all this has come on us , yet have we not forgotten you , Neither have we been false to your Covenant .
our heart has not turned back , neither have our steps strayed from your path ,
if we have forgotten the name of our God , or spread forth our hands to a strange god ;
yes , for your sake we are killed all day long . we are regarded as sheep for the slaughter .
for our soul is bowed down to the dust . our body clings to the earth .
you are the most excellent of the sons of men . grace has anointed your lips , therefore God has blessed you forever .
your arrows are sharp . the nations fall under you , with arrows in the heart of the king 's enemies .
all your garments smell like myrrh , aloes , and cassia . out of Ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad .
listen , daughter , consider , and turn your ear . forget your own people , and also your father 's house .
the daughter of Tyre comes with a gift . the rich among the people entreat your favor .
she shall be led to the king in embroidered work . the virgins , her companions who follow her , shall be brought to you .
with gladness and rejoicing they shall be led . they shall enter into the king 's palace .
your sons will take the place of your fathers . you shall make them princes in all the earth .
< < For the Chief Musician . by the sons of Korah . according to Alamoth.Alamoth is a musical term . > > God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .
therefore we won 't be afraid , though the earth changes , though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas ;
there is a river , the streams of which make the city of God glad , the holy place of the tents of the Most High .
the nations raged . the kingdoms were moved . he lifted his voice , and the earth melted .
come , see Yahweh 's works , what desolations he has made in the earth .
he makes wars cease to the end of the earth . he breaks the bow , and shatters the spear . he burns the chariots in the fire .
" be still , and know that I am God . I will be exalted among the nations . I will be exalted in the earth . "
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Oh clap your hands , all you nations . shout to God with the voice of triumph !
for Yahweh Most High is awesome . he is a great King over all the earth .
for God is the King of all the earth . sing praises with understanding .
the princes of the peoples are gathered together , the people of the God of Abraham . for the shields of the earth belong to God . he is greatly exalted !
< < A Song . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised , in the city of our God , in his holy mountain .
beautiful in elevation , the joy of the whole earth , is Mount Zion , on the north sides , the city of the great King .
they saw it , then they were amazed . they were dismayed . they hurried away .
as we have heard , so we have seen , in the city of Yahweh of Armies , in the city of our God . God will establish it forever . Selah .
as is your name , God , so is your praise to the ends of the earth . your right hand is full of righteousness .
let Mount Zion be glad ! let the daughters of Judah rejoice , Because of your judgments .
mark well her bulwarks . consider her palaces , that you may tell it to the next generation .
for this God is our God forever and ever . he will be our guide even to death .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Hear this , all you peoples . listen , all you inhabitants of the world ,
I will incline my ear to a proverb . I will open my riddle on the harp .
why should I fear in the days of evil , when iniquity at my heels surrounds me ?
those who trust in their wealth , and boast in the multitude of their riches--
none of them can by any means redeem his brother , nor give God a ransom for him .
for the redemption of their life is costly , no payment is ever enough ,
for he sees that wise men die ; likewise the fool and the senseless perish , and leave their wealth to others .
but man , despite his riches , doesn 't endure . he is like the animals that perish .
this is the destiny of those who are foolish , and of those who approve their sayings . Selah .
they are appointed as a flock for Sheol . death shall be their shepherd . the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning . their beauty shall decay in Sheol , far from their mansion .
but God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol , for he will receive me . Selah .
Don 't be afraid when a man is made rich , when the glory of his house is increased .
for when he dies he shall carry nothing away . his glory shall not descend after him .
though while he lived he blessed his soul-- and men praise you when you do well for yourself--
he shall go to the generation of his fathers . they shall never see the light .
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > The mighty One , God , Yahweh , speaks , and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset .
out of Zion , the perfection of beauty , God shines forth .
he calls to the heavens above , to the earth , that he may judge his people :
I don 't rebuke you for your sacrifices . your burnt offerings are continually before me .
for every animal of the forest is mine , and the livestock on a thousand hills .
I know all the birds of the mountains . the wild animals of the field are mine .
if I were hungry , I would not tell you , for the world is mine , and all that is in it .
call on me in the day of trouble . I will deliver you , and you will honor me . "
but to the wicked God says , " What right do you have to declare my statutes , that you have taken my Covenant on your lips ,
when you saw a thief , you consented with him , and have participated with adulterers .
you sit and speak against your brother . you slander your own mother 's son .
you have done these things , and I kept silent . you thought that I was just like you . I will rebuke you , and accuse you in front of your eyes .
" now consider this , you who forget God , lest I tear you into pieces , and there be none to deliver .
whoever offers the sacrifice of Thanksgiving glorifies me , and prepares his way so that I will show God 's salvation to him . "
against you , and you only , have I sinned , and done that which is evil in your sight ; that you may be proved right when you speak , and justified when you judge .
behold , you desire truth in the inward parts . you teach me wisdom in the inmost place .
purify me with hyssop , and I will be clean . wash me , and I will be whiter than snow .
hide your face from my sins , and blot out all of my iniquities .
for you don 't delight in sacrifice , or else I would give it . you have no pleasure in burnt offering .
God will likewise destroy you forever . he will take you up , and pluck you out of your tent , and root you out of the land of the living . Selah .
the righteous also will see it , and fear , and laugh at him , saying ,
but as for me , I am like a green olive tree in God 's house . I trust in God 's loving kindness forever and ever .
I will give you thanks forever , because you have done it . I will hope in your name , for it is good , in the presence of your saints .
God looks down from heaven on the children of men , to see if there are any who understood , who seek after God .
every one of them has gone back . they have become filthy together . there is no one who does good , no , not one .
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge , who eat up my people as they eat bread , and don 't call on God ?
Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! when God brings back his people from captivity , then Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
for strangers have risen up against me . violent men have sought after my soul . they haven 't set God before them . Selah .
behold , God is my helper . the Lord is the one who sustains my soul .
with a free will offering , I will sacrifice to you . I will give thanks to your name , Yahweh , for it is good .
for he has delivered me out of all trouble . my eye has seen triumph over my enemies .
because of the voice of the enemy , Because of the oppression of the wicked . for they bring suffering on me . in anger they hold a grudge against me .
my heart is severely pained within me . the terrors of death have fallen on me .
behold , then I would wander far off . I would lodge in the wilderness . " Selah .
destructive forces are within her . threats and lies don 't depart from her streets .
but it was you , a man like me , my companion , and my familiar friend .
let death come suddenly on them . let them go down alive into Sheol . for wickedness is in their dwelling , in their midst .
as for me , I will call on God . Yahweh will save me .
evening , morning , and at noon , I will cry out in distress . he will hear my voice .
he has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me , although there are many who oppose me .
he raises his hands against his friends . he has violated his Covenant .
his mouth was smooth as butter , but his heart was war . his words were softer than oil , yet they were drawn swords .
cast your burden on Yahweh , and he will sustain you . he will never allow the righteous to be moved .
my enemies want to swallow me up all day long , for they are many who fight proudly against me .
when I am afraid , I will put my trust in you .
in God , I praise his word . in God , I put my trust . I will not be afraid . what can flesh do to me ?
all day long they twist my words . all their thoughts are against me for evil .
you number my wanderings . you put my tears into your bottle . Aren 't they in your book ?
then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call . I know this , that God is for me .
I have put my trust in God . I will not be afraid . what can man do to me ?
for you have delivered my soul from death , and prevented my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living .
he will send from heaven , and save me , he rebukes the one who is pursuing me . Selah . God will send out his loving kindness and his truth .
my soul is among lions . I lie among those who are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
they have prepared a net for my steps . my soul is bowed down . they dig a pit before me . they fall into its midst themselves . Selah .
my heart is steadfast , God , my heart is steadfast . I will sing , yes , I will sing praises .
I will give thanks to you , Lord , among the peoples . I will sing praises to you among the nations .
for your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens , and your truth to the skies .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a poem by David . > > Do you indeed speak righteousness , silent ones ? do you judge blamelessly , you sons of men ?
no , in your heart you plot injustice . you measure out the violence of your hands in the earth .
the wicked go astray from the womb . they are wayward as soon as they are born , speaking lies .
their poison is like the poison of a snake ; like a deaf Cobra that stops its ear ,
which doesn 't listen to the voice of charmers , no matter how skillful the charmer may be .
let them vanish as water that flows away . when they draw the bow , let their arrows be made blunt .
let them be like a snail which melts and passes away , like the stillborn child , who has not seen the sun .
before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns , he will sweep away the green and the burning alike .
the righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance . he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked ;
for , behold , they lie in wait for my soul . the mighty gather themselves together against me , not for my disobedience , nor for my sin , Yahweh .
I have done no wrong , yet they are ready to attack me . rise up , behold , and help me !
behold , they spew with their mouth . swords are in their lips , " For , " they say , " who hears us ? "
my God will go before me with his loving kindness . God will let me look at my enemies in triumph .
Don 't kill them , or my people may forget . Scatter them by your power , and bring them down , Lord our shield .
for the sin of their mouth , and the words of their lips , let them be caught in their pride , for the curses and lies which they utter .
consume them in wrath . consume them , and they will be no more . let them know that God rules in Jacob , to the ends of the earth . Selah .
at evening let them return . let them howl like a dog , and go around the city .
they shall wander up and down for food , and wait all night if they aren 't satisfied .
to you , my strength , I will sing praises . for God is my high tower , the God of my mercy .
you have made the land tremble . you have torn it . mend its fractures , for it quakes .
you have shown your people hard things . you have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger .
you have given a banner to those who fear you , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah .
God has spoken from his sanctuary : " I will triumph . I will divide Shechem , and measure out the valley of Succoth .
Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine . Ephraim also is the defense of my head . Judah is my scepter .
through God we shall do valiantly , for it is he who will tread down our adversaries .
< < For the Chief Musician . for a stringed instrument . by David . > > Hear my cry , God . listen to my prayer .
from the end of the earth , I will call to you , when my heart is overwhelmed . lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
I will dwell in your tent forever . I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings . Selah .
for you , God , have heard my vows . you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name .
you will prolong the king 's life ; his years shall be for generations .
he shall be enthroned in God 's presence forever . appoint your loving kindness and truth , that they may preserve him .
< < For the Chief Musician . to Jeduthan . a Psalm by David . > > My soul rests in God alone . my salvation is from him .
he alone is my rock and my salvation , my fortress-- I will never be greatly shaken .
they fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place . they delight in lies . they bless with their mouth , but they curse inwardly . Selah .
he alone is my rock and my salvation , my fortress . I will not be shaken .
with God is my salvation and my honor . the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God .
trust in him at all times , you people . pour out your heart before him . God is a refuge for us . Selah .
surely men of low degree are just a breath , and men of high degree are a lie . in the balances they will go up . they are together lighter than a breath .
Don 't trust in oppression . Don 't become vain in robbery . if riches increase , don 't set your heart on them .
so I will bless you while I live . I will lift up my hands in your name .
my soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food . my mouth shall praise you with joyful lips ,
but those who seek my soul , to destroy it , shall go into the lower parts of the earth .
they shall be given over to the power of the sword . they shall be Jackal food .
but the king shall rejoice in God . everyone who swears by him will praise him , for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > Hear my voice , God , in my complaint . preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked , from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil ;
they encourage themselves in evil plans . they talk about laying snares secretly . they say , " Who will see them ? "
but God will shoot at them . they will be suddenly struck down with an arrow .
all mankind shall be afraid . they shall declare the work of God , and shall wisely ponder what he has done .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . a song . > > Praise waits for you , God , in Zion . to you shall vows be performed .
blessed is one whom you choose , and cause to come near , that he may live in your courts . we will be filled with the Goodness of your house , your holy temple .
by awesome deeds of righteousness , you answer us , God of our salvation . you who are the hope of all the ends of the earth , of those who are far away on the sea ;
who by his power forms the mountains , having armed yourself with strength ;
who stills the roaring of the seas , the roaring of their waves , and the turmoil of the nations .
they also who dwell in faraway places are afraid at your wonders . you call the morning 's dawn and the evening with songs of joy .
you visit the earth , and water it . you greatly enrich it . the river of God is full of water . you provide them grain , for so you have ordained it .
the pastures are covered with flocks . the valleys also are clothed with grain . they shout for joy ! they also sing .
< < For the Chief Musician . a song . a Psalm . > > Make a joyful shout to God , all the earth !
all the earth will worship you , and will sing to you ; they will sing to your name . " Selah .
he turned the sea into dry land . they went through the river on foot . there , we rejoiced in him .
he rules by his might forever . his eyes watch the nations . Don 't let the rebellious rise up against him . Selah .
who preserves our life among the living , and doesn 't allow our feet to be moved .
for you , God , have tested us . you have refined us , as silver is refined .
you allowed men to ride over our heads . we went through fire and through water , but you brought us to the place of abundance .
I will come into your temple with burnt offerings . I will pay my vows to you ,
I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals , with the offering of rams , I will offer bulls with goats . Selah .
I cried to him with my mouth . he was extolled with my tongue .
but most certainly , God has listened . he has heard the voice of my prayer .
< < For the Chief Musician . with stringed instruments . a Psalm . a song . > > May God be merciful to us , bless us , and cause his face to shine on us . Selah .
Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy , for you will judge the peoples with equity , and govern the nations on earth . Selah .
the earth has yielded its increase . God , even our own God , will bless us .
as smoke is driven away , so drive them away . as wax melts before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
but let the righteous be glad . let them rejoice before God . yes , let them rejoice with gladness .
a father of the fatherless , and a defender of the widows , is God in his holy habitation .
God sets the lonely in families . he brings out the prisoners with singing , but the rebellious dwell in a sun @-@ scorched land .
God , when you went forth before your people , when you marched through the wilderness ... Selah .
the earth trembled . the sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai-- at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
you , God , sent a plentiful rain . you confirmed your inheritance , when it was weary .
why do you look in envy , you rugged mountains , at the mountain where God chooses to reign ? yes , Yahweh will dwell there forever .
the chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands . the Lord is among them , from Sinai , into the sanctuary .
you have ascended on high . you have led away captives . you have received gifts among men , yes , among the rebellious also , that Yah God might dwell there .
blessed be the Lord , who daily bears our burdens , even the God who is our salvation . Selah .
God is to us a God of deliverance . to Yahweh , the Lord , belongs escape from death .
but God will strike through the head of his enemies , the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness .
the Lord said , " I will bring you again from Bashan , I will bring you again from the depths of the sea ;
that you may crush them , dipping your foot in blood , that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies . "
they have seen your processions , God , even the processions of my God , my King , into the sanctuary .
the singers went before , the minstrels followed after , in the midst of the ladies playing with tambourines ,
there is little Benjamin , their ruler , the princes of Judah , their council , the princes of Zebulun , and the princes of Naphtali .
princes shall come out of Egypt . Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God .
to him who rides on the heaven of heavens , which are of old ; behold , he utters his voice , a mighty voice .
Ascribe strength to God ! his excellency is over Israel , his strength is in the skies .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Lilies . " by David . > > Save me , God , for the waters have come up to my neck !
I sink in deep mire , where there is no foothold . I have come into deep waters , where the floods overflow me .
I am weary with my crying . my throat is dry . my eyes fail , looking for my God .
Don 't let those who wait for you be shamed through me , Lord Yahweh of Armies . Don 't let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me , God of Israel .
because for your sake , I have borne reproach . shame has covered my face .
I have become a stranger to my brothers , an alien to my mother 's children .
for the zeal of your house consumes me . the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me .
when I made sackcloth my clothing , I became a byword to them .
those who sit in the gate talk about me . I am the song of the drunkards .
but as for me , my prayer is to you , Yahweh , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation .
deliver me out of the mire , and don 't let me sink . let me be delivered from those who hate me , and out of the deep waters .
Don 't let the flood waters overwhelm me , neither let the deep swallow me up . Don 't let the pit shut its mouth on me .
answer me , Yahweh , for your loving kindness is good . according to the multitude of your tender mercies , turn to me .
Don 't hide your face from your servant , for I am in distress . answer me speedily !
draw near to my soul , and redeem it . ransom me because of my enemies .
reproach has broken my heart , and I am full of heaviness . I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; for comforters , but I found none .
they also gave me gall for my food . in my thirst , they gave me vinegar to drink .
let their table before them become a snare . May it become a retribution and a trap .
let their eyes be darkened , so that they can 't see . let their backs be continually bent .
pour out your indignation on them . let the fierceness of your anger overtake them .
let their habitation be desolate . let no one dwell in their tents .
for they persecute him whom you have wounded . they tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt .
charge them with crime upon crime . Don 't let them come into your righteousness .
let them be blotted out of the book of life , and not be written with the righteous .
I will praise the name of God with a song , and will magnify him with Thanksgiving .
the humble have seen it , and are glad . you who seek after God , let your heart live .
for God will save Zion , and build the cities of Judah . they shall settle there , and own it .
let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul . let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace .
let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . let those who love your salvation continually say , " Let God be exalted ! "
deliver me in your righteousness , and rescue me . turn your ear to me , and save me .
be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go . give the command to save me , for you are my rock and my fortress .
rescue me , my God , from the hand of the wicked , from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man .
I have relied on you from the womb . you are he who took me out of my mother 's womb . I will always praise you .
Don 't reject me in my old age . Don 't forsake me when my strength fails .
let my accusers be disappointed and consumed . let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me .
my mouth will tell about your righteousness , and of your salvation all day , though I don 't know its full measure .
I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh . I will make mention of your righteousness , even of yours alone .
God , you have taught me from my youth . until now , I have declared your wondrous works .
yes , even when I am old and gray @-@ haired , God , don 't forsake me , until I have declared your strength to the next generation , your might to everyone who is to come .
you , who have shown us many and bitter troubles , you will let me live . you will bring us up again from the depths of the earth .
I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness , my God . I sing praises to you with the Lyre , Holy One of Israel .
my tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long , for they are disappointed , and they are confounded , who want to harm me .
< < By Solomon . > > God , give the king your justice ; your righteousness to the royal son .
the mountains shall bring prosperity to the people . the hills bring the fruit of righteousness .
he will judge the poor of the people . he will save the children of the needy , and will break the oppressor in pieces .
in his days , the righteous shall flourish , and abundance of peace , until the moon is no more .
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea , from the River to the ends of the earth .
those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him . his enemies shall lick the dust .
the kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute . the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts .
for he will deliver the needy when he cries ; the poor , who has no helper .
he will have pity on the poor and needy . he will save the souls of the needy .
they shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba . men shall pray for him continually . they shall bless him all day long .
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > surely God is good to Israel , to those who are pure in heart .
for I was envious of the arrogant , when I saw the prosperity of the wicked .
for there are no struggles in their death , but their strength is firm .
they are free from burdens of men , neither are they plagued like other men .
they have set their mouth in the heavens . their tongue walks through the earth .
behold , these are the wicked . being always at ease , they increase in riches .
if I had said , " I will speak thus " ; behold , I would have betrayed the generation of your children .
for my soul was grieved . I was embittered in my heart .
whom do I have in heaven ? there is no one on earth whom I desire besides you .
for , behold , those who are far from you shall perish . you have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you .
but it is good for me to come close to God . I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge , that I may tell of all your works .
< < A contemplation by Asaph . > > God , why have you rejected us forever ? why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture ?
remember your Congregation , which you purchased of old , which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance ; Mount Zion , in which you have lived .
lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins , all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary .
your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly . they have set up their standards as signs .
they behaved like men wielding axes , cutting through a thicket of trees .
they have burned your sanctuary to the ground . they have profaned the dwelling place of your Name .
we see no miraculous signs . there is no longer any prophet , neither is there among us anyone who knows how long .
why do you draw back your hand , even your right hand ? take it out of your pocket and consume them !
you divided the sea by your strength . you broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters .
you broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces . you gave him as food to people and desert creatures .
Don 't deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts . Don 't forget the life of your poor forever .
Don 't forget the voice of your adversaries . the tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually .
I said to the arrogant , " Don 't boast ! " I said to the wicked , " Don 't lift up the Horn .
Don 't lift up your Horn on high . Don 't speak with a stiff neck . "
for neither from the east , nor from the west , nor yet from the south , comes exaltation .
but God is the judge . he puts down one , and lifts up another .
for in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup , full of foaming wine mixed with spices . he pours it out . indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs .
but I will declare this forever : I will sing praises to the God of Jacob .
I will cut off all the horns of the wicked , but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up .
< < For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a Psalm by Asaph . a song . > > In Judah , God is known . his name is great in Israel .
his tabernacle is also in Salem ; His dwelling place in Zion .
there he broke the flaming arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the weapons of war . Selah .
valiant men lie plundered , they have slept their last sleep . none of the men of war can lift their hands .
at your rebuke , God of Jacob , both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep .
you , even you , are to be feared . who can stand in your sight when you are angry ?
make vows to Yahweh your God , and fulfill them ! let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared .
he will cut off the spirit of princes . he is feared by the kings of the earth .
< < For the Chief Musician . to Jeduthun . a Psalm by Asaph . > > My cry goes to God ! indeed , I cry to God for help , and for him to listen to me .
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord . my hand was stretched out in the night , and didn 't get tired . my soul refused to be comforted .
I remember God , and I groan . I complain , and my spirit is overwhelmed . Selah .
you hold my eyelids open . I am so troubled that I can 't speak .
I have considered the days of old , the years of ancient times .
I remember my song in the night . I consider in my own heart ; my spirit diligently inquires :
you are the God who does wonders . you have made your strength known among the peoples .
the voice of your Thunder was in the whirlwind . the lightnings lit up the world . the earth trembled and shook .
your way was through the sea ; your paths through the great waters . your footsteps were not known .
< < A contemplation by Asaph . > > Hear my teaching , my people . turn your ears to the words of my mouth .
I will open my mouth in a parable . I will utter dark sayings of old ,
we will not hide them from their children , telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh , his strength , and his wondrous works that he has done .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a teaching in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children ;
that the generation to come might know , even the children who should be born ; who should arise and tell their children ,
that they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God , but keep his commandments ,
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that didn 't make their hearts loyal , whose spirit was not steadfast with God .
the children of Ephraim , being armed and carrying bows , turned back in the day of battle .
they forgot his doings , his wondrous works that he had shown them .
he did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers , in the land of Egypt , in the field of Zoan .
he split the sea , and caused them to pass through . he made the waters stand as a heap .
in the daytime he also led them with a cloud , and all night with a light of fire .
he brought streams also out of the rock , and caused waters to run down like rivers .
yet they still went on to sin against him , to rebel against the Most High in the desert .
they tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire .
behold , he struck the rock , so that waters gushed out , and streams overflowed . can he give bread also ? will he provide flesh for his people ? "
therefore Yahweh heard , and was angry . a fire was kindled against Jacob , anger also went up against Israel ,
because they didn 't believe in God , and didn 't trust in his salvation .
he rained down manna on them to eat , and gave them food from the sky .
he caused the east wind to blow in the sky . by his power he guided the south wind .
he rained also flesh on them as the dust ; winged birds as the sand of the seas .
he let them fall in the midst of their camp , around their habitations .
they didn 't turn from their cravings . their food was yet in their mouths ,
when the anger of God went up against them , killed some of their fattest , and struck down the young men of Israel .
when he killed them , then they inquired after him . they returned and sought God earnestly .
but they flattered him with their mouth , and lied to him with their tongue .
for their heart was not right with him , neither were they faithful in his Covenant .
but he , being merciful , forgave iniquity , and didn 't destroy them . yes , many times he turned his anger away , and didn 't stir up all his wrath .
he remembered that they were but flesh , a wind that passes away , and doesn 't come again .
they turned again and tempted God , and provoked the Holy One of Israel .
they didn 't remember his hand , nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary ;
how he set his signs in Egypt , his wonders in the field of Zoan ,
he turned their rivers into blood , and their streams , so that they could not drink .
he sent among them swarms of flies , which devoured them ; and frogs , which destroyed them .
he gave also their increase to the caterpillar , and their labor to the locust .
he gave over their livestock also to the hail , and their flocks to hot thunderbolts .
he threw on them the fierceness of his anger , wrath , indignation , and trouble , and a band of angels of evil .
he made a path for his anger . he didn 't spare their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pestilence ,
and struck all the firstborn in Egypt , the chief of their strength in the tents of ham .
but he led forth his own people like sheep , and guided them in the wilderness like a flock .
he led them safely , so that they weren 't afraid , but the sea overwhelmed their enemies .
he brought them to the border of his sanctuary , to this mountain , which his right hand had taken .
he also drove out the nations before them , allotted them for an inheritance by line , and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents .
yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God , and didn 't keep his testimonies ;
but turned back , and dealt treacherously like their fathers . they were turned aside like a deceitful bow .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images .
so that he forsook the tent of Shiloh , the tent which he placed among men ;
he also gave his people over to the sword , and was angry with his inheritance .
then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep , like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine .
moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph , and didn 't choose the tribe of Ephraim ,
he built his sanctuary like the heights , like the earth which he has established forever .
from following the ewes that have their young , he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob , his people , and Israel , his inheritance .
so he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart , and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands .
they have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky , the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth .
their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem . there was no one to bury them .
we have become a reproach to our neighbors , a scoffing and derision to those who are around us .
pour out your wrath on the nations that don 't know you ; on the kingdoms that don 't call on your name ;
Don 't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us . let your tender mercies speedily meet us , for we are in desperate need .
help us , God of our salvation , for the glory of your name . deliver us , and forgive our sins , for your name 's sake .
why should the nations say , " Where is their God ? " let it be known among the nations , before our eyes , that vengeance for your servants ' blood is being poured out .
let the sighing of the prisoner come before you . according to the greatness of your power , preserve those who are sentenced to death .
pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you , Lord .
so we , your people and sheep of your pasture , will give you thanks forever . we will praise you forever , to all generations .
you have fed them with the bread of tears , and given them tears to drink in large measure .
you make us a source of contention to our neighbors . our enemies laugh among themselves .
you brought a vine out of Egypt . you drove out the nations , and planted it .
it sent out its branches to the sea , Its shoots to the River .
why have you broken down its walls , so that all those who pass by the way pluck it ?
the Boar out of the wood ravages it . the wild animals of the field feed on it .
the stock which your right hand planted , the branch that you made strong for yourself .
it 's burned with fire . it 's cut down . they perish at your rebuke .
let your hand be on the man of your right hand , on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself .
so we will not turn away from you . revive us , and we will call on your name .
he appointed it in Joseph for a testimony , when he went out over the land of Egypt , I heard a language that I didn 't know .
you called in trouble , and I delivered you . I answered you in the secret place of Thunder . I tested you at the waters of Meribah . " Selah .
there shall be no strange god in you , neither shall you worship any foreign god .
I am Yahweh , your God , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt . open your mouth wide , and I will fill it .
so I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts , that they might walk in their own counsels .
Oh that my people would listen to me , that Israel would walk in my ways !
I would soon subdue their enemies , and turn my hand against their adversaries .
but he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat . I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock . "
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > God presides in the great assembly . he judges among the gods .
" defend the weak , the poor , and the fatherless . maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed .
they don 't know , neither do they understand . they walk back and forth in darkness . all the foundations of the earth are shaken .
< < A song . a Psalm by Asaph . > > God , don 't keep silent . Don 't keep silent , and don 't be still , God .
for , behold , your enemies are stirred up . those who hate you have lifted up their heads .
" come , " they say , " and let 's destroy them as a nation , that the name of Israel may be remembered no more . "
the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites ; Moab , and the Hagrites ;
Assyria also is joined with them . they have helped the children of lot . Selah .
do to them as you did to Midian , as to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the river Kishon ;
as the fire that burns the forest , as the flame that sets the mountains on fire ,
so pursue them with your tempest , and terrify them with your storm .
that they may know that you alone , whose name is Yahweh , are the Most High over all the earth .
< < For the Chief Musician . on an instrument of Gath . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > How lovely are your dwellings , Yahweh of Armies !
my soul longs , and even faints for the courts of Yahweh . my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God .
yes , the sparrow has found a home , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may have her young , near your altars , Yahweh of Armies , my King , and my God .
passing through the valley of Weeping , they make it a place of springs . yes , the autumn rain covers it with blessings .
they go from strength to strength . everyone of them appears before God in Zion .
for a day in your courts is better than a thousand . I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
for Yahweh God is a sun and a shield . Yahweh will give grace and glory . he Withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Yahweh , you have been favorable to your land . you have restored the fortunes of Jacob .
you have forgiven the iniquity of your people . you have covered all their sin . Selah .
you have taken away all your wrath . you have turned from the fierceness of your anger .
mercy and truth meet together . Righteousness and peace have kissed each other .
< < A Prayer by David . > > Hear , Yahweh , and answer me , for I am poor and needy .
preserve my soul , for I am godly . you , my God , save your servant who trusts in you .
bring joy to the soul of your servant , for to you , Lord , do I lift up my soul .
for you , Lord , are good , and ready to forgive ; abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you .
in the day of my trouble I will call on you , for you will answer me .
there is no one like you among the gods , Lord , nor any deeds like your deeds .
all nations you have made will come and worship before you , Lord . they shall glorify your name .
I will praise you , Lord my God , with my whole heart . I will glorify your name forevermore .
for your loving kindness is great toward me . you have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol .
God , the proud have risen up against me . a company of violent men have sought after my soul , and they don 't hold regard for you before them .
turn to me , and have mercy on me ! give your strength to your servant . save the son of your handmaid .
show me a sign of your Goodness , that those who hate me may see it , and be shamed , because you , Yahweh , have helped me , and comforted me .
< < A Psalm by the sons of Korah ; a Song . > > His foundation is in the holy mountains .
let my prayer enter into your presence . turn your ear to my cry .
I am counted among those who go down into the pit . I am like a man who has no help ,
set apart among the dead , like the slain who lie in the grave , whom you remember no more . they are cut off from your hand .
your wrath lies heavily on me . you have afflicted me with all your waves . Selah .
you have taken my friends from me . you have made me an abomination to them . I am confined , and I can 't escape .
my eyes are dim from grief . I have called on you daily , Yahweh . I have spread out my hands to you .
do you show wonders to the dead ? do the dead rise up and praise you ? Selah .
are your wonders made known in the dark ? or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness ?
I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up . while I suffer your terrors , I am distracted .
you have put lover and friend far from me , and my friends into darkness .
< < A contemplation by Ethan , the Ezrahite . > > I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever . with my mouth , I will make known your faithfulness to all generations .
I indeed declare , " Love stands firm forever . you established the heavens . your faithfulness is in them . "
the heavens will praise your wonders , Yahweh ; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones .
for who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh ? who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh ,
a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones , to be feared above all those who are around him ?
you rule the pride of the sea . when its waves rise up , you calm them .
you have broken Rahab in pieces , like one of the slain . you have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm .
the heavens are yours . the earth also is yours ; the world and its fullness . you have founded them .
you have a mighty arm . your hand is strong , and your right hand is exalted .
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne . loving kindness and truth go before your face .
blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you . they walk in the light of your presence , Yahweh .
in your name they rejoice all day . in your righteousness , they are exalted .
for you are the glory of their strength . in your favor , our Horn will be exalted .
for our shield belongs to Yahweh ; our king to the Holy One of Israel .
then you spoke in vision to your saints , and said , " I have bestowed strength on the warrior . I have exalted a young man from the people .
I have found David , my servant . I have anointed him with my holy oil ,
with whom my hand shall be established . my arm will also strengthen him .
I will beat down his adversaries before him , and strike those who hate him .
but my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him . in my name , his Horn will be exalted .
I will set his hand also on the sea , and his right hand on the rivers .
he will call to me , ' You are my Father , my God , and the rock of my salvation ! '
I will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore . my Covenant will stand firm with him .
I will also make his seed endure forever , and his throne as the days of heaven .
if they break my statutes , and don 't keep my commandments ;
then I will punish their sin with the rod , and their iniquity with stripes .
but I will not completely take my loving kindness from him , nor allow my faithfulness to fail .
I will not break my Covenant , nor alter what my lips have uttered .
you have renounced the Covenant of your servant . you have defiled his crown in the dust .
you have broken down all his hedges . you have brought his strongholds to ruin .
all who pass by the way rob him . he has become a reproach to his neighbors .
yes , you turn back the edge of his sword , and haven 't supported him in battle .
you have ended his splendor , and thrown his throne down to the ground .
you have shortened the days of his youth . you have covered him with shame . Selah .
remember how short my time is ! for what vanity have you created all the children of men !
what man is he who shall live and not see death , who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol ? Selah .
before the mountains were brought forth , before you had formed the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting , you are God .
for a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past , like a watch in the night .
in the morning it sprouts and springs up . by evening , it is withered and dry .
for we are consumed in your anger . we are troubled in your wrath .
you have set our iniquities before you , our secret sins in the light of your presence .
for all our days have passed away in your wrath . we bring our years to an end as a sigh .
who knows the power of your anger , your wrath according to the fear that is due to you ?
satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness , that we may rejoice and be glad all our days .
make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us , for as many years as we have seen evil .
let the favor of the Lord our God be on us ; establish the work of our hands for us ; yes , establish the work of our hands .
he who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty .
for he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler , and from the deadly pestilence .
he will cover you with his feathers . under his wings you will take refuge . his faithfulness is your shield and rampart .
a thousand may fall at your side , and ten thousand at your right hand ; but it will not come near you .
you will only look with your eyes , and see the recompense of the wicked .
no evil shall happen to you , neither shall any plague come near your dwelling .
for he will put his angels in charge of you , to guard you in all your ways .
they will bear you up in their hands , so that you won 't dash your foot against a stone .
you will tread on the lion and Cobra . you will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot .
" because he has set his love on me , therefore I will deliver him . I will set him on high , because he has known my name .
he will call on me , and I will answer him . I will be with him in trouble . I will deliver him , and honor him .
for you , Yahweh , have made me glad through your work . I will triumph in the works of your hands .
a senseless man doesn 't know , neither does a fool understand this :
for , behold , your enemies , Yahweh , for , behold , your enemies shall perish . all the evildoers will be scattered .
but you have exalted my Horn like that of the wild ox . I am anointed with fresh oil .
my eye has also seen my enemies . my ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me .
the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree . he will grow like a cedar in Lebanon .
they are planted in Yahweh 's house . they will flourish in our God 's courts .
they will still bring forth fruit in old age . they will be full of SAP and green ,
Yahweh reigns ! he is clothed with majesty ! Yahweh is armed with strength . the world also is established . it can 't be moved .
the floods have lifted up , Yahweh , the floods have lifted up their voice . the floods lift up their waves .
above the voices of many waters , the mighty breakers of the sea , Yahweh on high is mighty .
he who implanted the ear , won 't he hear ? he who formed the eye , won 't he see ?
he who disciplines the nations , won 't he punish ? he who teaches man knows .
that you may give him rest from the days of adversity , until the pit is dug for the wicked .
who will rise up for me against the wicked ? who will stand up for me against the evildoers ?
in the multitude of my thoughts within me , your comforts delight my soul .
shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you , which brings about mischief by statute ?
they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous , and condemn the innocent blood .
but Yahweh has been my high tower , my God , the rock of my refuge .
he has brought on them their own iniquity , and will cut them off in their own wickedness . Yahweh , our God , will cut them off .
Oh come , let 's sing to Yahweh . let 's shout aloud to the rock of our salvation !
let 's come before his presence with Thanksgiving . let 's extol him with songs !
in his hand are the deep places of the earth . the heights of the mountains are also his .
Oh come , let 's worship and bow down . let 's kneel before Yahweh , our Maker ,
for he is our God . we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep in his care . today , oh that you would hear his voice !
Don 't harden your heart , as at Meribah , as in the day of Massah in the wilderness ,
forty long years I was grieved with that generation , and said , " It is a people that errs in their heart . they have not known my ways . "
therefore I swore in my wrath , " They won 't enter into my rest . "
declare his glory among the nations , his marvelous works among all the peoples .
for great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised ! he is to be feared above all gods .
Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name . bring an offering , and come into his courts .
say among the nations , " Yahweh reigns . " the world is also established . it can 't be moved . he will judge the peoples with equity .
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice . let the sea roar , and its fullness !
a fire goes before him , and burns up his adversaries on every side .
the mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh , at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth .
let all them be shamed who serve engraved images , who boast in their idols . worship him , all you gods !
Zion heard and was glad . the daughters of Judah rejoiced , because of your judgments , Yahweh .
you who love Yahweh , hate evil . he preserves the souls of his saints . he delivers them out of the hand of the wicked .
light is sown for the righteous , and gladness for the upright in heart .
< < A Psalm . > > sing to Yahweh a new song , for he has done marvelous things ! his right hand , and his holy arm , have worked salvation for him .
Yahweh has made known his salvation . he has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations .
he has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel . all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
make a joyful noise to Yahweh , all the earth ! burst out and sing for joy , yes , sing praises !
sing praises to Yahweh with the harp , with the harp and the voice of melody .
with trumpets and sound of the ram 's Horn , make a joyful noise before the King , Yahweh .
let the sea roar with its fullness ; the world , and those who dwell therein .
let the rivers clap their hands . let the mountains sing for joy together .
Moses and Aaron were among his priests , Samuel among those who call on his name ; they called on Yahweh , and he answered them .
he spoke to them in the pillar of cloud . they kept his testimonies , the statute that he gave them .
< < A Psalm of Thanksgiving . > > shout for joy to Yahweh , all you lands !
know that Yahweh , he is God . it is he who has made us , and we are his . we are his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
< < A Psalm by David . > > I will sing of loving kindness and justice . to you , Yahweh , I will sing praises .
I will be careful to live a blameless life . when will you come to me ? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart .
I will set no vile thing before my eyes . I hate the deeds of Faithless men . they will not cling to me .
a perverse heart will be far from me . I will have nothing to do with evil .
I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor . I won 't tolerate one who is haughty and conceited .
my eyes will be on the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with me . he who walks in a perfect way , he will serve me .
he who practices deceit won 't dwell within my house . he who speaks falsehood won 't be established before my eyes .
morning by morning , I will destroy all the wicked of the land ; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh 's city .
Don 't hide your face from me in the day of my distress . turn your ear to me . answer me quickly in the day when I call .
my heart is blighted like grass , and withered , for I forget to eat my bread .
by reason of the voice of my groaning , my bones stick to my skin .
I am like a pelican of the wilderness . I have become as an owl of the waste places .
you will arise and have mercy on Zion ; for it is time to have pity on her . yes , the set time has come .
for your servants take pleasure in her stones , and have pity on her dust .
so the nations will fear the name of Yahweh ; all the kings of the earth your glory .
he has responded to the prayer of the destitute , and has not despised their prayer .
for he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary . from heaven , Yahweh saw the earth ;
to hear the groans of the prisoner ; to free those who are condemned to death ;
of old , you laid the foundation of the earth . the heavens are the work of your hands .
they will perish , but you will endure . yes , all of them will wear out like a garment . you will change them like a cloak , and they will be changed .
< < By David . > > Praise Yahweh , my soul ! all that is within me , praise his holy name !
he made known his ways to Moses , his deeds to the children of Israel .
he has not dealt with us according to our sins , nor repaid us for our iniquities .
for as the heavens are high above the earth , so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him .
as far as the east is from the west , so far has he removed our transgressions from us .
for he knows how we are made . he remembers that we are dust .
as for man , his days are like grass . as a flower of the field , so he flourishes .
for the wind passes over it , and it is gone . its place remembers it no more .
praise Yahweh , you angels of his , who are mighty in strength , who fulfill his word , obeying the voice of his word .
he lays the beams of his rooms in the waters . he makes the clouds his chariot . he walks on the wings of the wind .
he makes his messengers winds ; his servants flames of fire .
he laid the foundations of the earth , that it should not be moved forever .
at your rebuke they fled . at the voice of your Thunder they hurried away .
the mountains rose , the valleys sank down , to the place which you had assigned to them .
you have set a boundary that they may not pass over ; that they don 't turn again to cover the earth .
he sends forth springs into the valleys . they run among the mountains .
they give drink to every animal of the field . the wild donkeys quench their thirst .
the birds of the sky nest by them . they sing among the branches .
he waters the mountains from his rooms . the earth is filled with the fruit of your works .
he causes the grass to grow for the livestock , and plants for man to cultivate , that he may bring forth food out of the earth :
wine that makes glad the heart of man , oil to make his face to shine , and bread that strengthens man 's heart .
Yahweh 's trees are well watered , the cedars of Lebanon , which he has planted ;
where the birds make their nests . the stork makes its home in the fir trees .
the high mountains are for the wild goats . the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers .
you make darkness , and it is night , in which all the animals of the forest prowl .
the sun rises , and they steal away , and lay down in their dens .
Yahweh , how many are your works ! in wisdom have you made them all . the earth is full of your riches .
there is the sea , great and wide , in which are innumerable living things , both small and large animals .
these all wait for you , that you may give them their food in due season .
you give to them ; they gather . you open your hand ; they are satisfied with good .
you hide your face : they are troubled ; you take away their breath : they die , and return to the dust .
you send forth your Spirit : they are created . you renew the face of the ground .
he looks at the earth , and it trembles . he touches the mountains , and they smoke .
I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live . I will sing praise to my God while I have any being .
give thanks to Yahweh ! call on his name ! make his doings known among the peoples .
sing to him , sing praises to him ! tell of all his marvelous works .
glory in his holy name . let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice .
and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute ; to Israel for an everlasting Covenant ,
when they were but a few men in number , yes , very few , and foreigners in it .
he called for a famine on the land . he destroyed the food supplies .
until the time that his word happened , and Yahweh 's word proved him true .
the king sent and freed him ; even the ruler of peoples , and let him go free .
he made him lord of his house , and ruler of all of his possessions ;
he sent Moses , his servant , and Aaron , whom he had chosen .
their land swarmed with frogs , even in the rooms of their kings .
he struck their vines and also their fig trees , and shattered the trees of their country .
he spoke , and the locusts came , and the grasshoppers , without number ,
ate up every plant in their land ; and ate up the fruit of their ground .
he struck also all the firstborn in their land , the first fruits of all their manhood .
he brought them forth with silver and gold . there was not one feeble person among his tribes .
they asked , and he brought quails , and satisfied them with the bread of the sky .
he opened the rock , and waters gushed out . they ran as a river in the dry places .
he gave them the lands of the nations . they took the labor of the peoples in possession ,
blessed are those who keep justice . blessed is one who does what is right at all times .
remember me , Yahweh , with the favor that you show to your people . visit me with your salvation ,
that I may see the prosperity of your chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation , that I may glory with your inheritance .
our fathers didn 't understand your wonders in Egypt . they didn 't remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses , but were rebellious at the sea , even at the Red Sea .
nevertheless he saved them for his name 's sake , that he might make his mighty power known .
he rebuked the Red Sea also , and it was dried up ; so he led them through the depths , as through a desert .
he saved them from the hand of him who hated them , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
the waters covered their adversaries . there was not one of them left .
but gave in to craving in the desert , and tested God in the wasteland .
a fire was kindled in their company . the flame burned up the wicked .
thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass .
therefore he said that he would destroy them , had Moses , his chosen , not stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wrath , so that he wouldn 't destroy them .
but murmured in their tents , and didn 't listen to Yahweh 's voice .
therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness ,
thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds . the plague broke in on them .
then Phinehas stood up , and executed judgment , so the plague was stopped .
because they were rebellious against his spirit , he spoke rashly with his lips .
they shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan . the land was polluted with blood .
their enemies also oppressed them . they were brought into subjection under their hand .
many times he delivered them , but they were rebellious in their counsel , and were brought low in their iniquity .
he remembered for them his Covenant , and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses .
he made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive .
save us , Yahweh , our God , gather us from among the nations , to give thanks to your holy name , to triumph in your praise !
let the redeemed by Yahweh say so , whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary ,
and gathered out of the lands , from the east and from the west , from the north and from the south .
they wandered in the wilderness in a desert way . they found no city to live in .
then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble , and he delivered them out of their distresses ,
he led them also by a straight way , that they might go to a city to live in .
let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful works to the children of men !
because they rebelled against the words of God , and condemned the counsel of the Most High .
therefore he brought down their heart with labor . they fell down , and there was none to help .
then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble , and he saved them out of their distresses .
he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death , and broke their bonds in sunder .
let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful works to the children of men !
for he has broken the gates of brass , and cut through bars of iron .
their soul abhors all kinds of food . they draw near to the gates of death .
he sends his word , and heals them , and delivers them from their graves .
let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful works to the children of men !
those who go down to the sea in ships , who do business in great waters ;
they mount up to the sky ; they go down again to the depths . their soul melts away because of trouble .
they reel back and forth , and stagger like a drunken man , and are at their wits ' end .
then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble , and he brings them out of their distress .
he makes the storm a calm , so that its waves are still .
then they are glad because it is calm , so he brings them to their desired haven .
let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful works for the children of men !
let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people , and praise him in the seat of the elders .
he turns rivers into a desert , water springs into a thirsty ground ,
and a fruitful land into a salt waste , for the wickedness of those who dwell in it .
he turns a desert into a pool of water , and a dry land into water springs .
there he makes the hungry live , that they may prepare a city to live in ,
he blesses them also , so that they are multiplied greatly . he doesn 't allow their livestock to decrease .
yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction , and increases their families like a flock .
the upright will see it , and be glad . all the wicked will shut their mouths .
I will give thanks to you , Yahweh , among the nations . I will sing praises to you among the peoples .
for your loving kindness is great above the heavens . your faithfulness reaches to the skies .
God has spoken from his sanctuary : " in triumph , I will divide Shechem , and measure out the valley of Succoth .
Gilead is mine . Manasseh is mine . Ephraim also is my helmet . Judah is my scepter .
haven 't you rejected us , God ? you don 't go forth , God , with our armies .
through God , we will do valiantly . for it is he who will tread down our enemies .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > God of my praise , don 't remain silent ,
for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me . they have spoken to me with a lying tongue .
they have also surrounded me with words of hatred , and fought against me without a cause .
they have rewarded me evil for good , and hatred for my love .
when he is judged , let him come forth guilty . let his prayer be turned into sin .
let the creditor seize all that he has . let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor .
let there be no one to extend kindness to him , neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children .
let his posterity be cut off . in the generation following let their name be blotted out .
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh . Don 't let the sin of his mother be blotted out .
let them be before Yahweh continually , that he may cut off their memory from the earth ;
because he didn 't remember to show kindness , but persecuted the poor and needy man , the broken in heart , to kill them .
yes , he loved cursing , and it came to him . he didn 't delight in blessing , and it was far from him .
he clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment . it came into his inward parts like water , like oil into his bones .
let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself , for the belt that is always around him .
this is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh , of those who speak evil against my soul .
I have also become a reproach to them . when they see me , they shake their head .
they may curse , but you bless . when they arise , they will be shamed , but your servant shall rejoice .
let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor . let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe .
I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth . yes , I will praise him among the multitude .
for he will stand at the right hand of the needy , to save him from those who judge his soul .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh says to my Lord , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet . "
Yahweh will send forth the rod of your strength out of Zion . rule in the midst of your enemies .
your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power , in holy array . out of the womb of the morning , you have the dew of your youth .
he will judge among the nations . he will heap up dead bodies . he will crush the ruler of the whole earth .
he will drink of the Brook in the way ; therefore he will lift up his head .
praise Yah ! I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart , in the council of the upright , and in the Congregation .
he has caused his wonderful works to be remembered . Yahweh is gracious and merciful .
he has given food to those who fear him . he always remembers his Covenant .
he has shown his people the power of his works , in giving them the heritage of the nations .
he has sent redemption to his people . he has ordained his Covenant forever . his name is holy and awesome !
his seed will be mighty in the land . the generation of the upright will be blessed .
it is well with the man who deals graciously and lends . he will maintain his cause in judgment .
he will not be afraid of evil news . his heart is steadfast , trusting in Yahweh .
his heart is established . he will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries .
he has dispersed , he has given to the poor . his righteousness endures forever . his Horn will be exalted with honor .
the wicked will see it , and be grieved . he shall gnash with his teeth , and melt away . the desire of the wicked will perish .
blessed be the name of Yahweh , from this time forth and forevermore .
from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same , Yahweh 's name is to be praised .
who is like Yahweh , our God , who has his seat on high ,
he raises up the poor out of the dust . lifts up the needy from the ash heap ;
that he may set him with princes , even with the princes of his people .
when Israel went forth out of Egypt , the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language ;
not to us , Yahweh , not to us , but to your name give glory , for your loving kindness , and for your truth 's sake .
but our God is in the heavens . he does whatever he pleases .
they have mouths , but they don 't speak . they have eyes , but they don 't see .
they have ears , but they don 't hear . they have noses , but they don 't smell .
those who make them will be like them ; yes , everyone who trusts in them .
Yahweh remembers us . he will bless us . he will bless the house of Israel . he will bless the house of Aaron .
the heavens are the heavens of Yahweh ; but the earth has he given to the children of men .
I love Yahweh , because he listens to my voice , and my cries for mercy .
because he has turned his ear to me , therefore I will call on him as long as I live .
the cords of death surrounded me , the pains of Sheol got a hold of me . I found trouble and sorrow .
I will take the cup of salvation , and call on the name of Yahweh .
I will pay my vows to Yahweh , yes , in the presence of all his people .
precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his saints .
Yahweh , truly I am your servant . I am your servant , the son of your handmaid . you have freed me from my chains .
I will pay my vows to Yahweh , yes , in the presence of all his people ,
Yahweh is on my side . I will not be afraid . what can man do to me ?
Yahweh is on my side among those who help me . therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me .
it is better to take refuge in Yahweh , than to put confidence in man .
it is better to take refuge in Yahweh , than to put confidence in princes .
all the nations surrounded me , but in the name of Yahweh , I cut them off .
they surrounded me , yes , they surrounded me . in the name of Yahweh I indeed cut them off .
they surrounded me like bees . they are quenched like the burning thorns . in the name of Yahweh I cut them off .
the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous . " the right hand of Yahweh does valiantly .
I will not die , but live , and declare Yah 's works .
open to me the gates of righteousness . I will enter into them . I will give thanks to Yah .
I will give thanks to you , for you have answered me , and have become my salvation .
this is the day that Yahweh has made . we will rejoice and be glad in it !

you are my God , and I will give thanks to you . you are my God , I will exalt you .
you have commanded your precepts , that we should fully obey them .
then I wouldn 't be disappointed , when I consider all of your commandments .
I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart , when I learn your righteous judgments .

< < A Song of Ascents . > > In my distress , I cried to Yahweh . he answered me .
what will be given to you , and what will be done more to you , you deceitful tongue ?
< < A Song of Ascents . > > I will lift up my eyes to the hills . where does my help come from ?
he will not allow your foot to be moved . he who keeps you will not slumber .
the sun will not harm you by day , nor the moon by night .
Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in , from this time forth , and forevermore .
Jerusalem , that is built as a city that is compact together ;
where the tribes go up , even Yah 's tribes , according to an ordinance for Israel , to give thanks to the name of Yahweh .
for the sake of the house of Yahweh our God , I will seek your good .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > To you I do lift up my eyes , you who sit in the heavens .
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease , with the contempt of the proud .
< < A Song of Ascents . by David . > > If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side , let Israel now say ,
if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side , when men rose up against us ;
then they would have swallowed us up alive , when their wrath was kindled against us ;
then the waters would have overwhelmed us , the stream would have gone over our soul ;
then the proud waters would have gone over our soul .
blessed be Yahweh , who has not given us as a prey to their teeth .
our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler 's snare . the snare is broken , and we have escaped .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion , which can 't be moved , but remains forever .
for the scepter of wickedness won 't remain over the allotment of the righteous ; so that the righteous won 't use their hands to do evil .
do good , Yahweh , to those who are good , to those who are upright in their hearts .
but as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways , Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity . peace be on Israel .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion , we were like those who dream .
he who goes out weeping , carrying seed for sowing , will certainly come again with joy , carrying his sheaves .
it is vain for you to rise up early , to stay up late , eating the bread of toil ; for he gives sleep to his loved ones .
behold , children are a heritage of Yahweh . the fruit of the womb is his reward .
as arrows in the hand of a mighty man , so are the children of youth .
happy is the man who has his quiver full of them . they won 't be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh , who walks in his ways .
for you will eat the labor of your hands . you will be happy , and it will be well with you .
your wife will be as a fruitful vine , in the innermost parts of your house ; your children like olive plants , around your table .
May Yahweh bless you out of Zion , and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up . let Israel now say ,
many times they have afflicted me from my youth up , yet they have not prevailed against me .
Yahweh is righteous . he has cut apart the cords of the wicked .
let them be as the grass on the housetops , which Withers before it grows up ;
with which the reaper doesn 't fill his hand , nor he who binds sheaves , his bosom .
neither do those who go by say , " The blessing of Yahweh be on you . we bless you in the name of Yahweh . "
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Out of the depths I have cried to you , Yahweh .
Lord , hear my voice . let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions .
my soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning ; more than watchmen for the morning .
surely I have stilled and quieted my soul , like a weaned child with his mother , like a weaned child is my soul within me .
" surely I will not come into the structure of my house , nor go up into my bed ;
I will not give sleep to my eyes , or slumber to my eyelids ;
behold , we heard of it in Ephrathah . we found it in the field of Jaar :
for your servant David 's sake , don 't turn away the face of your anointed one .
Yahweh has sworn to David in truth . he will not turn from it : " I will set the fruit of your body on your throne .
if your children will keep my Covenant , my testimony that I will teach them , their children also will sit on your throne forevermore . "
I will abundantly bless her provision . I will satisfy her poor with bread .
her priests I will also clothe with salvation . her saints will shout aloud for joy .
I will clothe his enemies with shame , but on himself , his crown will be resplendent . "
< < A Song of Ascents . by David . > > See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity !
it is like the precious oil on the head , that ran down on the beard , even Aaron 's beard ; that came down on the edge of his robes ;
like the dew of Hermon , that comes down on the hills of Zion : for there Yahweh gives the blessing , even life forevermore .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Look ! praise Yahweh , all you servants of Yahweh , who stand by night in Yahweh 's house !
praise Yah ! praise the name of Yahweh ! praise him , you servants of Yahweh ,
whatever Yahweh pleased , that he has done , in heaven and in earth , in the seas and in all deeps ;
who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth ; who makes lightnings with the rain ; who brings forth the wind out of his treasuries ;
who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you , Egypt , on Pharaoh , and on all his servants ;
for Yahweh will judge his people , and have compassion on his servants .
they have mouths , but they can 't speak . they have eyes , but they can 't see .
they have ears , but they can 't hear ; neither is there any breath in their mouths .
those who make them will be like them ; yes , everyone who trusts in them .
give thanks to the God of gods ; for his loving kindness endures forever .
to him who by understanding made the heavens ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who spread out the earth above the waters ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who made the great lights ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who struck down the Egyptian firstborn ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
to him who divided the Red Sea apart ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
and made Israel to pass through its midst ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who led his people through the wilderness ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
to him who struck great kings ; for his loving kindness endures forever ;
and has delivered us from our adversaries ; for his loving kindness endures forever :
by the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down . yes , we wept , when we remembered Zion .
on the willows in its midst , we hung up our harps .
for there , those who led us captive asked us for songs . those who tormented us demanded songs of joy : " sing us one of the songs of Zion ! "
let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don 't remember you ; if I don 't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy .
remember , Yahweh , against the children of Edom , the day of Jerusalem ; who said , " raze it ! raze it even to its foundation ! "
daughter of Babylon , doomed to destruction , he will be happy who rewards you , as you have served us .
happy shall he be , who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock .
< < By David . > > I will give you thanks with my whole heart . before the gods , I will sing praises to you .
I will bow down toward your holy temple , and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth ; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all .
in the day that I called , you answered me . you encouraged me with strength in my soul .
all the kings of the earth will give you thanks , Yahweh , for they have heard the words of your mouth .
yes , they will sing of the ways of Yahweh ; for great is Yahweh 's glory .
for though Yahweh is high , yet he looks after the lowly ; but the proud , he knows from afar .
though I walk in the midst of trouble , you will revive me . you will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies . your right hand will save me .
Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me ; your loving kindness , Yahweh , endures forever . Don 't forsake the works of your own hands .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , you have searched me , and you know me .
you know my sitting down and my rising up . you perceive my thoughts from afar .
for there is not a word on my tongue , but , behold , Yahweh , you know it altogether .
you hem me in behind and before . you laid your hand on me .
this knowledge is beyond me . it 's lofty . I can 't attain it .
where could I go from your Spirit ? or where could I flee from your presence ?
if I ascend up into heaven , you are there . if I make my bed in Sheol , behold , you are there !
if I take the wings of the dawn , and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea ;
for you formed my inmost being . you knit me together in my mother 's womb .
I will give thanks to you , for I am fearfully and wonderfully made . your works are wonderful . my soul knows that very well .
my frame wasn 't hidden from you , when I was made in secret , woven together in the depths of the earth .
your eyes saw my body . in your book they were all written , the days that were ordained for me , when as yet there were none of them .
if I would count them , they are more in number than the sand . when I wake up , I am still with you .
Yahweh , don 't I hate those who hate you ? am I not grieved with those who rise up against you ?
those who devise mischief in their hearts . they continually gather themselves together for war .
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent . Viper 's poison is under their lips . Selah .
Yahweh , keep me from the hands of the wicked . preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet .
the proud have hidden a snare for me , they have spread the cords of a net by the path . they have set traps for me . Selah .
Yahweh , the Lord , the strength of my salvation , you have covered my head in the day of battle .
Yahweh , don 't grant the desires of the wicked . Don 't let their evil plans succeed , or they will become proud . Selah .
as for the head of those who surround me , let the mischief of their own lips cover them .
let burning coals fall on them . let them be thrown into the fire , into miry pits , from where they never rise .
an evil speaker won 't be established in the earth . evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him .
I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted , and justice for the needy .
surely the righteous will give thanks to your name . the upright will dwell in your presence .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , I have called on you . come to me quickly ! listen to my voice when I call to you .
let my prayer be set before you like incense ; the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice .
set a watch , Yahweh , before my mouth . keep the door of my lips .
Don 't incline my heart to any evil thing , to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity . Don 't let me eat of their delicacies .
their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock . they will hear my words , for they are well spoken .
" as when one plows and breaks up the earth , our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol . "
for my eyes are on you , Yahweh , the Lord . in you , I take refuge . Don 't leave my soul destitute .
keep me from the snare which they have laid for me , from the traps of the workers of iniquity .
< < A contemplation by David , when he was in the cave . a Prayer . > > I cry with my voice to Yahweh . with my voice , I ask Yahweh for mercy .
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me , you knew my path . in the way in which I walk , they have hidden a snare for me .
look on my right , and see ; for there is no one who is concerned for me . refuge has fled from me . no one cares for my soul .
I cried to you , Yahweh . I said , " You are my refuge , my portion in the land of the living . "
listen to my cry , for I am in desperate need. deliver me from my persecutors , For they are stronger than me .
bring my soul out of prison , that I may give thanks to your name . the righteous will surround me , for you will be good to me .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Hear my prayer , Yahweh . listen to my petitions . in your faithfulness and righteousness , relieve me .
Don 't enter into judgment with your servant , for in your sight no man living is righteous .
for the enemy pursues my soul . he has struck my life down to the ground . he has made me live in dark places , as those who have been long dead .
therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me . my heart within me is desolate .
I remember the days of old . I meditate on all your doings . I contemplate the work of your hands .
I spread forth my hands to you . my soul thirsts for you , like a parched land . Selah .
hurry to answer me , Yahweh . my spirit fails . Don 't hide your face from me , so that I don 't become like those who go down into the pit .
deliver me , Yahweh , from my enemies . I flee to you to hide me .
teach me to do your will , for you are my God . your Spirit is good . lead me in the land of uprightness .
revive me , Yahweh , for your name 's sake . in your righteousness , bring my soul out of trouble .
in your loving kindness , cut off my enemies , and destroy all those who afflict my soul , For I am your servant .
< < By David . > > blessed be Yahweh , my rock , who teaches my hands to war , and my fingers to battle :
my loving kindness , my fortress , my high tower , my deliverer , my shield , and he in whom I take refuge ; who subdues my people under me .
Yahweh , what is man , that you care for him ? or the son of man , that you think of him ?
stretch out your hand from above , rescue me , and deliver me out of great waters , out of the hands of foreigners ;
you are he who gives salvation to kings , who rescues David , his servant , from the deadly sword .
rescue me , and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners , whose mouths speak deceit , whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood .
our barns are full , filled with all kinds of provision . our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields .
our oxen will pull heavy loads . there is no breaking in , and no going away , and no outcry in our streets .
happy are the people who are in such a situation . happy are the people whose God is Yahweh .
one generation will commend your works to another , and will declare your mighty acts .
of the glorious majesty of your honor , of your wondrous works , I will meditate .
they will utter the memory of your great Goodness , and will sing of your righteousness .
they will speak of the glory of your kingdom , and talk about your power ;
to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts , the glory of the majesty of his kingdom .
your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom . your dominion endures throughout all generations . Yahweh is faithful in all his words , and loving in all his deeds .
the eyes of all wait for you . you give them their food in due season .
Yahweh is near to all those who call on him , to all who call on him in truth .
he will fulfill the desire of those who fear him . he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
while I live , I will praise Yahweh . I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist .
Don 't put your trust in princes , each a son of man in whom there is no help .
his spirit departs , and he returns to the earth . in that very day , his thoughts perish .
happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help , whose hope is in Yahweh , his God :
who made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that is in them ; who keeps truth forever ;
Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind . Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down . Yahweh loves the righteous .
Yahweh preserves the foreigners . he upholds the fatherless and widow , but the way of the wicked he turns Upside down .
he counts the number of the stars . he calls them all by their names .
great is our Lord , and mighty in power . his understanding is infinite .
who covers the sky with clouds , who prepares rain for the earth , who makes grass grow on the mountains .
he provides food for the livestock , and for the young ravens when they call .
he doesn 't delight in the strength of the horse . he takes no pleasure in the legs of a man .
Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him , in those who hope in his loving kindness .
for he has strengthened the bars of your gates . he has blessed your children within you .
he makes peace in your borders . he fills you with the finest of the wheat .
he sends out his commandment to the earth . his word runs very swiftly .
he sends out his word , and melts them . he causes his wind to blow , and the waters flow .
he has also established them forever and ever . he has made a decree which will not pass away .
let them praise the name of Yahweh , for his name alone is exalted . his glory is above the earth and the heavens .
he has lifted up the Horn of his people , the praise of all his saints ; even of the children of Israel , a people near to him . praise Yah !
let Israel rejoice in him who made them . let the children of Zion be joyful in their King .
May the high praises of God be in their mouths , and a two @-@ edged sword in their hand ;
to bind their kings with chains , and their nobles with fetters of iron ;
the Proverbs of Solomon , the son of David , king of Israel :
the fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge ; but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction .
my son , listen to your father 's instruction , and don 't forsake your mother 's teaching :
let 's swallow them up alive like Sheol , and whole , like those who go down into the pit .
my son , don 't walk in the way with them . keep your foot from their path ,
for in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird :
so are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain . it takes away the life of its owners .
wisdom calls aloud in the street . she utters her voice in the public squares .
she calls at the head of noisy places . at the entrance of the city gates , she utters her words :
turn at my reproof . behold , I will pour out my spirit on you . I will make known my words to you .
because I have called , and you have refused ; I have stretched out my hand , and no one has paid attention ;
but you have ignored all my counsel , and wanted none of my reproof ;
I also will laugh at your disaster . I will mock when calamity overtakes you ;
then will they call on me , but I will not answer . they will seek me diligently , but they will not find me ;
they wanted none of my counsel . they despised all my reproof .
therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way , and be filled with their own schemes .
for the backsliding of the simple will kill them . the careless ease of fools will destroy them .
but whoever listens to me will dwell securely , and will be at ease , without fear of harm . "
yes , if you call out for discernment , and lift up your voice for understanding ;
then you will understand the fear of Yahweh , and find the knowledge of God .
he lays up sound wisdom for the upright . he is a shield to those who walk in integrity ;
that he may guard the paths of justice , and preserve the way of his saints .
for wisdom will enter into your heart . knowledge will be pleasant to your soul .
to deliver you from the way of evil , from the men who speak perverse things ;
who are crooked in their ways , and wayward in their paths :
none who go to her return again , neither do they attain to the paths of life :
that you may walk in the way of good men , and keep the paths of the righteous .
but the wicked will be cut off from the land . the treacherous will be rooted out of it .
for length of days , and years of life , and peace , will they add to you .
Don 't let kindness and truth forsake you . bind them around your neck . write them on the tablet of your heart .
so you will find favor , and good understanding in the sight of God and man .
trust in Yahweh with all your heart , and don 't lean on your own understanding .
it will be health to your body , and nourishment to your bones .
honor Yahweh with your substance , with the first fruits of all your increase :
for whom Yahweh loves , he reproves ; even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights .
happy is the man who finds wisdom , the man who gets understanding .
for her good profit is better than getting silver , and her return is better than fine gold .
she is more precious than rubies . none of the things you can desire are to be compared to her .
she is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her . happy is everyone who retains her .
by his knowledge , the depths were broken up , and the skies drop down the dew .
when you lie down , you will not be afraid . yes , you will lie down , and your sleep will be sweet .
Don 't be afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it comes :
Don 't withhold good from those to whom it is due , when it is in the power of your hand to do it .
Don 't say to your neighbor , " Go , and come again ; tomorrow I will give it to you , " when you have it by you .
Don 't devise evil against your neighbor , since he dwells securely by you .
Don 't strive with a man without cause , if he has done you no harm .
for the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh , but his friendship is with the upright .
Yahweh 's curse is in the house of the wicked , but he blesses the habitation of the righteous .
for I was a son to my father , tender and an only child in the sight of my mother .
he taught me , and said to me : " let your heart retain my words . keep my commandments , and live .
get wisdom . get understanding . Don 't forget , neither swerve from the words of my mouth .
Don 't forsake her , and she will preserve you . love her , and she will keep you .
esteem her , and she will exalt you . she will bring you to honor , when you embrace her .
she will give to your head a garland of grace . she will deliver a crown of splendor to you . "
listen , my son , and receive my sayings . the years of your life will be many .
I have taught you in the way of wisdom . I have led you in straight paths .
when you go , your steps will not be hampered . when you run , you will not stumble .
take firm hold of instruction . Don 't let her go . keep her , for she is your life .
Don 't enter into the path of the wicked . Don 't walk in the way of evil men .
avoid it , and don 't pass by it . turn from it , and pass on .
for they don 't sleep , unless they do evil . their sleep is taken away , unless they make someone fall .
for they eat the bread of wickedness , and drink the wine of violence .
but the path of the righteous is like the dawning light , that shines more and more until the perfect day .
the way of the wicked is like darkness . they don 't know what they stumble over .
let them not depart from your eyes . keep them in the midst of your heart .
for they are life to those who find them , and health to their whole body .
Don 't turn to the right hand nor to the left . remove your foot from evil .
but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood , and as sharp as a two @-@ edged sword .
she gives no thought to the way of life . her ways are crooked , and she doesn 't know it .
now therefore , my sons , listen to me . Don 't depart from the words of my mouth .
remove your way far from her . Don 't come near the door of her house ,
lest you give your honor to others , and your years to the cruel one ;
you will groan at your latter end , when your flesh and your body are consumed ,
neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor turned my ear to those who instructed me !
I have come to the brink of utter ruin , in the midst of the gathered assembly . "
drink water out of your own cistern , running water out of your own well .
should your springs overflow in the streets , streams of water in the public squares ?
for the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh . he examines all his paths .
he will die for lack of instruction . in the greatness of his Folly , he will go astray .
my son , if you have become collateral for your neighbor , if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger ;
you are trapped by the words of your mouth . you are ensnared with the words of your mouth .
do this now , my son , and deliver yourself , since you have come into the hand of your neighbor . go , humble yourself . press your plea with your neighbor .
free yourself , like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter , like a bird from the snare of the fowler .
provides her bread in the summer , and gathers her food in the harvest .
a worthless person , a man of iniquity , is he who walks with a perverse mouth ;
in whose heart is perverseness , who devises evil continually , who always sows discord .
therefore his calamity will come suddenly . he will be broken suddenly , and that without remedy .
there are six things which Yahweh hates ; yes , seven which are an abomination to him :
a heart that devises wicked schemes , feet that are swift in running to mischief ,
my son , keep your father 's commandment , and don 't forsake your mother 's teaching .
when you walk , it will lead you . when you sleep , it will watch over you . when you awake , it will talk with you .
for the commandment is a lamp , and the law is light . Reproofs of instruction are the way of life ,
Don 't lust after her beauty in your heart , neither let her captivate you with her eyelids .
or can one walk on hot coals , and his feet not be scorched ?
so is he who goes in to his neighbor 's wife . whoever touches her will not be unpunished .
men don 't despise a thief , if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry :
but if he is found , he shall restore seven times . he shall give all the wealth of his house .
he who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding . he who does it destroys his own soul .
for jealousy arouses the fury of the husband . he won 't spare in the day of vengeance .
he won 't regard any ransom , neither will he rest content , though you give many gifts .
that they may keep you from the strange woman , from the foreigner who flatters with her words .
for at the window of my house , I looked out through my lattice .
I saw among the simple ones . I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding ,
behold , there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute , and with crafty intent .
now she is in the streets , now in the squares , and lurking at every corner .
so she caught him , and kissed him . with an impudent face she said to him :
therefore I came out to meet you , to diligently seek your face , and I have found you .
I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry , with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt .
for my husband isn 't at home . he has gone on a long journey .
he has taken a bag of money with him . he will come home at the full moon . "
with persuasive words , she led him astray . with the flattering of her lips , she seduced him .
he followed her immediately , as an ox goes to the slaughter , as a fool stepping into a noose .
until an arrow strikes through his liver , as a bird hurries to the snare , and doesn 't know that it will cost his life .
now therefore , sons , listen to me . pay attention to the words of my mouth .
Don 't let your heart turn to her ways . Don 't go astray in her paths ,
Doesn 't wisdom cry out ? Doesn 't understanding raise her voice ?
on the top of high places by the way , where the paths meet , she stands .
beside the gates , at the entry of the city , at the entry doors , she cries aloud :
" to you men , I call ! I send my voice to the sons of mankind .
hear , for I will speak excellent things . the opening of my lips is for right things .
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness . there is nothing crooked or perverse in them .
for wisdom is better than rubies . all the things that may be desired can 't be compared to it .
by me princes rule ; nobles , and all the righteous rulers of the earth .
my fruit is better than gold , yes , than fine gold ; my yield than choice silver .
I walk in the way of righteousness , in the midst of the paths of justice ;
" Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work , before his deeds of old .
when there were no depths , I was brought forth , when there were no springs abounding with water .
when he established the heavens , I was there ; when he set a circle on the surface of the deep ,
when he established the clouds above , when the springs of the deep became strong ,
when he gave to the sea its boundary , that the waters should not violate his commandment , when he marked out the foundations of the earth ;
Rejoicing in his whole world . my delight was with the sons of men .
" now therefore , my sons , listen to me , for blessed are those who keep my ways .
she has prepared her meat . she has mixed her wine . she has also set her table .
she has sent out her maidens . she cries from the highest places of the city :
Don 't reprove a scoffer , lest he hate you . Reprove a wise man , and he will love you .
instruct a wise man , and he will be still wiser . teach a righteous man , and he will increase in learning .
the fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom . the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding .
for by me your days will be multiplied . the years of your life will be increased .
if you are wise , you are wise for yourself . if you mock , you alone will bear it .
" whoever is simple , let him turn in here . " as for him who is void of understanding , she says to him ,
the Proverbs of Solomon . a wise son makes a glad father ; but a foolish son brings grief to his mother .
Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry , but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked .
he becomes poor who works with a lazy hand , but the hand of the diligent brings wealth .

there are those who covet greedily all day long ; but the righteous give and don 't withhold .
the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination : how much more , when he brings it with a wicked mind !
a good name is more desirable than great riches , and loving favor is better than silver and gold .
the rich and the poor have this in common : Yahweh is the maker of them all .
a prudent man sees danger , and hides himself ; but the simple pass on , and suffer for it .
train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not depart from it .
he who sows wickedness reaps trouble , and the rod of his fury will be destroyed .
he who has a generous eye will be blessed ; for he shares his food with the poor .
drive out the mocker , and strife will go out ; yes , quarrels and insults will stop .
the eyes of Yahweh watch over knowledge ; but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful .
the mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit : he who is under Yahweh 's wrath will fall into it .
Folly is bound up in the heart of a child : the rod of discipline drives it far from him .
whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich , both come to poverty .
turn your ear , and listen to the words of the wise . apply your heart to my teaching .
for it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you , if all of them are ready on your lips .
for Yahweh will plead their case , and plunder the life of those who plunder them .
Don 't befriend a hot @-@ tempered man , and don 't associate with one who harbors anger :
Don 't you be one of those who strike hands , of those who are collateral for debts .
if you don 't have means to pay , why should he take away your bed from under you ?
Don 't move the ancient boundary stone , which your fathers have set up .
do you see a man skilled in his work ? he will serve kings . he won 't serve obscure men .
when you sit to eat with a ruler , consider diligently what is before you ;
put a knife to your throat , if you are a man given to appetite .
why do you set your eyes on that which is not ? for it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky .
Don 't eat the food of him who has a stingy eye , and don 't crave his delicacies :
for as he thinks about the cost , so he is . " eat and drink ! " he says to you , but his heart is not with you .
Don 't speak in the ears of a fool , for he will despise the wisdom of your words .
Don 't move the ancient boundary stone . Don 't encroach on the fields of the fatherless :
Don 't withhold correction from a child . if you punish him with the rod , he will not die .
my son , if your heart is wise , then my heart will be glad , even mine :
yes , my heart will rejoice , when your lips speak what is right .
Don 't let your heart envy sinners ; but rather fear Yahweh all the day long .
indeed surely there is a future hope , and your hope will not be cut off .
Don 't be among ones drinking too much wine , or those who gorge themselves on meat :
listen to your father who gave you life , and don 't despise your mother when she is old .
let your father and your mother be glad ! let her who bore you rejoice !
those who stay long at the wine ; those who go to seek out mixed wine .
Don 't look at the wine when it is red , when it sparkles in the cup , when it goes down smoothly .
in the end , it Bites like a snake , and poisons like a viper .
yes , you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea , or as he who lies on top of the rigging :
" they hit me , and I was not hurt ! they beat me , and I don 't feel it ! when will I wake up ? I can do it again . I can find another . "
Don 't be envious of evil men ; neither desire to be with them :
through wisdom a house is built ; by understanding it is established ;
rescue those who are being led away to death ! indeed , hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter !
my son , eat honey , for it is good ; the droppings of the honeycomb , which are sweet to your taste :
so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul ; if you have found it , then there will be a reward , your hope will not be cut off .
Don 't lay in wait , wicked man , against the habitation of the righteous . Don 't destroy his resting place :
for a righteous man falls seven times , and rises up again ; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity .
Don 't rejoice when your enemy falls . Don 't let your heart be glad when he is overthrown ;
Don 't fret yourself because of evildoers ; neither be envious of the wicked :
for there will be no reward to the evil man ; and the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out .
he who says to the wicked , " You are righteous " ; peoples shall curse him , and nations shall abhor him--
but it will go well with those who convict the guilty , and a rich blessing will come on them .
Don 't be a witness against your neighbor without cause . Don 't deceive with your lips .
Don 't say , " I will do to him as he has done to me ; I will render to the man according to his work . "
I went by the field of the sluggard , by the vineyard of the man void of understanding ;
behold , it was all grown over with thorns . its surface was covered with nettles , and its stone wall was broken down .
then I saw , and considered well . I saw , and received instruction :
it is the glory of God to conceal a thing , but the glory of kings is to search out a matter .
as the heavens for height , and the earth for depth , so the hearts of kings are unsearchable .
take away the dross from the silver , and material comes out for the refiner ;
take away the wicked from the king 's presence , and his throne will be established in righteousness .
Don 't exalt yourself in the presence of the king , or claim a place among great men ;
for it is better that it be said to you , " Come up here , " than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince , whom your eyes have seen .
Don 't be hasty in bringing charges to court . what will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you ?
debate your case with your neighbor , and don 't betray the confidence of another ;
lest one who hears it put you to shame , and your bad reputation never depart .
as the cold of snow in the time of harvest , so is a faithful messenger to those who send him ; for he refreshes the soul of his masters .
have you found honey ? eat as much as is sufficient for you , lest you eat too much , and vomit it .
let your foot be seldom in your neighbor 's house , lest he be weary of you , and hate you .
a man who gives false testimony against his neighbor is like a club , a sword , or a sharp arrow .
as one who takes away a garment in cold weather , or vinegar on soda , so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart .
if your enemy is hungry , give him food to eat . if he is thirsty , give him water to drink :
for you will heap coals of fire on his head , and Yahweh will reward you .
it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop , than to share a house with a contentious woman .
like a muddied spring , and a polluted well , so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked .
it is not good to eat much honey ; nor is it honorable to seek one 's own honor .
like a city that is broken down and without walls is a man whose spirit is without restraint .
like a fluttering sparrow , like a darting swallow , so the undeserved curse doesn 't come to rest .
a whip is for the horse , a bridle for the donkey , and a rod for the back of fools !
answer a fool according to his Folly , lest he be wise in his own eyes .
like the legs of the lame that hang loose : so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
as one who binds a stone in a sling , so is he who gives honor to a fool .
like a thornbush that goes into the hand of a drunkard , so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
as an archer who wounds all , so is he who hires a fool or he who hires those who pass by .
as a dog that returns to his vomit , so is a fool who repeats his Folly .
do you see a man wise in his own eyes ? there is more hope for a fool than for him .
the sluggard buries his hand in the dish . he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth .
like one who grabs a dog 's ears is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own .
like a madman who shoots torches , arrows , and death ,
the words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels , they go down into the innermost parts .
like silver dross on an earthen vessel are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart .
when his speech is charming , don 't believe him ; for there are seven abominations in his heart .
his malice may be concealed by deception , but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly .
whoever digs a pit shall fall into it . whoever rolls a stone , it will come back on him .
Don 't boast about tomorrow ; for you don 't know what a day may bring forth .
let another man praise you , and not your own mouth ; a stranger , and not your own lips .
wrath is cruel , and anger is overwhelming ; but who is able to stand before jealousy ?
as a bird that wanders from her nest , so is a man who wanders from his home .
Don 't forsake your friend and your father 's friend . Don 't go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother .
be wise , my son , and bring joy to my heart , then I can answer my tormentor .
a prudent man sees danger and takes refuge ; but the simple pass on , and suffer for it .
he who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning , it will be taken as a curse by him .
whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit . he who looks after his master shall be honored .
though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain , yet his foolishness will not be removed from him .
know well the state of your flocks , and pay attention to your herds :
for riches are not forever , nor does even the crown endure to all generations .
the hay is removed , and the new growth appears , the grasses of the hills are gathered in .
the lambs are for your clothing , and the goats are the price of a field .
there will be plenty of goats ' milk for your food , for your family 's food , and for the nourishment of your servant girls .
in rebellion , a land has many rulers , but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge .
a needy man who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain which leaves no crops .
those who forsake the law praise the wicked ; but those who keep the law contend with them .
better is the poor who walks in his integrity , than he who is perverse in his ways , and he is rich .
whoever keeps the law is a wise son ; but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father .
he who turns away his ear from hearing the law , even his prayer is an abomination .
whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way , he will fall into his own trap ; but the blameless will inherit good .
the rich man is wise in his own eyes ; but the poor who has understanding sees through him .
when the righteous triumph , there is great glory ; but when the wicked rise , men hide themselves .
he who conceals his sins doesn 't prosper , but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy .
blessed is the man who always fears ; but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble .
a man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death ; no one will support him .
one who works his land will have an abundance of food ; but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty .
a faithful man is rich with blessings ; but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished .
a stingy man hurries after riches , and doesn 't know that poverty waits for him .
one who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than one who flatters with the tongue .
whoever robs his father or his mother , and says , " It 's not wrong . " he is a partner with a destroyer .
one who is greedy stirs up strife ; but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper .
one who trusts in himself is a fool ; but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe .
one who gives to the poor has no lack ; but one who closes his eyes will have many curses .
when the righteous thrive , the people rejoice ; but when the wicked rule , the people groan .
whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father ; but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth .
the king by justice makes the land stable , but he who takes bribes tears it down .
if a wise man goes to court with a foolish man , the fool rages or scoffs , and there is no peace .
a fool vents all of his anger , but a wise man brings himself under control .
the poor man and the oppressor have this in common : Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both .
the king who fairly judges the poor , his throne shall be established forever .
the rod of correction gives wisdom , but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother .
correct your son , and he will give you peace ; yes , he will bring delight to your soul .
a servant can 't be corrected by words . though he understands , yet he will not respond .
do you see a man who is hasty in his words ? there is more hope for a fool than for him .
he who pampers his servant from youth will have him become a son in the end .
a man 's pride brings him low , but one of lowly spirit gains honor .
whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul . he takes an oath , but dares not testify .
the fear of man proves to be a snare , but whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept safe .
a dishonest man detests the righteous , and the upright in their ways detest the wicked .
" surely I am the most ignorant man , and don 't have a man 's understanding .
I have not learned wisdom , neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One .
" every word of God is flawless . he is a shield to those who take refuge in him .
Don 't you add to his words , lest he reprove you , and you be found a liar .
lest I be full , deny you , and say , ' Who is Yahweh ? ' or lest I be poor , and steal , and so dishonor the name of my God .
there is a generation that is pure in their own eyes , yet are not washed from their filthiness .
there is a generation whose teeth are like swords , and their jaws like knives , to devour the poor from the earth , and the needy from among men .
Sheol , the barren womb ; the earth that is not satisfied with water ; and the fire that doesn 't say , ' Enough . '
" the eye that mocks at his father , and scorns obedience to his mother : the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , the young eagles shall eat it .
" there are three things which are too amazing for me , four which I don 't understand :
the way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent on a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maiden .
" so is the way of an adulterous woman : she eats and wipes her mouth , and says , ' I have done nothing wrong . '
" for three things the earth tremble , and under four , it can 't bear up :
for a servant when he is king ; a fool when he is filled with food ;
for an unloved woman when she is married ; and a handmaid who is heir to her mistress .
you can catch a lizard with your hands , yet it is in kings ' palaces .
" there are three things which are stately in their march , four which are stately in going :
the greyhound , the male goat also ; and the king against whom there is no rising up .
" if you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself , or if you have thought evil , put your hand over your mouth .
for as the churning of milk brings forth butter , and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood ; so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife . "
Don 't give your strength to women , nor your ways to that which destroys kings .
it is not for kings , Lemuel ; it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for princes to say , ' Where is strong drink ? '
lest they drink , and forget the law , and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted .
give strong drink to him who is ready to perish ; and wine to the bitter in soul :
open your mouth for the mute , in the cause of all who are left desolate .
the heart of her husband trusts in her . he shall have no lack of gain .
she is like the merchant ships . she brings her bread from afar .
she rises also while it is yet night , gives food to her household , and portions for her servant girls .
she considers a field , and buys it . with the fruit of her hands , she plants a vineyard .
she perceives that her merchandise is profitable . her lamp doesn 't go out by night .
she opens her arms to the poor ; yes , she extends her hands to the needy .
she is not afraid of the snow for her household ; for all her household are clothed with scarlet .
she makes for herself carpets of tapestry . her clothing is fine linen and purple .
her husband is respected in the gates , when he sits among the elders of the land .
she makes linen garments and sells them , and delivers sashes to the merchant .
strength and dignity are her clothing . she laughs at the time to come .
she looks well to the ways of her household , and doesn 't eat the bread of idleness .
charm is deceitful , and beauty is vain ; but a woman who fears Yahweh , she shall be praised .
give her of the fruit of her hands ! let her works praise her in the gates !
the words of the preacher , the son of David , king in Jerusalem :
what does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun ?
the sun also rises , and the sun goes down , and hurries to its place where it rises .
the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north . it turns around continually as it goes , and the wind returns again to its courses .
all the rivers run into the sea , yet the sea is not full . to the place where the rivers flow , there they flow again .
all things are full of weariness beyond uttering . the eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing .
that which has been is that which shall be ; and that which has been done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
is there a thing of which it may be said , " behold , this is new ? " it has been long ago , in the ages which were before us .
there is no memory of the former ; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come , among those that shall come after .
I , the preacher , was king over Israel in Jerusalem .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and behold , all is vanity and a chasing after wind .
that which is crooked can 't be made straight ; and that which is lacking can 't be counted .
I said to myself , " behold , I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem . yes , my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge . "
I made myself pools of water , to water from it the forest where trees were reared .
I bought male servants and female servants , and had servants born in my house . I also had great possessions of herds and flocks , above all who were before me in Jerusalem ;
so I was great , and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem . my wisdom also remained with me .
I turned myself to consider wisdom , madness , and Folly : for what can the king 's successor do ? just that which has been done long ago .
the wise man 's eyes are in his head , and the fool walks in darkness--and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all .
so I hated life , because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me ; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind .
I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun , because I must leave it to the man who comes after me .
therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun .
for what has a man of all his labor , and of the striving of his heart , in which he labors under the sun ?
for all his days are sorrows , and his travail is grief ; yes , even in the night his heart takes no rest . this also is vanity .
a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
a time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
a time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ;
a time to seek , and a time to lose ; a time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
a time to tear , and a time to sew ; a time to keep silence , and a time to speak ;
what profit has he who works in that in which he labors ?
I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice , and to do good as long as they live .
also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy good in all his labor , is the gift of God .
I know that whatever God does , it shall be forever . nothing can be added to it , nor anything taken from it ; and God has done it , that men should fear before him .
that which is has been long ago , and that which is to be has been long ago : and God seeks again that which is passed away .
moreover I saw under the sun , in the place of justice , that wickedness was there ; and in the place of righteousness , that wickedness was there .
I said in my heart , " As for the sons of men , God tests them , so that they may see that they themselves are like animals .
all go to one place . all are from the dust , and all turn to dust again .
who knows the spirit of man , whether it goes upward , and the spirit of the animal , whether it goes downward to the earth ? "
therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive .
yes , better than them both is him who has not yet been , who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man 's neighbor . this also is vanity and a striving after wind .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but woe to him who is alone when he falls , and doesn 't have another to lift him up .
if a man prevails against one who is alone , two shall withstand him ; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken .
better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn 't know how to receive admonition any more .
for out of prison he came forth to be king ; yes , even in his kingdom he was born poor .
I saw all the living who walk under the sun , that they were with the youth , the other , who succeeded him .
guard your steps when you go to God 's house ; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools , for they don 't know that they do evil .
Don 't be rash with your mouth , and don 't let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God ; for God is in heaven , and you on earth . therefore let your words be few .
for as a dream comes with a multitude of cares , so a fool 's speech with a multitude of words .
when you vow a vow to God , don 't defer to pay it ; for he has no pleasure in fools . pay that which you vow .
it is better that you should not vow , than that you should vow and not pay .
Don 't allow your mouth to lead you into sin . Don 't protest before the messenger that this was a mistake . why should God be angry at your voice , and destroy the work of your hands ?
for in the multitude of dreams there are vanities , as well as in many words : but you must fear God .
moreover the profit of the earth is for all . the king profits from the field .
he who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he who loves abundance , with increase : this also is vanity .
when goods increase , those who eat them are increased ; and what advantage is there to its owner , except to feast on them with his eyes ?
the sleep of a laboring man is sweet , whether he eats little or much ; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep .
this also is a grievous evil , that in all points as he came , so shall he go . and what profit does he have who labors for the wind ?
all his days he also eats in darkness , he is frustrated , and has sickness and wrath .
for he shall not often reflect on the days of his life ; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart .
there is an evil which I have seen under the sun , and it is heavy on men :
all the labor of man is for his mouth , and yet the appetite is not filled .
for what advantage has the wise more than the fool ? what has the poor man , that knows how to walk before the living ?
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire . this also is vanity and a chasing after wind .
whatever has been , its name was given long ago ; and it is known what man is ; neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he .
a good name is better than fine perfume ; and the day of death better than the day of one 's birth .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
sorrow is better than laughter ; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
for as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool . this also is vanity .
surely extortion makes the wise man foolish ; and a bribe destroys the understanding .
better is the end of a thing than its beginning . the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
Don 't be hasty in your spirit to be angry , for anger rests in the bosom of fools .
wisdom is as good as an inheritance . yes , it is more excellent for those who see the sun .
for wisdom is a defense , even as money is a defense ; but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it .
consider the work of God , for who can make that straight , which he has made crooked ?
in the day of prosperity be joyful , and in the day of adversity consider ; yes , God has made the one side by side with the other , to the end that man should not find out anything after him .
all this have I seen in my days of vanity : there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing .
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don 't withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city .
also don 't take heed to all words that are spoken , lest you hear your servant curse you ;
all this have I proved in wisdom . I said , " I will be wise " ; but it was far from me .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things , and to know that wickedness is stupidity , and that foolishness is madness .
" behold , I have found this , " says the preacher , " one to another , to find out the scheme ;
which my soul still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom makes his face shine , and the hardness of his face is changed .
I say , " keep the king 's command ! " because of the oath to God .
Don 't be hasty to go out of his presence . Don 't persist in an evil thing , for he does whatever pleases him ,
whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm , and his wise heart will know the time and procedure .
for there is a time and procedure for every purpose , although the misery of man is heavy on him .
for he doesn 't know that which will be ; for who can tell him how it will be ?
all this have I seen , and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun . there is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt .
so I saw the wicked buried . indeed they came also from holiness . they went and were forgotten in the city where they did this . this also is vanity .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times , and lives long , yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God , who are reverent before him .
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow ; because he doesn 't fear God .
when I applied my heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done on the earth ( for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes ) ,
for to him who is joined with all the living there is hope ; for a living dog is better than a dead lion .
for the living know that they will die , but the dead don 't know anything , neither do they have any more a reward ; for their memory is forgotten .
also their love , their hatred , and their envy has perished long ago ; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun .
go your way--eat your bread with joy , and drink your wine with a merry heart ; for God has already accepted your works .
let your garments be always white , and don 't let your head lack oil .
whatever your hand finds to do , do it with your might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in Sheol , where you are going .
I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way , and it seemed great to me .
there was a little city , and few men within it ; and a great king came against it , besieged it , and built great bulwarks against it .
now a poor wise man was found in it , and he by his wisdom delivered the city ; yet no man remembered that same poor man .
the words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him who rules among fools .
dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor ; so does a little Folly outweigh wisdom and honor .
a wise man 's heart is at his right hand , but a fool 's heart at his left .
yes also , when the fool walks by the way , his understanding fails him , and he says to everyone that he is a fool .
if the spirit of the ruler rises up against you , don 't leave your place ; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest .
there is an evil which I have seen under the sun , the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler .
he who digs a pit may fall into it ; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake .
whoever carves out stones may be injured by them . whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby .
if the axe is blunt , and one doesn 't sharpen the edge , then he must use more strength ; but skill brings success .
if the snake Bites before it is charmed , then is there no profit for the charmer 's tongue .
the words of a wise man 's mouth are gracious ; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips .
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness ; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
a fool also multiplies words . man doesn 't know what will be ; and that which will be after him , who can tell him ?
the labor of fools wearies every one of them ; for he doesn 't know how to go to the city .
Woe to you , land , when your king is a child , and your princes eat in the morning !
happy are you , land , when your king is the son of nobles , and your princes eat in due season , for strength , and not for drunkenness !
by slothfulness the roof sinks in ; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks .
a feast is made for laughter , and wine makes the life glad ; and money is the answer for all things .
Don 't curse the king , no , not in your thoughts ; and don 't curse the rich in your bedroom : for a bird of the sky may carry your voice , and that which has wings may tell the matter .
give a portion to seven , yes , even to eight ; for you don 't know what evil will be on the earth .
if the clouds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the earth ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
he who observes the wind won 't sow ; and he who regards the clouds won 't reap .
in the morning sow your seed , and in the evening don 't withhold your hand ; for you don 't know which will prosper , whether this or that , or whether they both will be equally good .
truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun .
yes , if a man lives many years , let him rejoice in them all ; but let him remember the days of darkness , for they shall be many . all that comes is vanity .
therefore remove sorrow from your heart , and put away evil from your flesh ; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are darkened ,
before the silver cord is severed , or the golden bowl is broken , or the pitcher is broken at the spring , or the wheel broken at the cistern ,
and the dust returns to the earth as it was , and the spirit returns to God who gave it .
further , because the preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge . yes , he pondered , sought out , and set in order many Proverbs .
the preacher sought to find out acceptable words , and that which was written blamelessly , words of truth .
the words of the wise are like goads ; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies , which are given from one shepherd .
furthermore , my son , be admonished : of making many books there is no end ; and much study is a weariness of the flesh .
this is the end of the matter . all has been heard . fear God , and keep his commandments ; for this is the whole duty of man .
for God will bring every work into judgment , with every hidden thing , whether it is good , or whether it is evil .
the Song of songs , which is Solomon 's . beloved
let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth ; for your love is better than wine .
Don 't stare at me because I am dark , because the sun has scorched me . my mother 's sons were angry with me . they made me keeper of the vineyards . I haven 't kept my own vineyard .
if you don 't know , most beautiful among women , follow the tracks of the sheep . Graze your young goats beside the shepherds ' tents .
your cheeks are beautiful with earrings , your neck with strings of jewels .
we will make you earrings of gold , with studs of silver . beloved
while the king sat at his table , my perfume spread its fragrance .
my beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi . Lover
behold , you are beautiful , my beloved , yes , pleasant ; and our couch is verdant . Lover
I am a rose of Sharon , a Lily of the valleys . Lover
as a Lily among thorns , so is my love among the daughters . beloved
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , his fruit was sweet to my taste .
I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , or by the hinds of the field , that you not stir up , nor awaken love , until it so desires .
the voice of my beloved ! behold , he comes , leaping on the mountains , skipping on the hills .
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart . behold , he stands behind our wall ! he looks in at the windows . he glances through the lattice .
my beloved spoke , and said to me , " Rise up , my love , my beautiful one , and come away .
for , behold , the winter is past . the rain is over and gone .
the flowers appear on the earth . the time of the singing has come , and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land .
the fig tree ripens her green figs . the vines are in blossom . they give forth their fragrance . arise , my love , my beautiful one , and come away . " Lover
my dove in the clefts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountainside , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is sweet , and your face is lovely .
catch for us the foxes , the little foxes that spoil the vineyards ; for our vineyards are in blossom . beloved
until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , turn , my beloved , and be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether .
by night on my bed , I sought him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn 't find him .
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn 't find him .
I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , or by the hinds of the field , that you not stir up , nor awaken love , until it so desires .
who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all spices of the merchant ?
behold , it is Solomon 's carriage ! sixty mighty men are around it , of the mighty men of Israel .
they all handle the sword , and are expert in war . every man has his sword on his thigh , because of fear in the night .
he made its pillars of silver , its bottom of gold , its seat of purple , its midst being paved with love , from the daughters of Jerusalem .
go forth , you daughters of Zion , and see king Solomon , with the crown with which his mother has crowned him , in the day of his weddings , in the day of the gladness of his heart . Lover
your teeth are like a newly shorn flock , which have come up from the washing , where every one of them has twins . none is bereaved among them .
your lips are like scarlet thread . your mouth is lovely . your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil .
your two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe , which feed among the lilies .
until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , I will go to the mountain of myrrh , to the hill of frankincense .
you have ravished my heart , my sister , my bride . you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes , with one chain of your neck .
how beautiful is your love , my sister , my bride ! how much better is your love than wine ! the fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices !
your lips , my bride , drip like the honeycomb . honey and milk are under your tongue . the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates , with precious fruits : henna with spikenard plants ,
awake , north wind ; and come , you south ! blow on my garden , that its spices may flow out . let my beloved come into his garden , and taste his precious fruits . Lover
I have taken off my robe . indeed , must I put it on ? I have washed my feet . indeed , must I soil them ?
I rose up to open for my beloved . my hands dripped with myrrh , my fingers with liquid myrrh , on the handles of the lock .
the watchmen who go about the city found me . they beat me . they bruised me . the keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me .
I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , If you find my beloved , that you tell him that I am faint with love . friends
how is your beloved better than another beloved , you fairest among women ? how is your beloved better than another beloved , that you do so adjure us ? beloved
his head is like the purest gold . his hair is bushy , black as a raven .
his hands are like rings of gold set with beryl . his body is like Ivory work overlaid with sapphires .
his mouth is sweetness ; yes , he is altogether lovely . this is my beloved , and this is my friend , daughters of Jerusalem . friends
where has your beloved gone , you fairest among women ? where has your beloved turned , that we may seek him with you ? beloved
my beloved has gone down to his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
you are beautiful , my love , as Tirzah , lovely as Jerusalem , awesome as an army with banners .
turn away your eyes from me , for they have overcome me . your hair is like a flock of goats , that lie along the side of Gilead .
your teeth are like a flock of ewes , which have come up from the washing ; of which every one has twins ; none is bereaved among them .
I went down into the nut tree grove , to see the green plants of the valley , to see whether the vine budded , and the pomegranates were in flower .
how beautiful are your feet in sandals , prince 's daughter ! your rounded thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a skillful workman .
your body is like a round goblet , no mixed wine is wanting . your waist is like a heap of wheat , set about with lilies .
your head on you is like Carmel . the hair of your head like purple . the king is held captive in its tresses .
this , your stature , is like a palm tree , your breasts like its fruit .
come , my beloved , let us go forth into the field . let us lodge in the villages .
the mandrakes give forth fragrance . at our doors are all kinds of precious fruits , new and old , which I have stored up for you , my beloved .
Oh that you were like my brother , who nursed from the breasts of my mother ! if I found you outside , I would kiss you ; yes , and no one would despise me .
I would lead you , bringing you into my mother 's house , who would instruct me . I would have you drink spiced wine , of the juice of my pomegranate .
his left hand would be under my head . his right hand would embrace me .
who is this who comes up from the wilderness , leaning on her beloved ? under the apple tree I aroused you . there your mother conceived you . there she was in labor and bore you .
many waters can 't quench love , neither can floods drown it . if a man would give all the wealth of his house for love , he would be utterly scorned . friends
we have a little sister . she has no breasts . what shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for ?
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon . he leased out the vineyard to keepers . each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit .
the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
the ox knows his owner , and the donkey his master 's crib ; but Israel doesn 't know , my people don 't consider . "
why should you be beaten more , that you revolt more and more ? the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
from the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it : wounds , welts , and open sores . they haven 't been closed , neither bandaged , neither soothed with oil .
your country is desolate . your cities are burned with fire . Strangers devour your land in your presence , and it is desolate , as overthrown by strangers .
the daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard , like a hut in a field of melons , like a besieged city .
unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant , we would have been as Sodom ; we would have been like Gomorrah .
hear the word of Yahweh , you rulers of Sodom ! listen to the law of our God , you people of Gomorrah !
when you come to appear before me , who has required this at your hand , to trample my courts ?
bring no more vain offerings . Incense is an abomination to me ; new moons , Sabbaths , and convocations : I can 't bear with evil assemblies .
my soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts . they are a burden to me . I am weary of bearing them .
wash yourselves , make yourself clean . put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes . cease to do evil .
but if you refuse and rebel , you shall be devoured with the sword ; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it . "
how the faithful city has become a prostitute ! she was full of justice ; righteousness lodged in her , but now murderers .
your princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves . everyone loves bribes , and follows after rewards . they don 't judge the fatherless , neither does the cause of the widow come to them .
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , the mighty One of Israel , says : " Ah , I will get relief from my adversaries , and avenge myself of my enemies ;
and I will turn my hand on you , thoroughly purge away your dross , and will take away all your tin .
I will restore your judges as at the first , and your counselors as at the beginning . afterward you shall be called ' The city of righteousness , a faithful town . '
but the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together , and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed .
for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired , and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen .
for you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades , and as a garden that has no water .
the strong will be like tinder , and his work like a spark . they will both burn together , and no one will quench them . "
it shall happen in the latter days , that the mountain of Yahweh 's house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be raised above the hills ; and all nations shall flow to it .
house of Jacob , come , and let us walk in the light of Yahweh .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots .
their land also is full of idols . they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
enter into the rock , and hide in the dust , from before the terror of Yahweh , and from the glory of his majesty .
the lofty looks of man will be brought low , the haughtiness of men will be bowed down , and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day .
for there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and haughty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
for all the cedars of Lebanon , that are high and lifted up , for all the oaks of Bashan ,
for all the high mountains , for all the hills that are lifted up ,
the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low ; and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day .
stop trusting in man , whose breath is in his nostrils ; for of what account is he ?
the people will be oppressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neighbor . the child will behave himself proudly against the old man , and the base against the honorable .
indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father , saying , " You have clothing , you be our ruler , and let this ruin be under your hand . "
for Jerusalem is ruined , and Judah is fallen ; because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh , to provoke the eyes of his glory .
the look of their faces testify against them . they parade their sin like Sodom . they don 't hide it . Woe to their soul ! for they have brought disaster upon themselves .
tell the righteous " Good ! " for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds .
Woe to the wicked ! disaster is upon them ; for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him .
moreover Yahweh said , " Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes , walking to trip as they go , jingling ornaments on their feet ;
therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion , and Yahweh will make their scalps bald . "
in that day , Yahweh 's branch will be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel .
it will happen , that he who is left in Zion , and he who remains in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem ;
when the Lord shall have washed away the Filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst , by the spirit of justice , and by the spirit of burning .
there will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat , and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain .
let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard . my beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill .
what could have been done more to my vineyard , that I have not done in it ? why , when I looked for it to yield grapes , did it yield wild grapes ?
now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard . I will take away its hedge , and it will be eaten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be trampled down .
Woe to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land !
for ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath , and a Homer of seed shall yield an ephah . "
Woe to those who rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; who stay late into the night , until wine inflames them !
the harp , Lyre , tambourine , and flute , with wine , are at their feasts ; but they don 't respect the work of Yahweh , neither have they considered the operation of his hands .
therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge . their honorable men are famished , and their multitudes are parched with thirst .
therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire , and opened its mouth without measure ; and their glory , their multitude , their pomp , and he who rejoices among them , descend into it .
so man is brought low , mankind is humbled , and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled ;
then the lambs will graze as in their pasture , and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich .
Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood , and wickedness as with cart rope ;
who say , " Let him make speed , let him hasten his work , that we may see it ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
Woe to those who call evil good , and good evil ; who put darkness for light , and light for darkness ; who put bitter for sweet , and sweet for bitter !
Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes , and prudent in their own sight !
Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine , and champions at mixing strong drink ;
he will lift up a banner to the nations from far , and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth . behold , they will come speedily and swiftly .
none shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the belt of their waist be untied , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken :
whose arrows are sharp , and all their bows bent . their horses ' hoofs will be like Flint , and their wheels like a whirlwind .
they will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea . if one looks to the land behold , darkness and distress . the light is darkened in its clouds .
in the year that king Uzziah died , I saw the Lord sitting on a throne , high and lifted up ; and his train filled the temple .
above him stood the seraphim . each one had six wings . with two he covered his face . with two he covered his feet . with two he flew .
one called to another , and said , " Holy , holy , holy , is Yahweh of Armies ! the whole earth is full of his glory ! "
the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called , and the house was filled with smoke .
then one of the seraphim flew to me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar .
he touched my mouth with it , and said , " behold , this has touched your lips ; and your iniquity is taken away , and your sin forgiven . "
and Yahweh has removed men far away , and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land .
" let 's go up against Judah , and tear it apart , and let 's divide it among ourselves , and set up a king in its midst , even the son of Tabeel . "
and the head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is Remaliah 's son . if you will not believe , surely you shall not be established . ' "
therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign . behold , the virgin will conceive , and bear a son , and shall call his name Immanuel .
he shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil , and choose the good .
for before the child knows to refuse the evil , and choose the good , the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken .
Yahweh will bring on you , on your people , and on your father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria .
it will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
they shall come , and shall all rest in the desolate valleys , in the clefts of the rocks , on all Thorn hedges , and on all pastures .
in that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River , even with the king of Assyria , the head and the hair of the feet ; and it shall also consume the beard .
it shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two sheep ;
it will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels , shall be for briers and thorns .
all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe , you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of sheep . "
and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify : Uriah the priest , and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah . "
now therefore , behold , the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River : the king of Assyria and all his glory . it will come up over all its channels , and go over all its banks .
make an uproar , you peoples , and be broken in pieces ! listen , all you from far countries : dress for battle , and be shattered ! dress for battle , and be shattered !
take counsel together , and it will be brought to nothing ; speak the word , and it will not stand : for God is with us . "
for Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people , saying ,
" Don 't say , ' A conspiracy ! ' concerning all about which this people say , ' A conspiracy ! ' neither fear their threats , nor be terrorized .
Yahweh of Armies is who you must respect as holy . he is the one you must fear . he is the one you must dread .
many will stumble over it , fall , be broken , be snared , and be captured . "
I will wait for Yahweh , who hides his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
behold , I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies , who dwells in Mount Zion .
turn to the law and to the testimony ! if they don 't speak according to this word , surely there is no morning for them .
they will pass through it , very distressed and hungry ; and it will happen that when they are hungry , they will worry , and curse by their king and by their God . they will turn their faces upward ,
and look to the earth , and see distress , darkness , and the gloom of anguish . they will be driven into thick darkness .
the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light . those who lived in the land of the shadow of death , on them the light has shined .
you have multiplied the nation . you have increased their joy . they rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest , as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
for the yoke of his burden , and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , you have broken as in the day of Midian .
for all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle , and the garments rolled in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
" the bricks have fallen , but we will build with cut stone . the sycamore fig trees have been cut down , but we will put cedars in their place . "
yet the people have not turned to him who struck them , neither have they sought Yahweh of Armies .
the elder and the honorable man is the head , and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail .
for those who lead this people lead them astray ; and those who are led by them are destroyed .
through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies , the land is burnt up ; and the people are the fuel for the fire . no one spares his brother .
Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees , and to the writers who write oppressive decrees ;
what will you do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which will come from afar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
they will only bow down under the prisoners , and will fall under the slain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
as my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols , whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria ;
shall I not , as I have done to Samaria and her idols , so do to Jerusalem and her idols ?
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , will send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire .
the light of Israel will be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame ; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day .
he will consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body . it will be as when a standard bearer faints .
the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few , so that a child could write their number .
for though your people , Israel , are like the sand of the sea , only a remnant of them will return . a destruction is determined , overflowing with righteousness .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation against you will be accomplished , and my anger will be directed to his destruction . "
it will happen in that day , that his burden will depart from off your shoulder , and his yoke from off your neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil .
he has come to Aiath . he has passed through Migron . at Michmash he stores his baggage .
they have gone over the pass . they have taken up their lodging at Geba . Ramah trembles . Gibeah of Saul has fled .
this very day he will halt at Nob . he shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion , the hill of Jerusalem .
behold , the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , will lop the boughs with terror . the tall will be cut down , and the lofty will be brought low .
a shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse , and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit .
the Spirit of Yahweh will rest on him : the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh .
his delight will be in the fear of Yahweh . he will not judge by the sight of his eyes , neither decide by the hearing of his ears ;
the wolf will live with the lamb , and the Leopard will lie down with the young goat ; The calf , the young lion , and the fattened calf together ; and a little child will lead them .
the cow and the bear will graze . their young ones will lie down together . the lion will eat straw like the ox .
the nursing child will play near a Cobra 's hole , and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper 's den .
they will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain ; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh , as the waters cover the sea .
it will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse , who stands as a banner of the peoples ; and his resting place will be glorious .
he will set up a banner for the nations , and will assemble the outcasts of Israel , and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth .
the envy also of Ephraim will depart , and those who persecute Judah will be cut off . Ephraim won 't envy Judah , and Judah won 't persecute Ephraim .
in that day you will say , " I will give thanks to you , Yahweh ; for though you were angry with me , your anger has turned away and you comfort me .
behold , God is my salvation . I will trust , and will not be afraid ; for Yah , Yahweh , is my strength and song ; and he has become my salvation . "
therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation .
in that day you will say , " Give thanks to Yahweh ! call on his name . declare his doings among the peoples . proclaim that his name is exalted !
sing to Yahweh , for he has done excellent things ! let this be known in all the earth !
set up a banner on the bare mountain ! lift up your voice to them ! wave your hand , that they may go into the gates of the nobles .
I have commanded my consecrated ones ; yes , I have called my mighty men for my anger , even my proudly exulting ones .
the noise of a multitude is in the mountains , as of a great people ; the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together ! Yahweh of Armies is mustering the army for the battle .
they come from a far country , from the uttermost part of heaven , even Yahweh , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
behold , the day of Yahweh comes , cruel , with wrath and fierce anger ; to make the land a desolation , and to destroy its sinners out of it .
for the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light . the sun will be darkened in its going forth , and the moon will not cause its light to shine .
I will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their iniquity . I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease , and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible .
I will make people more rare than fine gold , even a person than the pure gold of Ophir .
therefore I will make the heavens tremble , and the earth will be shaken out of its place in the wrath of Yahweh of Armies , and in the day of his fierce anger .
it will happen that like a hunted gazelle , and like sheep that no one gathers , they will each turn to their own people , and will each flee to their own land .
everyone who is found will be thrust through . everyone who is captured will fall by the sword .
their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes . their houses will be ransacked , and their wives raped .
behold , I will stir up the Medes against them , who will not value silver , and as for gold , they will not delight in it .
their bows will dash the young men in pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb . their eyes will not spare children .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Arabian will not pitch a tent there , neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there .
Wolves will cry in their castles , and jackals in the pleasant palaces . her time is near to come , and her days will not be prolonged .
for Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land . the foreigner will join himself with them , and they will unite with the house of Jacob .
it will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked , the scepter of the rulers ,
who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke , who ruled the nations in anger , with a persecution that none restrained .
the whole earth is at rest , and is quiet . they break out song .
yes , the fir trees rejoice with you , with the cedars of Lebanon , saying , " Since you are humbled , no lumberjack has come up against us . "
your pomp is brought down to Sheol , with the sound of your stringed instruments . Maggots are spread out under you , and worms cover you .
how you have fallen from heaven , morning star , son of the dawn ! how you are cut down to the ground , who laid the nations low !
you said in your heart , " I will ascend into heaven ! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God ! I will sit on the mountain of assembly , in the far north !
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds ! I will make myself like the Most High ! "
yet you shall be brought down to Sheol , to the depths of the pit .
all the kings of the nations , sleep in glory , everyone in his own house .
you will not join them in burial , because you have destroyed your land . you have killed your people . the seed of evildoers will not be named forever .
prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their fathers , that they not rise up and possess the earth , and fill the surface of the world with cities .
" I will also make it a possession for the porcupine , and pools of water . I will sweep it with the Broom of destruction , " says Yahweh of Armies .
Yahweh of Armies has sworn , saying , " surely , as I have thought , so shall it happen ; and as I have purposed , so shall it stand :
that I will break the Assyrian in my land , and tread him under foot on my mountains . then his yoke will leave them , and his burden leave their shoulders .
this is the plan that is determined for the whole earth . this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations .
for Yahweh of Armies has planned , and who can stop it ? his hand is stretched out , and who can turn it back ? "
the firstborn of the poor will eat , and the needy will lie down in safety ; and I will kill your root with famine , and your remnant will be killed .
they have gone up to Bayith , and to Dibon , to the high places , to weep . Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba . Baldness is on all of their heads . every beard is cut off .
in their streets , they clothe themselves in sackcloth . in their streets and on their housetops , everyone wails , weeping abundantly .
Heshbon cries out with Elealeh . their voice is heard even to Jahaz . therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud . their souls tremble within them .
my heart cries out for Moab ! her nobles flee to Zoar , to Eglath Shelishiyah ; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping ; for in the way of Horonaim , they raise up a cry of destruction .
for the waters of Nimrim will be desolate ; for the grass has withered away , the tender grass fails , there is no green thing .
therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have stored up , over the Brook of the willows .
for the cry has gone around the borders of Moab ; its wailing to Eglaim , and its wailing to Beer Elim .
send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness , to the mountain of the daughter of Zion .
for it will be that as wandering birds , as a scattered nest , so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon .
a throne will be established in loving kindness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , judging , seeking justice , and swift to do righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Moab , that he is very proud ; even of his arrogance , his pride , and his wrath . his boastings are nothing .
therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah . I will water you with my tears , Heshbon , and Elealeh : for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen .
it will happen that when Moab presents himself , when he wearies himself on the high place , and comes to his sanctuary to pray , that he will not prevail .
this is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past .
the burden of Damascus : " behold , Damascus is taken away from being a city , and it will be a ruinous heap .
the cities of Aroer are forsaken . they will be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the fortress shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria . they will be as the glory of the children of Israel , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" it will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh will become lean .
it will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat , and his arm reaps the grain . yes , it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim .
in that day , people will look to their Maker , and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel .
they will not look to the altars , the work of their hands ; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made , either the Asherim , or the incense altars .
in the day of your planting , you hedge it in . in the morning , you make your seed blossom , but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
Ah , the uproar of many peoples , who roar like the roaring of the seas ; and the rushing of nations , that rush like the rushing of mighty waters !
at evening , behold , terror ! before the morning , they are no more . this is the portion of those who plunder us , and the lot of those who rob us .
Ah , the land of the rustling of wings , which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia ;
all you inhabitants of the world , and you dwellers on the earth , when a banner is lifted up on the mountains , look ! when the trumpet is blown , listen !
for before the harvest , when the blossom is over , and the flower becomes a ripening grape , he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks , and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches .
I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians , and they will fight everyone against his brother , and everyone against his neighbor ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
the spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst . I will destroy its counsel . they will seek the idols , the charmers , those who have familiar spirits , and the wizards .
the waters will fail from the sea , and the river will be wasted and become dry .
the rivers will become foul . the streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up . the reeds and flags will wither away .
the fishermen will lament , and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn , and those who spread nets on the waters will languish .
moreover those who work in combed flax , and those who weave white cloth , will be confounded .
the pillars will be broken in pieces . all those who work for hire will be grieved in soul .
the princes of Zoan have become fools . the princes of Memphis are deceived . they have caused Egypt to go astray , who are the cornerstone of her tribes .
Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works , like a drunken man staggers in his vomit .
in that day the Egyptians will be like women . they will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Armies , which he shakes over them .
the land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt . everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid , because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies , which he determines against it .
in that day , there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar to Yahweh at its border .
Yahweh will strike Egypt , striking and healing . they will return to Yahweh , and he will be entreated by them , and will heal them .
in that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria , and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into Assyria ; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians .
because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them , saying , " blessed be Egypt my people , Assyria the work of my hands , and Israel my inheritance . "
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia , young and old , naked and barefoot , and with buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
the burden of the wilderness of the sea . as whirlwinds in the South sweep through , it comes from the wilderness , from an awesome land .
my heart flutters . horror has frightened me . the twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me .
they prepare the table . they set the watch . they eat . they drink . rise up , you princes , oil the shield !
when he sees a troop , horsemen in pairs , a troop of donkeys , a troop of camels , he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness . "
you are my threshing , and the grain of my floor ! " that which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , I have declared to you .
the burden on Arabia . in the forest in Arabia you will lodge , you caravans of Dedanites .
they brought water to him who was thirsty . the inhabitants of the land of TEMA met the fugitives with their bread .
for they fled away from the swords , from the drawn sword , from the bent bow , and from the heat of battle .
for the Lord said to me , " Within a year , as a worker bound by contract would count it , all the glory of Kedar will fail ,
and the residue of the number of the archers , the mighty men of the children of Kedar , will be few ; for Yahweh , the God of Israel , has spoken it . "
all your rulers fled away together . they were bound by the archers . all who were found by you were bound together . they fled far away .
it happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots , and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate .
he took away the covering of Judah ; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest .
you saw the breaches of the city of David , that they were many ; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
you numbered the houses of Jerusalem , and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall .
in that day , the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , called to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to dressing in sackcloth :
thus says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , " Go , get yourself to this treasurer , even to Shebna , who is over the house , and say ,
behold , Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently . yes , he will grasp you firmly .
I will thrust you from your office . you will be pulled down from your station .
it will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah ,
and I will clothe him with your robe , and strengthen him with your belt . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder . he will open , and no one will shut . he will shut , and no one will open .
I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place . he will be for a throne of glory to his father 's house .
they will hang on him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , every small vessel , from the cups even to all the pitchers .
the burden of Tyre . Howl , you ships of Tarshish ! for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in . from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them .
be still , you inhabitants of the coast , you whom the merchants of Sidon , that pass over the sea , have replenished .
on great waters , the seed of the Shihor , the harvest of the Nile , was her revenue . she was the market of nations .
be ashamed , Sidon ; for the sea has spoken , the stronghold of the sea , saying , " I have not travailed , nor brought forth , neither have I nourished young men , nor brought up virgins . "
when the report comes to Egypt , they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre .
is this your joyous city , whose antiquity is of ancient days , whose feet carried her far away to travel ?
Yahweh of Armies has planned it , to stain the pride of all glory , to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth .
he has stretched out his hand over the sea . he has shaken the kingdoms . Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan 's strongholds .
it will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth .
the earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste ; for Yahweh has spoken this word .
the earth mourns and fades away . the world languishes and fades away . the lofty people of the earth languish .
the earth also is polluted under its inhabitants , because they have transgressed the laws , violated the statutes , and broken the everlasting Covenant .
therefore the curse has devoured the earth , and those who dwell therein are found guilty . therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
the mirth of tambourines ceases . the sound of those who rejoice ends . the joy of the harp ceases .
they will not drink wine with a song . strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it .
the confused city is broken down . every house is shut up , that no man may come in .
there is a crying in the streets because of the wine . all joy is darkened . the mirth of the land is gone .
the city is left in desolation , and the gate is struck with destruction .
for it will be so in the midst of the earth among the peoples , as the shaking of an olive tree , as the gleanings when the vintage is done .
these shall lift up their voice . they will shout for the majesty of Yahweh . they cry aloud from the sea .
therefore glorify Yahweh in the east , even the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel , in the islands of the sea !
the earth is utterly broken . the earth is torn apart . the earth is shaken violently .
the earth will stagger like a drunken man , and will sway back and forth like a hammock . its disobedience will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
it shall happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high , and the kings of the earth on the earth .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
Yahweh , you are my God . I will exalt you ! I will praise your name , for you have done wonderful things , things planned long ago , in complete faithfulness and truth .
for you have made a city into a heap , a fortified city into a ruin , a palace of strangers to be no city . it will never be built .
as the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers ; as the heat by the shade of a cloud , the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low .
in this mountain , Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of fat things , a feast of choice wines , of fat things full of marrow , of well refined choice wines .
for in this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest . Moab will be trodden down in his place , even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill .
he will spread out his hands in its midst , like one who swims spreads out hands to swim , but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands .
he has brought the high fortress of your walls down , laid low , and brought to the ground , even to the dust .
in that day , this song will be sung in the land of Judah : " we have a strong city . God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks .
you will keep whoever 's mind is steadfast in perfect peace , because he trusts in you .
for he has brought down those who dwell on high , the lofty city . he lays it low . he lays it low even to the ground . he brings it even to the dust .
the foot shall tread it down ; Even the feet of the poor , and the steps of the needy . "
yes , in the way of your judgments , Yahweh , have we waited for you . your name and your renown are the desire of our soul .
with my soul have I desired you in the night . yes , with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly ; for when your judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness .
let favor be shown to the wicked , yet he will not learn righteousness . in the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully , and will not see Yahweh 's majesty .
Yahweh our God , other lords besides you have had dominion over us , but by you only will we make mention of your name .
the dead shall not live . the deceased shall not rise . therefore have you visited and destroyed them , and caused all memory of them to perish .
you have increased the nation , O Yahweh . you have increased the nation ! you are glorified ! you have enlarged all the borders of the land .
Yahweh , in trouble they have visited you . they poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them .
like as a woman with child , who draws near the time of her delivery , is in pain and cries out in her pangs ; so we have been before you , Yahweh .
come , my people , enter into your rooms , and shut your doors behind you . hide yourself for a little moment , until the indignation is past .
I , Yahweh , am its keeper . I will water it every moment . Lest anyone damage it , I will keep it night and day .
or else let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me . let him make peace with me . "
in days to come , Jacob will take root . Israel will blossom and bud . they will fill the surface of the world with fruit .
in measure , when you send them away , you contend with them . he has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind .
for the fortified city is solitary , a habitation deserted and forsaken , like the wilderness . the calf will feed there , and there he will lie down , and consume its branches .
it will happen in that day , that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the Brook of Egypt ; and you will be gathered one by one , children of Israel .
Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim , and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty , which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine !
the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot .
in that day , Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory , and a diadem of beauty , to the residue of his people ;
and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment , and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate .
to whom he said , " This is the resting place . give rest to weary " ; and " This is the refreshing " ; yet they would not hear .
for the bed is too short to stretch out on , and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in .
does he who plows to sow plow continually ? does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods ?
when he has leveled its surface , doesn 't he plant the dill , and scatter the cumin seed , and put in the wheat in rows , the barley in the appointed place , and the spelt in its place ?
for the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin ; but the dill is beaten out with a stick , and the cumin with a rod .
bread flour must be ground ; so he will not always be threshing it . although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it , his horses don 't grind it .
then I will distress Ariel , and there will be mourning and lamentation . she shall be to me as an altar Hearth .
I will encamp against you all around you , and will lay siege against you with posted troops . I will raise siege works against you .
but the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust , and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away . yes , it will be in an instant , suddenly .
she will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with Thunder , with earthquake , with great noise , with whirlwind and storm , and with the flame of a devouring fire .
pause and wonder ! blind yourselves and be blind ! they are drunken , but not with wine ; they stagger , but not with strong drink .
for Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep , and has closed your eyes , the prophets ; and he has covered your heads , the seers .
Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh , and whose works are in the dark , and who say , " Who sees us ? " and " Who knows us ? "
Isn 't it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest ?
in that day , the deaf will hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness .
the humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh , and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
for the ruthless is brought to nothing , and the scoffer ceases , and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off--
who cause a person to be indicted by a word , and lay a snare for the arbiter in the gate , and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony .
therefore thus says Yahweh , who redeemed Abraham , concerning the house of Jacob : " Jacob shall no longer be ashamed , neither shall his face grow pale .
they also who err in spirit will come to understanding , and those who grumble will receive instruction . "
for their princes are at Zoan , and their ambassadors have come to Hanes .
they shall all be ashamed because of a people that can 't profit them , that are not a help nor profit , but a shame , and also a reproach . "
for Egypt helps in vain , and to no purpose ; therefore have I called her Rahab who sits still .
now go , write it before them on a tablet , and inscribe it in a book , that it may be for the time to come forever and ever .
get out of the way . turn aside from the path . cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us . "
therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel , " Because you despise this word , and trust in oppression and perverseness , and rely on it ;
therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant .
but you said , " No , for we will flee on horses " ; therefore you will flee ; and , " We will ride on the swift " ; therefore those who pursue you will be swift .
one thousand will flee at the threat of one . at the threat of five , you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain , and like a banner on a hill .
for the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem . you will weep no more . he will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry . when he hears you , he will answer you .
and when you turn to the right hand , and when you turn to the left , your ears will hear a voice behind you , saying , " This is the way . walk in it . "
you shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver , and the plating of your molten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an unclean thing . you shall tell it , " Go away ! "
the oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory provender , which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork .
there shall be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
behold , the name of Yahweh comes from far away , burning with his anger , and in thick rising smoke . his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue is as a devouring fire .
his breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction ; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples .
you will have a song , as in the night when a holy feast is kept ; and gladness of heart , as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
for through the voice of Yahweh the Assyrian will be dismayed . he will strike him with his rod .
every stroke of the rod of punishment , which Yahweh will lay on him , will be with the sound of tambourines and harps . he will fight with them in battles , brandishing weapons .
yet he also is wise , and will bring disaster , and will not call back his words , but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of those who work iniquity .
as birds hovering , so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem . he will protect and deliver it . he will pass over and preserve it . "
for in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold--sin which your own hands have made for you .
his rock will pass away by reason of terror , and his princes will be afraid of the banner , " says Yahweh , whose fire is in Zion , and his furnace in Jerusalem .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the storm , as streams of water in a dry place , as the shade of a large rock in a weary land .
the eyes of those who see will not be dim , and the ears of those who hear will listen .
the heart of the rash will understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly .
the fool will no longer be called noble , nor the scoundrel be highly respected .
the ways of the scoundrel are evil . he devises wicked devices to destroy the humble with lying words , even when the needy speaks right .
rise up , you women who are at ease ! hear my voice ! you careless daughters , give ear to my speech !
for days beyond a year you will be troubled , you careless women ; for the vintage shall fail . the harvest won 't come .
Tremble , you women who are at ease ! be troubled , you careless ones ! strip yourselves , make yourselves naked , and put sackcloth on your waist .
beat your breasts for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine .
for the palace will be forsaken . the populous city will be deserted . the hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever , a delight for wild donkeys , a pasture of flocks ;
until the Spirit is poured on us from on high , and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field , and the fruitful field is considered a forest .
the work of righteousness will be peace ; and the effect of righteousness , quietness and confidence forever .
my people will live in a peaceful habitation , in safe dwellings , and in quiet resting places .
blessed are you who sow beside all waters , who send out the feet of the ox and the donkey .
at the noise of the Thunder , the peoples have fled . when you lift yourself up , the nations are scattered .
Yahweh is exalted , for he dwells on high . he has filled Zion with justice and righteousness .
there will be stability in your times , abundance of salvation , wisdom , and knowledge . the fear of Yahweh is your treasure .
the highways are desolate . the traveling man ceases . the Covenant is broken . he has despised the cities . he doesn 't respect man .
you will conceive chaff . you will bring forth stubble . your breath is a fire that will devour you .
the peoples will be like the burning of lime , like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire .
hear , you who are far off , what I have done ; and , you who are near , acknowledge my might . "
he will dwell on high . his place of defense will be the fortress of rocks . his bread will be supplied . his waters will be sure .
your eyes will see the king in his beauty . they will see a distant land .
your heart will meditate on the terror . where is he who counted ? where is he who weighed ? where is he who counted the towers ?
you will no longer see the fierce people , a people of a deep speech that you can 't comprehend , with a strange language that you can 't understand .
but there Yahweh will be with us in majesty , a place of broad rivers and streams , in which no galley with oars will go , neither will any gallant ship pass by there .
for Yahweh is our judge . Yahweh is our lawgiver . Yahweh is our king . he will save us .
come near , you nations , to hear ! listen , you peoples . let the earth and all it contains hear ; the world , and everything that comes from it .
for Yahweh is enraged against all the nations , and angry with all their armies . he has utterly destroyed them . he has given them over for slaughter .
their slain will also be cast out , and the stench of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will melt in their blood .
all of the army of the sky will be dissolved . the sky will be rolled up like a scroll , and all its armies will fade away , as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree .
for my sword has drunk its fill in the sky . behold , it will come down on Edom , and on the people of my curse , for judgment .
the wild oxen will come down with them , and the young bulls with the mighty bulls ; and their land will be drunken with blood , and their dust made greasy with fat .
it won 't be quenched night nor day . its smoke will go up forever . from generation to generation , it will lie waste . no one will pass through it forever and ever .
but the pelican and the porcupine will possess it . the owl and the raven will dwell in it . he will stretch the line of confusion over it , and the Plumb line of emptiness .
they shall call its nobles to the kingdom , but none shall be there ; and all its princes shall be nothing .
thorns will come up in its palaces , nettles and thistles in its fortresses ; and it will be a habitation of jackals , a court for ostriches .
the wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves , and the wild goat will cry to his fellow . yes , the night creature shall settle there , and shall find herself a place of rest .
the arrow snake will make her nest there , and lay , Hatch , and gather under her shade . yes , the kites will be gathered there , every one with her Mate .
search in the book of Yahweh , and read : not one of these will be missing. none will lack her Mate . for my mouth has commanded , and his Spirit has gathered them .
the wilderness and the dry land will be glad . the desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose .
it will blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's glory Lebanon will be given to it , the excellence of Carmel and Sharon . they will see Yahweh 's glory , the excellence of our God .
then the eyes of the blind will be opened , and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped .
then the lame man will leap like a deer , and the tongue of the mute will sing ; for waters will break out in the wilderness , and streams in the desert .
no lion will be there , nor will any ravenous animal go up on it . they will not be found there ; but the redeemed will walk there .
now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah , and captured them .
the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army . he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller 's field highway .
Rabshakeh said to them , " Now tell Hezekiah , ' Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria , " What confidence is this in which you trust ?
I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words . now in whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
now therefore , please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and called out with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
thus says the king , ' Don 't let Hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you .
Don 't let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us . this city won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . " '
beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , " Yahweh will deliver us . " have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? have they delivered Samaria from my hand ?
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , covered himself with sackcloth , and went into Yahweh 's house .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
so Rabshakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah , for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish .
he heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , " He has come out to fight against you . " when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
" thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , ' Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , " Jerusalem won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
behold , you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands , by destroying them utterly . shall you be delivered ?
have the gods of the nations delivered them , which my fathers have destroyed , Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , and the children of Eden who were in Telassar ?
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it . then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh 's house , and spread it before Yahweh .
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , Yahweh our God , save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh , even you only . "
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dug and drunk water , and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt . "
but I know your sitting down , your going out , your coming in , and your raging against me .
for out of Jerusalem a remnant will go forth , and survivors will escape from Mount Zion . the zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this . '
by the way that he came , by the same he shall return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yahweh .
'For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
the angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and eighty @-@ five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh ,
" go , and tell Hezekiah , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of David your father , " I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . behold , I will add fifteen years to your life .
I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria , and I will defend this city .
this shall be the sign to you from Yahweh , that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken .
the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and had recovered of his sickness .
I said , " In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol . I am deprived of the residue of my years . "
I said , " I won 't see Yah , Yah in the land of the living . I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
I waited patiently until morning . he breaks all my bones like a lion . from day even to night you will make an end of me .
what will I say ? he has both spoken to me , and himself has done it . I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul .
Lord , men live by these things ; and my spirit finds life in all of them : you restore me , and cause me to live .
behold , for peace I had great anguish , but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption ; for you have cast all my sins behind your back .
for Sheol can 't praise you . death can 't celebrate you . those who go down into the pit can 't hope for your truth .
the living , the living , he shall praise you , as I do this day . the father shall make known your truth to the children .
Yahweh will save me . therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Yahweh .
now Isaiah had said , " Let them take a cake of figs , and lay it for a poultice on the boil , and he shall recover . "
at that time , Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah ; for he heard that he had been sick , and had recovered .
then he asked , " What have they seen in your house ? " Hezekiah answered , " They have seen all that is in my house . there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them . "
'Behold , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Babylon . nothing will be left , ' says Yahweh .
'They will take away your sons who will issue from you , whom you shall father , and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon 's palace . ' "
" speak comfortably to Jerusalem ; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned , that she has received of Yahweh 's hand double for all her sins . "
every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low . the uneven shall be made level , and the rough places a plain .
the glory of Yahweh shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together ; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it . "
the grass Withers , the flower fades , because Yahweh 's breath blows on it . surely the people are like grass .
behold , the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one , and his arm will rule for him . behold , his reward is with him , and his recompense before him .
he will feed his flock like a shepherd . he will gather the lambs in his arm , and carry them in his bosom . he will gently lead those who have their young .
who did he take counsel with , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of justice , and taught him knowledge , and showed him the way of understanding ?
all the nations are like nothing before him . they are regarded by him as less than nothing , and vanity .
to whom then will you liken God ? or what likeness will you compare to him ?
a workman has cast an image , and the goldsmith overlays it with gold , and casts silver chains for it .
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard , yet ? haven 't you been told from the beginning ? haven 't you understood from the foundations of the earth ?
it is he who sits above the circle of the earth , and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers ; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain , and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in ;
they are planted scarcely . they are sown scarcely . their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground . he merely blows on them , and they wither , and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble .
why do you say , Jacob , and speak , Israel , " My way is hidden from Yahweh , and the justice due me is disregarded by my God ? "
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard ? the everlasting God , Yahweh , The Creator of the ends of the earth , doesn 't faint . he isn 't weary . his understanding is unsearchable .
he gives power to the weak . he increases the strength of him who has no might .
but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength . they will mount up with wings like eagles . they will run , and not be weary . they will walk , and not faint .
" keep silent before me , islands , and let the peoples renew their strength . let them come near , then let them speak . let 's meet together for judgment .
he pursues them , and passes by safely , Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet .
who has worked and done it , calling the generations from the beginning ? I , Yahweh , the first , and with the last , I am he . "
the islands have seen , and fear . the ends of the earth tremble . they approach , and come .
you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth , and called from its corners , and said to you , ' You are my servant , I have chosen you and not cast you away ; '
behold , all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded . those who strive with you will be like nothing , and shall perish .
you will seek them , and won 't find them , even those who contend with you . those who war against you will be as nothing , as a non @-@ existent thing .
for I , Yahweh your God , will hold your right hand , saying to you , ' Don 't be afraid . I will help you . '
behold , I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth . you will thresh the mountains , and beat them small , and will make the hills like chaff .
you will winnow them , and the wind will carry them away , and the whirlwind will scatter them . you will rejoice in Yahweh . you will glory in the Holy One of Israel .
the poor and needy seek water , and there is none . their tongue fails for thirst . I , Yahweh , will answer them . I , the God of Israel , will not forsake them .
I will open rivers on the bare heights , and springs in the midst of the valleys . I will make the wilderness a pool of water , and the dry land springs of water .
I will put cedar , acacia , myrtle , and oil trees in the wilderness . I will set fir trees , pine , and box trees together in the desert ;
that they may see , know , consider , and understand together , that the hand of Yahweh has done this , and the Holy One of Israel has created it .
declare the things that are to come hereafter , that we may know that you are gods . yes , do good , or do evil , that we may be dismayed , and see it together .
behold , you are of nothing , and your work is of nothing . he who chooses you is an abomination .
when I look , there is no man ; even among them there is no counselor who , when I ask of them , can answer a word .
" behold , my servant , whom I uphold ; my chosen , in whom my soul delights-- I have put my Spirit on him . he will bring justice to the nations .
he will not shout , nor raise his voice , nor cause it to be heard in the street .
he won 't break a bruised Reed . he won 't quench a dimly burning wick . he will faithfully bring justice .
he will not fail nor be discouraged , until he has set justice in the earth , and the islands will wait for his law . "
" I , Yahweh , have called you in righteousness , and will hold your hand , and will keep you , and make you a Covenant for the people , as a light for the nations ;
to open the blind eyes , to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon , and those who sit in darkness out of the prison .
" I am Yahweh . that is my name . I will not give my glory to another , nor my praise to engraved images .
let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices , with the villages that Kedar inhabits . let the inhabitants of Sela sing . let them shout from the top of the mountains !
Yahweh will go out like a mighty man . he will stir up zeal like a man of war . he will raise a war cry . yes , he will shout aloud . he will triumph over his enemies .
" I have been silent a long time . I have been quiet and restrained myself . now I will cry out like a travailing woman . I will both gasp and pant .
I will destroy mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs . I will make the rivers islands , and will dry up the pools .
" those who trust in engraved images , who tell molten images , ' You are our gods ' will be turned back . they will be utterly disappointed .
it pleased Yahweh , for his righteousness ' sake , to magnify the law , and make it honorable .
who is there among you who will give ear to this ? who will listen and hear for the time to come ?
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not overflow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and flame will not scorch you .
for I am Yahweh your God , the Holy One of Israel , your Savior . I have given Egypt as your ransom , Ethiopia and Seba in your place .
since you have been precious and honored in my sight , and I have loved you ; therefore I will give people in your place , and nations instead of your life .
Don 't be afraid ; for I am with you . I will bring your seed from the east , and gather you from the west .
everyone who is called by my name , and whom I have created for my glory , whom I have formed , yes , whom I have made . ' "
I have declared , I have saved , and I have shown ; and there was no strange god among you . therefore you are my witnesses , " says Yahweh , " and I am God .
I am Yahweh , your Holy One , the Creator of Israel , your King . "
" Don 't remember the former things , and don 't consider the things of old .
behold , I will do a new thing . it springs forth now . Don 't you know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
the animals of the field shall honor me , the jackals and the ostriches ; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen ,
you have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings ; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices . I have not burdened you with offerings , nor wearied you with frankincense .
you have bought me no sweet cane with money , nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices ; but you have burdened me with your sins . you have wearied me with your iniquities .
I , even I , am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake ; and I will not remember your sins .
put me in remembrance . let us plead together . set forth your case , that you may be justified .
this is what Yahweh who made you , and formed you from the womb , who will help you says : " Don 't be afraid , Jacob my servant ; and you , Jeshurun , whom I have chosen .
for I will pour water on him who is thirsty , and streams on the dry ground . I will pour my Spirit on your seed , and my blessing on your offspring :
this is what Yahweh , the King of Israel , and his Redeemer , Yahweh of Armies , says : " I am the first , and I am the last ; and besides me there is no God .
behold , all his fellows will be disappointed ; and the workmen are mere men . let them all be gathered together . let them stand up . they will fear . they will be put to shame together .
the blacksmith takes an axe , works in the coals , fashions it with hammers , and works it with his strong arm . he is hungry , and his strength fails ; he drinks no water , and is faint .
he cuts down cedars for himself , and takes the Cypress and the oak , and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest . he plants a fir tree , and the rain nourishes it .
they don 't know , neither do they consider : for he has shut their eyes , that they can 't see ; and their hearts , that they can 't understand .
he feeds on ashes . a deceived heart has turned him aside ; and he can 't deliver his soul , nor say , " Isn 't there a lie in my right hand ? "
remember these things , Jacob and Israel ; for you are my servant . I have formed you . you are my servant . Israel , you will not be forgotten by me .
I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , your transgressions , and , as a cloud , your sins . return to me , for I have redeemed you .
" I will go before you , and make the rough places smooth . I will break the doors of brass in pieces , and cut apart the bars of iron .
I will give you the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Yahweh , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
for Jacob my servant 's sake , and Israel my chosen , I have called you by your name . I have surnamed you , though you have not known me .
I am Yahweh , and there is none else . besides me , there is no God . I will strengthen you , though you have not known me ;
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none besides me . I am Yahweh , and there is no one else .
I form the light , and create darkness . I make peace , and create calamity . I am Yahweh , who does all these things .
Woe to him who says to a father , ' What have you become the father of ? ' or to a mother , ' To what have you given birth ? ' "
thus says Yahweh , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker : " you ask me about the things that are to come , concerning my sons , and you command me concerning the work of my hands !
I have made the earth , and created man on it . I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens ; and I have commanded all their army .
they will be disappointed , yes , confounded , all of them . those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together .
" assemble yourselves and come . draw near together , you who have escaped from the nations . those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved image , and pray to a god that can 't save .
" look to me , and be saved , all the ends of the earth ; for I am God , and there is no other .
I have sworn by myself , the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and will not return , that to me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall take an oath .
they will say of me , ' There is righteousness and strength only in Yahweh . ' " even to him shall men come ; and all those who were incensed against him shall be disappointed .
they stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves have gone into captivity .
" listen to me , house of Jacob , and all the remnant of the house of Israel , that have been borne from their birth , that have been carried from the womb ;
and even to old age I am he , and even to gray hairs will I carry you . I have made , and I will bear ; yes , I will carry , and will deliver .
" to whom will you liken me , and make me equal , and compare me , that we may be like ?
remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me ;
declaring the end from the beginning , and from ancient times things that are not yet done ; saying , My counsel shall stand , and I will do all my pleasure ;
calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man of my counsel from a far country ; yes , I have spoken , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed , I will also do it .
your nakedness shall be uncovered , yes , your shame shall be seen : I will take vengeance , and will spare no man . "
I was angry with my people , I profaned my inheritance , and gave them into your hand : you showed them no mercy ; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke .
you said , ' I shall be a mistress forever ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored : those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter ; there shall be none to save you .
( for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves on the God of Israel ; Yahweh of Armies is his name ) :
I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my mouth , and I showed them : suddenly I did them , and they happened .
because I knew that you are obstinate , and your neck is an iron sinew , and your brow brass ;
they are created now , and not from of old ; and before this day you didn 't hear them ; lest you should say , ' behold , I knew them . '
for my name 's sake will I defer my anger , and for my praise will I refrain for you , that I not cut you off .
behold , I have refined you , but not as silver ; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction .
for my own sake , for my own sake , will I do it ; for how should my name be profaned ? I will not give my glory to another .
" listen to me , O Jacob , and Israel my called : I am he ; I am the first , I also am the last .
yes , my hand has laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand has spread out the heavens : when I call to them , they stand up together .
" assemble yourselves , all you , and hear ; who among them has declared these things ? he whom Yahweh loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans .
I , even I , have spoken ; yes , I have called him ; I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
" come near to me and hear this : " from the beginning I have not spoken in secret ; from the time that it was , there am I. " Now the Lord Yahweh has sent me , with his Spirit .
thus says Yahweh , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : I am Yahweh your God , who teaches you to profit , who leads you by the way that you should go .
Oh that you had listened to my commandments ! then your peace would have been like a river , and your righteousness like the waves of the sea :
your seed also had been as the sand , and the offspring of your body like its grains : his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me .
they didn 't thirst when he led them through the deserts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them : for he who has mercy on them will lead them , even by springs of water he will guide them .
behold , these shall come from far ; and behold , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sinim . "
behold , I have engraved you on the palms of my hands ; your walls are continually before me .
your children make haste ; your destroyers and those who made you waste shall go forth from you .
" for , as for your waste and your desolate places , and your land that has been destroyed , surely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants , and those who swallowed you up shall be far away .
the children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears , The place is too small for me ; give place to me that I may dwell .
shall the prey be taken from the mighty , or the lawful captives be delivered ?
the Lord Yahweh has opened my ear , and I was not rebellious , neither turned away backward .
I gave my back to the strikers , and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair ; I didn 't hide my face from shame and spitting .
he is near who justifies me ; who will bring charges against me ? let us stand up together : who is my adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord Yahweh will help me ; who is he who shall condemn me ? behold , all they shall wax old as a garment , the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you who fears Yahweh , who obeys the voice of his servant ? he who walks in darkness , and has no light , let him trust in the name of Yahweh , and rely on his God .
" listen to me , you who follow after righteousness , you who seek Yahweh : look to the rock you were cut from , and to the hold of the pit you were dug from .
look to Abraham your father , and to Sarah who bore you ; for when he was but one I called him , and I blessed him , and made him many .
" attend to me , my people ; and give ear to me , my nation : for a law shall go forth from me , and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples .
my righteousness is near , my salvation is gone forth , and my arms shall judge the peoples ; the islands shall wait for me , and on my arm shall they trust .
" listen to me , you who know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; don 't fear the reproach of men , neither be dismayed at their insults .
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool ; but my righteousness shall be forever , and my salvation to all generations . "
Isn 't it you who dried up the sea , the waters of the great deep ; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over ?
the captive exile shall speedily be freed ; and he shall not die and go down into the pit , neither shall his bread fail .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
these two things have happened to you . who will bemoan you ? Desolation and destruction , and the famine and the sword ; how shall I comfort you ?
for thus says Yahweh , " You were sold for nothing ; and you shall be redeemed without money . "
for thus says the Lord Yahweh , " My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there : and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause .
therefore my people shall know my name . therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks ; behold , it is I. "
the voice of your watchmen ! they lift up the voice , together do they sing ; for they shall see eye to eye , when Yahweh returns to Zion .
break forth into joy , sing together , you waste places of Jerusalem ; for Yahweh has comforted his people , he has redeemed Jerusalem .
Yahweh has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
for you shall not go out in haste , neither shall you go by flight : for Yahweh will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard .
behold , my servant shall deal wisely , he shall be exalted and lifted up , and shall be very high .
like as many were astonished at you ( his appearance was marred more than any man , and his form more than the sons of men ) ,
so shall he sprinkle many nations ; kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they understand .
who has believed our message ? to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed ?
for he grew up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of dry ground . he has no good looks or majesty . when we see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
surely he has borne our sickness , and carried our suffering ; yet we considered him plagued , struck by God , and afflicted .
all we like sheep have gone astray . everyone has turned to his own way ; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all .
they made his grave with the wicked , and with a rich man in his death ; although he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
after the suffering of his soul , he will see the light and be satisfied . my righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself ; and he will bear their iniquities .
" enlarge the place of your tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations ; don 't spare : lengthen your cords , and strengthen your stakes .
for you shall spread out on the right hand and on the left ; and your seed shall possess the nations , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
for your Maker is your husband ; Yahweh of Armies is his name : and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer ; the God of the whole earth shall he be called .
in overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment ; but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you , " says Yahweh your Redeemer .
for the mountains may depart , and the hills be removed ; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you , neither shall my Covenant of peace be removed , " says Yahweh who has mercy on you .
" you afflicted , tossed with storms , and not comforted , behold , I will set your stones in beautiful colors , and lay your foundations with sapphires .
I will make your pinnacles of rubies , and your gates of Sparkling jewels , and all your walls of precious stones .
all your children shall be taught of Yahweh ; and great shall be the peace of your children .
in righteousness you shall be established : you shall be far from oppression , for you shall not be afraid ; and from terror , for it shall not come near you .
behold , they may gather together , but not by me : whoever shall gather together against you shall fall because of you .
" behold , I have created the Smith who blows the fire of coals , and brings forth a weapon for his work ; and I have created the waster to destroy .
" come , everyone who thirsts , to the waters ! come , he who has no money , buy , and eat ! yes , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
behold , I have given him for a witness to the peoples , a leader and commander to the peoples .
seek Yahweh while he may be found ; call you on him while he is near :
let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts ; and let him return to Yahweh , and he will have mercy on him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
" for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
for as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky , and doesn 't return there , but waters the earth , and makes it bring forth and bud , and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater ;
blessed is the man who does this , and the son of man who holds it fast ; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it , and keeps his hand from doing any evil . "
to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh , to minister to him , and to love the name of Yahweh , to be his servants , everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it , and holds fast my Covenant ;
the Lord Yahweh , who gathers the outcasts of Israel , says , " Yet will I gather others to him , besides his own who are gathered . "
his watchmen are blind , they are all without knowledge ; they are all mute dogs , they can 't bark ; dreaming , lying down , loving to slumber .
yes , the dogs are greedy , they can never have enough ; and these are shepherds who can 't understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
the righteous perishes , and no man lays it to heart ; and merciful men are taken away , none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil .
he enters into peace ; they rest in their beds , each one who walks in his uprightness .
on a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed ; there also you went up to offer sacrifice .
you went to the king with oil , and increased your perfumes , and sent your ambassadors far off , and debased yourself even to Sheol .
you were wearied with the length of your way ; yet you didn 't say , ' It is in vain . ' you found a reviving of your strength ; therefore you weren 't faint .
for I will not contend forever , neither will I be always angry ; for the spirit would faint before me , and the souls who I have made .
for the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry , and struck him ; I hid myself and was angry ; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart .
I create the fruit of the lips : peace , peace , to him who is far off and to him who is near , " says Yahweh ; " and I will heal them . "
" there is no peace , " says my God , " for the wicked . "
" cry aloud , don 't spare , lift up your voice like a trumpet , and declare to my people their disobedience , and to the house of Jacob their sins .
behold , you fast for strife and contention , and to strike with the fist of wickedness : you don 't fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high .
then your light shall break forth as the morning , and your healing shall spring forth speedily ; and your righteousness shall go before you ; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear guard .
and if you draw out your soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul : then your light shall rise in darkness , and your obscurity be as the noonday ;
behold , Yahweh 's hand is not shortened , that it can 't save ; neither his ear heavy , that it can 't hear :
but your iniquities have separated between you and your God , and your sins have hidden his face from you , so that he will not hear .
for your hands are defiled with blood , and your fingers with iniquity ; your lips have spoken lies , your tongue mutters wickedness .
none sues in righteousness , and none pleads in truth : they trust in vanity , and speak lies ; they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity .
they Hatch adders ' eggs , and weave the spider 's web : he who eats of their eggs dies ; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
their feet run to evil , and they make haste to shed innocent blood : their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity ; desolation and destruction are in their paths .
the way of peace they don 't know ; and there is no justice in their goings : they have made them crooked paths ; whoever goes therein does not know peace .
we grope for the wall like the blind ; yes , we grope as those who have no eyes : we stumble at noonday as in the twilight ; among those who are lusty we are as dead men .
we roar all like bears , and moan bitterly like doves : we look for justice , but there is none ; for salvation , but it is far off from us .
for our transgressions are multiplied before you , and our sins testify against us ; for our transgressions are with us , and as for our iniquities , we know them :
transgressing and denying Yahweh , and turning away from following our God , speaking oppression and revolt , conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood .
yes , truth is lacking ; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey . Yahweh saw it , and it displeased him that there was no justice .
he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessor : therefore his own arm brought salvation to him ; and his righteousness , it upheld him .
he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and a helmet of salvation on his head ; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeal as a mantle .
according to their deeds , accordingly he will repay , wrath to his adversaries , recompense to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompense .
" arise , shine ; for your light has come , and the glory of Yahweh is risen on you .
nations shall come to your light , and kings to the brightness of your rising .
then you shall see and be radiant , and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you , the wealth of the nations shall come to you .
the multitude of camels shall cover you , the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah ; all they from Sheba shall come ; they shall bring gold and frankincense , and shall proclaim the praises of Yahweh .
" foreigners shall build up your walls , and their kings shall minister to you : for in my wrath I struck you , but in my favor have I had mercy on you .
" whereas you have been forsaken and hated , so that no man passed through you , I will make you an eternal excellency , a joy of many generations .
you shall also drink the milk of the nations , and shall nurse from royal breasts ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , am your Savior , and your Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
violence shall no more be heard in your land , desolation nor destruction within your borders ; but you shall call your walls salvation , and your gates Praise .
the sun shall be no more your light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you : but Yahweh will be to you an everlasting light , and your God your glory .
your people also shall be all righteous ; they shall inherit the land forever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glorified .
they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks , and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers .
but you shall be named the priests of Yahweh ; men will call you the ministers of our God : you will eat the wealth of the nations , and you will boast in their glory .
instead of your shame you shall have double ; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess double ; everlasting joy shall be to them .
their seed shall be known among the nations , and their offspring among the peoples ; all who see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed . "
for as the earth brings forth its bud , and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth ; so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until her righteousness go forth as brightness , and her salvation as a lamp that burns .
the nations shall see your righteousness , and all kings your glory , and you shall be called by a new name , which the mouth of Yahweh shall name .
you shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh , and a royal diadem in the hand of your God .
behold , Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth , " Say to the daughter of Zion , ' behold , your salvation comes . behold , his reward is with him , and his recompense before him . ' "
they shall call them The holy people , The redeemed of Yahweh : and you shall be called sought out , A city not forsaken .
for the day of vengeance was in my heart , and the year of my redeemed has come .
I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore my own arm brought salvation to me ; and my wrath , it upheld me .
I trod down the peoples in my anger , and made them drunk in my wrath , and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth . "
but they rebelled , and grieved his holy Spirit : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he himself fought against them .
as the livestock that go down into the valley , the Spirit of Yahweh caused them to rest ; so you led your people , to make yourself a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory : where are your zeal and your mighty acts ? the yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me .
for you are our Father , though Abraham doesn 't know us , and Israel does not acknowledge us : you , Yahweh , are our Father ; our Redeemer from everlasting is your name .
O Yahweh , why do you make us to err from your ways , and harden our heart from your fear ? return for your servants ' sake , the tribes of your inheritance .
we have become as they over whom you never bear rule , as those who were not called by your name .
when you did awesome things which we didn 't look for , you came down , the mountains quaked at your presence .
you meet him who rejoices and works righteousness , those who remember you in your ways . behold , you were angry , and we sinned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be saved ?
for we have all become as one who is unclean , and all our righteousness is as a polluted garment : and we all fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , like the wind , take us away .
but now , Yahweh , you are our Father ; we are the clay , and you our Potter ; and we all are the work of your hand .
Don 't be furious , Yahweh , neither remember iniquity forever : see , look , we beg you , we are all your people .
your holy cities are become a wilderness , Zion has become a wilderness , Jerusalem a desolation .
our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised you , is burned with fire ; and all our pleasant places are laid waste .
" I am inquired of by those who didn 't ask ; I am found by those who didn 't seek me : I said , See me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people , who walk in a way that is not good , after their own thoughts ;
who sit among the graves , and lodge in the secret places ; who eat pig 's flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
who say , Stand by yourself , don 't come near to me , for I am holier than you . these are a smoke in my nose , a fire that burns all the day .
I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains ; and my chosen shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in , for my people who have sought me .
behold , my servants shall sing for joy of heart , but you shall cry for sorrow of heart , and shall wail for anguish of spirit .
you shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen ; and the Lord Yahweh will kill you ; and he will call his servants by another name :
" for , behold , I create new heavens and a new earth ; and the former things shall not be remembered , nor come into mind .
but be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create ; for , behold , I create Jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people ; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying .
they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and eat their fruit .
they shall not labor in vain , nor bring forth for calamity ; for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh , and their offspring with them .
it shall happen that , before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
thus says Yahweh , " Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool : what kind of house will you build to me ? and what place shall be my rest ?
a voice of tumult from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of Yahweh that renders recompense to his enemies .
" rejoice with Jerusalem , and be glad for her , all you who love her : rejoice for joy with her , all you who mourn over her ;
that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts ; that you may drink deeply , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory . "
as one whom his mother comforts , so will I comfort you ; and you will be comforted in Jerusalem . "
you will see it , and your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass : and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants ; and he will have indignation against his enemies .
for by fire will Yahweh execute judgment , and by his sword , on all flesh ; and the slain of Yahweh shall be many .
" for I know their works and their thoughts : the time comes , that I will gather all nations and languages ; and they shall come , and shall see my glory .
" for as the new heavens and the new earth , which I will make , shall remain before me , " says Yahweh , " so your seed and your name shall remain .
it shall happen , that from one new moon to another , and from one Sabbath to another , shall all flesh come to worship before me , " says Yahweh .
the words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
then Yahweh put forth his hand , and touched my mouth ; and Yahweh said to me , " behold , I have put my words in your mouth .
behold , I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms , to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow , to build and to plant . "
moreover the word of Yahweh came to me , saying , " Jeremiah , what do you see ? " I said , " I see a branch of an almond tree . "
the word of Yahweh came to me the second time , saying , " What do you see ? " I said , " I see a boiling caldron ; and it is tipping away from the north . "
then Yahweh said to me , " Out of the north evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land .
I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , in that they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , and worshiped the works of their own hands .
" you therefore put your belt on your waist , arise , and speak to them all that I command you . Don 't be dismayed at them , lest I dismay you before them .
they will fight against you ; but they will not prevail against you ; for I am with you , " says Yahweh , " to deliver you . "
Israel was holiness to Yahweh , the first fruits of his increase . all who devour him shall be held guilty . evil shall come on them , " ' says Yahweh . "
hear the word of Yahweh , O house of Jacob , and all the families of the house of Israel !
thus says Yahweh , " What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me , that they have gone far from me , and have walked after vanity , and are become vain ?
I brought you into a plentiful land , to eat its fruit and its Goodness ; but when you entered , you defiled my land , and made my heritage an abomination .
" be astonished , you heavens , at this , and be horribly afraid . be very desolate , " says Yahweh .
" for my people have committed two evils : they have forsaken me , the spring of living waters , and cut them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water .
the children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head .
" haven 't you procured this to yourself , in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God , when he led you by the way ?
yet I had planted you a noble vine , wholly a right seed . how then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me ?
as the thief is ashamed when he is found , so is the house of Israel ashamed ; they , their kings , their princes , and their priests , and their prophets ;
" but where are your gods that you have made for yourselves ? let them arise , if they can save you in the time of your trouble : for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Judah .
" I have struck your children in vain . they received no correction . your own sword has devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
" can a virgin forget her ornaments , or a bride her attire ? yet my people have forgotten me for days without number .
how well you prepare your way to seek love ! therefore you have taught even the wicked women your ways .
also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
" yet you said , ' I am innocent . surely his anger has turned away from me . ' " behold , I will judge you , because you say , ' I have not sinned . '
why do you go about so much to change your way ? you will be ashamed of Egypt also , as you were ashamed of Assyria .
from there also you shall go forth , with your hands on your head ; for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust , and you shall not prosper with them .
therefore the showers have been withheld , and there has been no latter rain ; yet you have a prostitute 's forehead , you refused to be ashamed .
will you not from this time cry to me , ' My Father , you are the guide of my youth ? '
" ' will he retain his anger forever ? will he keep it to the end ? ' behold , you have spoken and have done evil things , and have had your way . "
I said after she had done all these things , ' She will return to me ; ' but she didn 't return ; and her treacherous sister Judah saw it .
it happened through the lightness of her prostitution , that the land was polluted , and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
yet for all this her treacherous sister , Judah , has not returned to me with her whole heart , but only in pretense , " says Yahweh .
only acknowledge your iniquity , that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God , and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree , and you have not obeyed my voice , ' says Yahweh . "
I will give you shepherds according to my heart , who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding .
in those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers .
a voice is heard on the bare heights , the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel ; because they have perverted their way , they have forgotten Yahweh their God .
return , you backsliding children , I will heal your backsliding . " behold , we have come to you ; for you are Yahweh our God .
truly in vain is help from the hills , the tumult on the mountains . truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God .
but the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth , their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
" if you will return , Israel , " says Yahweh , " if you will return to me , and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight ; then you shall not be removed ;
and you shall swear , ' As Yahweh lives , ' in truth , in justice , and in righteousness . the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory . "
for thus says Yahweh to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem , " Break up your fallow ground , and don 't sow among thorns .
declare in Judah , and publish in Jerusalem ; and say , ' blow the trumpet in the land ! ' cry aloud and say , ' assemble yourselves ! let us go into the fortified cities ! '
for this clothe yourself with sackcloth , lament and wail ; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn 't turned back from us .
behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind : his horses are swifter than eagles . Woe to us ! for we are ruined .
Jerusalem , wash your heart from wickedness , that you may be saved . how long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you ?
as keepers of a field , they are against her all around , because she has been rebellious against me , ' " says Yahweh .
destruction on destruction is cried ; for the whole land is laid waste : suddenly are my tents destroyed , and my curtains in a moment .
" for my people are foolish , they don 't know me . they are foolish children , and they have no understanding . they are skillful in doing evil , but to do good they have no knowledge . "
I saw the earth , and , behold , it was waste and void ; and the heavens , and they had no light .
I saw the mountains , and behold , they trembled , and all the hills moved back and forth .
I saw , and behold , there was no man , and all the birds of the sky had fled .
I saw , and behold , the fruitful field was a wilderness , and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh , before his fierce anger .
every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers ; they go into the thickets , and climb up on the rocks : every city is forsaken , and not a man dwells therein .
then I said , " surely these are poor . they are foolish ; for they don 't know the way of Yahweh , nor the law of their God .
Shouldn 't I punish them for these things ? " says Yahweh ; " and shouldn 't my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
" go up on her walls , and destroy ; but don 't make a full end . take away her branches ; for they are not Yahweh 's .
for the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me , " says Yahweh .
the prophets shall become wind , and the word is not in them . thus shall it be done to them . "
" but even in those days , " says Yahweh , " I will not make a full end with you .
" declare this in the house of Jacob , and publish it in Judah , saying ,
'Hear now this , foolish people , and without understanding ; who have eyes , and don 't see ; who have ears , and don 't hear :
" your iniquities have turned away these things , and your sins have withheld good from you .
for among my people are found wicked men . they watch , as fowlers lie in wait . they set a trap . they catch men .
as a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit . therefore they have become great , and grew rich .
" shall I not punish for these things ? " says Yahweh . " shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
the prophets prophesy falsely , and the priests rule by their own authority ; and my people love to have it so . what will you do in the end of it ?
shepherds with their flocks shall come to her ; they shall pitch their tents against her all around ; they shall feed everyone in his place . "
for Yahweh of Armies said , " Cut down trees , and cast up a mound against Jerusalem : this is the city to be visited ; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her .
their houses shall be turned to others , their fields and their wives together ; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land , says Yahweh . "
" for from their least even to their greatest , everyone is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even to the priest , everyone deals falsely .
they have healed also the hurt of my people superficially , saying , ' Peace , peace ! ' when there is no peace .
I set watchmen over you , saying , ' listen to the sound of the trumpet ! ' but they said , ' We will not listen ! '
hear , earth ! behold , I will bring evil on this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not listened to my words ; and as for my law , they have rejected it .
to what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices pleasing to me . "
we have heard its report ; our hands become feeble : anguish has taken hold of us , and pains as of a woman in labor .
Don 't go forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and terror , are on every side .
daughter of my people , clothe yourself with sackcloth , and wallow in ashes ! mourn , as for an only son , most bitter lamentation ; for the destroyer shall suddenly come on us .
" I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among my people ; that you may know and try their way .
the bellows blow fiercely ; the lead is consumed of the fire : in vain do they go on refining ; for the wicked are not plucked away .
for if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings ; if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor ;
then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , from of old even forevermore .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of robbers in your eyes ? behold , I , even I , have seen it , says Yahweh .
but go now to my place which was in Shiloh , where I caused my name to dwell at the first , and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel .
now , because you have done all these works , says Yahweh , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you didn 't hear ; and I called you , but you didn 't answer :
I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your brothers , even the whole seed of Ephraim .
Don 't you see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
do they provoke me to anger ? says Yahweh . Don 't they provoke themselves , to the confusion of their own faces ?
for I didn 't speak to your fathers , nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
but they didn 't listen nor turn their ear , but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart , and went backward , and not forward .
yet they didn 't listen to me , nor inclined their ear , but made their neck stiff : they did worse than their fathers .
you shall speak all these words to them ; but they will not listen to you : you shall also call to them ; but they will not answer you .
for the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight , says Yahweh : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it .
the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the earth ; and none shall frighten them away .
death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family , that remain in all the places where I have driven them , says Yahweh of Armies .
I listened and heard , but they didn 't speak aright : no man repents him of his wickedness , saying , What have I done ? everyone turns to his course , as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle .
yes , the stork in the sky knows her appointed times ; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming ; but my people don 't know Yahweh 's law .
how do you say , We are wise , and the law of Yahweh is with us ? but , behold , the false pen of the scribes has worked falsely .
the wise men are disappointed , they are dismayed and taken : behold , they have rejected the word of Yahweh ; and what kind of wisdom is in them ?
they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of healing , and behold , dismay !
for , behold , I will send Serpents , adders , among you , which will not be charmed ; and they shall bite you , says Yahweh .
Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow ! my heart is faint within me .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt : I mourn ; dismay has taken hold on me .
is there no balm in Gilead ? is there no physician there ? why then isn 't the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
Oh that my head were waters , and my eyes a spring of tears , that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they are all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
take heed everyone of his neighbor , and don 't trust in any brother ; for every brother will utterly supplant , and every neighbor will go about with slanders .
they will deceive everyone his neighbor , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies ; they weary themselves to commit iniquity .
their tongue is a deadly arrow ; it speaks deceit : one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth , but in his heart he lays wait for him .
Yahweh says , Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them , and have not obeyed my voice , neither walked therein ,
but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart , and after the Baals , which their fathers taught them ;
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
I will scatter them also among the nations , whom neither they nor their fathers have known ; and I will send the sword after them , until I have consumed them .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , consider , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for the skillful women , that they may come :
and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
for a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion , How are we ruined ! we are greatly confounded , because we have forsaken the land , because they have cast down our dwellings .
yet hear the word of Yahweh , you women , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth ; and teach your daughters wailing , and everyone her neighbor lamentation .
for death has come up into our windows , it is entered into our palaces ; to cut off the children from outside , and the young men from the streets .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will punish all those who are circumcised in uncircumcision :
for the customs of the peoples are vanity ; for one cuts a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman with the axe .
they deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it not move .
but Yahweh is the true God ; he is the living God , and an everlasting King : at his wrath the earth trembles , and the nations are not able to withstand his indignation .
you shall say this to them : the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth , these shall perish from the earth , and from under the heavens .
he has made the earth by his power , he has established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens :
every man has become brutish and without knowledge ; every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
they are vanity , a work of delusion : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
the portion of Jacob is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance : Yahweh of Armies is his name .
for thus says Yahweh , behold , I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time , and will distress them , that they may feel it .
Woe is me because of my hurt ! my wound is grievous : but I said , Truly this is my grief , and I must bear it .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
for the shepherds are become brutish , and have not inquired of Yahweh : therefore they have not prospered , and all their flocks are scattered .
the voice of news , behold , it comes , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the cities of Judah a desolation , a dwelling place of jackals .
Yahweh , I know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man who walks to direct his steps .
hear the words of this Covenant , and speak to the men of Judah , and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem ;
and say to them , Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : Cursed is the man who doesn 't hear the words of this Covenant ,
Yahweh said to me , proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , Hear the words of this Covenant , and do them .
Yahweh said to me , A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah , and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense : but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing , even altars to burn incense to Baal .
therefore don 't pray for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them ; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble .
Yahweh called your name , A green olive tree , beautiful with goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it , and its branches are broken .
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth , who seek your life , saying , You shall not prophesy in the name of Yahweh , that you not die by our hand ;
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , behold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine ;
and there shall be no remnant to them : for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
you have planted them , yes , they have taken root ; they grow , yes , they bring forth fruit : you are near in their mouth , and far from their heart .
but you , Yahweh , know me ; you see me , and try my heart toward you : pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare them for the day of slaughter .
for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt treacherously with you ; even they have cried aloud after you : Don 't believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
I have forsaken my house , I have cast off my heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
my heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest : she has uttered her voice against me ; therefore I have hated her .
is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey ? are the birds of prey against her all around ? go , assemble all the animals of the field , bring them to devour .
many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard , they have trodden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
they have made it a desolation ; it mourns to me , being desolate ; the whole land is made desolate , because no man lays it to heart .
Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness ; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh has peace .
it shall happen , after that I have plucked them up , I will return and have compassion on them ; and I will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
but if they will not hear , then will I pluck up that nation , plucking up and destroying it , says Yahweh .
so I bought a belt according to the word of Yahweh , and put it on my waist .
take the belt that you have bought , which is on your waist , and arise , go to the Euphrates , and hide it there in a cleft of the rock .
it happened after many days , that Yahweh said to me , arise , go to the Euphrates , and take the belt from there , which I commanded you to hide there .
then I went to the Euphrates , and dug , and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it ; and behold , the belt was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
but if you will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret for your pride ; and my eye shall weep bitterly , and run down with tears , because Yahweh 's flock is taken captive .
say to the king and to the queen mother , humble yourselves , sit down ; for your headdresses have come down , even the crown of your glory .
the cities of the South are shut up , and there is none to open them : Judah is carried away captive , all of it ; it is wholly carried away captive .
lift up your eyes , and see those who come from the north : where is the flock that was given you , your beautiful flock ?
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you ? shall not sorrows take hold of you , as of a woman in travail ?
if you say in your heart , Why are these things come on me ? for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered , and your heels suffer violence .
can the Ethiopian change his skin , or the Leopard his spots ? then may you also do good , who are accustomed to do evil .
therefore will I scatter them , as the stubble that passes away , by the wind of the wilderness .
therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face , and your shame shall appear .
because of the ground which is cracked , because no rain has been in the land , the plowmen are disappointed , they cover their heads .
yes , the hind also in the field calves , and forsakes her young , because there is no grass .
the wild donkeys stand on the bare heights , they pant for air like jackals ; their eyes fail , because there is no herbage .
we acknowledge , Yahweh , our wickedness , and the iniquity of our fathers ; for we have sinned against you .
do not abhor us , for your name 's sake ; do not disgrace the throne of your glory : remember , don 't break your Covenant with us .
I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have bereaved them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they didn 't return from their ways .
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday : I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly .
your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil without price , and that for all your sins , even in all your borders .
Yahweh , you know ; remember me , and visit me , and avenge me of my persecutors ; don 't take me away in your longsuffering : know that for your sake I have suffered reproach .
I didn 't sit in the assembly of those who make merry , nor rejoiced ; I sat alone because of your hand ; for you have filled me with indignation .
why is my pain perpetual , and my wound incurable , which refuses to be healed ? will you indeed be to me as a deceitful Brook , as waters that fail ?
I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked , and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible .
for thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who bore them , and concerning their fathers who became their father in this land :
both great and small shall die in this land ; they shall not be buried , neither shall men lament for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for them ;
you shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them , to eat and to drink .
and you have done evil more than your fathers ; for , behold , you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart , so that you don 't listen to me :
for my eyes are on all their ways ; they are not hidden from my face , neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes .
first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double , because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things , and have filled my inheritance with their abominations .
therefore behold , I will cause them to know , this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is Yahweh .
the sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it is engraved on the tablet of their heart , and on the horns of your altars ;
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , a salt land and not inhabited .
the heart is deceitful above all things , and it is exceedingly corrupt : who can know it ?
I , Yahweh , search the mind , I try the heart , even to give every man according to his ways , according to the fruit of his doings .
a glorious throne , set on high from the beginning , is the place of our sanctuary .
Yahweh , the hope of Israel , all who forsake you shall be disappointed . those who depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken Yahweh , the spring of living waters .
Don 't be a terror to me : you are my refuge in the day of evil .
and tell them , Hear the word of Yahweh , you kings of Judah , and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
thus says Yahweh , Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the Sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day holy , neither do any work : but make the Sabbath day , as I commanded your fathers .
but they didn 't listen , neither turn their ear , but made their neck stiff , that they might not hear , and might not receive instruction .
arise , and go down to the Potter 's house , and there I will cause you to hear my words .
then I went down to the Potter 's house , and behold , he was making a work on the wheels .
when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the Potter , he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the Potter to make it .
at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it ;
if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them .
at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant it ;
if they do that which is evil in my sight , that they not obey my voice , then I will repent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
but they say , It is in vain ; for we will walk after our own devices , and we will do everyone after the stubbornness of his evil heart .
shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field ? shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up ?
for my people have forgotten me , they have burned incense to false gods ; and they have been made to stumble in their ways , in the ancient paths , to walk in byways , in a way not built up ;
to make their land an astonishment , and a perpetual hissing ; everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished , and shake his head .
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will show them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
give heed to me , Yahweh , and listen to the voice of those who contend with me .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when you shall bring a troop suddenly on them ; for they have dug a pit to take me , and hid snares for my feet .
and go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is by the entry of the gate Harsith , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you ;
then you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who go with you ,
then came Jeremiah from Topheth , where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of Yahweh 's house , and said to all the people :
now Pashhur , the son of Immer the priest , who was chief officer in the house of Yahweh , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things .
then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yahweh .
it happened on the next day , that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks . then Jeremiah said to him , Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur , but Magormissabib .
but , Yahweh of Armies , who tests the righteous , who sees the heart and the mind , let me see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
sing to Yahweh , praise Yahweh ; for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers .
Cursed is the day in which I was born : Don 't let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed .
let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew , and didn 't repent : and let him hear a cry in the morning , and shouting at noontime ;
because he didn 't kill me from the womb ; and so my mother would have been my grave , and her womb always great .
why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow , that my days should be consumed with shame ?
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah , the priest , saying ,
I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation .
behold , I am against you , O inhabitant of the valley , and of the rock of the plain , says Yahweh ; you that say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?
thus said Yahweh : go down to the house of the king of Judah , and speak there this word ,
say , Hear the word of Yahweh , king of Judah , who sits on the throne of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
I will prepare destroyers against you , everyone with his weapons ; and they shall cut down your choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
but in the place where they have led him captive , there shall he die , and he shall see this land no more .
Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness , and his rooms by injustice ; who uses his neighbor 's service without wages , and doesn 't give him his hire ;
but your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness , and for shedding innocent blood , and for oppression , and for violence , to do it .
he shall be buried with the burial of a donkey , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
go up to Lebanon , and cry ; and lift up your voice in Bashan , and cry from Abarim ; for all your lovers are destroyed .
I spoke to you in your prosperity ; but you said , I will not hear . this has been your way from your youth , that you didn 't obey my voice .
the wind shall feed all your shepherds , and your lovers shall go into captivity : surely then you will be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness .
I will cast you out , and your mother who bore you , into another country , where you were not born ; and there you will die .
but to the land whereunto their soul longs to return , there shall they not return .
is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel ? is he a vessel in which none delights ? why are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into the land which they don 't know ?
I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and multiply .
I will set up shepherds over them , who shall feed them ; and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall any be lacking , says Yahweh .
in his days Judah shall be saved , and Israel shall dwell safely ; and this is his name by which he shall be called : Yahweh our righteousness .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that they shall no more say , As Yahweh lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
concerning the prophets . my heart within me is broken , all my bones shake ; I am like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Yahweh , and because of his holy words .
therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein ; for I will bring evil on them , even the year of their visitation , says Yahweh .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the prophets : behold , I will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink the water of gall ; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land .
they say continually to those who despise me , Yahweh has said , You shall have peace ; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say , No evil shall come on you .
for who has stood in the council of Yahweh , that he should perceive and hear his word ? who has marked my word , and heard it ?
behold , the storm of Yahweh , his wrath , has gone forth . yes , a whirling storm . it shall burst on the head of the wicked .
the anger of Yahweh shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the intents of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly .
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies , even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart ?
who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor , as their fathers forgot my name for Baal .
therefore behold , I am against the prophets , says Yahweh , who steal my words everyone from his neighbor .
as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , who shall say , The burden of Yahweh , I will even punish that man and his house .
therefore , behold , I will utterly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers , away from my presence :
and I will bring an everlasting reproach on you , and a perpetual shame , which shall not be forgotten .
one basket had very good figs , like the figs that are first @-@ ripe ; and the other basket had very bad figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : like these good figs , so will I regard the captives of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans , for good .
I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Yahweh : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God ; for they shall return to me with their whole heart .
I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among them , until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah ( the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) ,
which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah , and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying :
Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not listened , nor inclined your ear to hear )
and don 't go after other gods to serve them or worship them , and don 't provoke me to anger with the work of your hands ; and I will do you no harm .
I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations .
they shall drink , and reel back and forth , and be mad , because of the sword that I will send among them .
then took I the cup at Yahweh 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , to whom Yahweh had sent me :
Pharaoh king of Egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the Uz , and all the kings of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Gaza , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ;
and all the kings of Tyre , and all the kings of Sidon , and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea ;
Dedan , and TEMA , and Buz , and all who have the corners of their beard cut off ;
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness ;
and all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of the Medes ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the kingdoms of the world , which are on the surface of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink , then you shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh of Armies : you shall surely drink .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great storm shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
Wail , you shepherds , and cry ; and wallow in dust , you principal of the flock ; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come , and you shall fall like a goodly vessel .
the shepherds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and the wailing of the principal of the flock ! for Yahweh lays waste their pasture .
he has left his covert , as the lion ; for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression , and because of his fierce anger .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word from Yahweh , saying ,
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his evil way ; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings .
to listen to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I send to you , even rising up early and sending them , but you have not listened ;
the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Yahweh .
then spoke Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people , saying , Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard .
now therefore amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of Yahweh your God ; and Yahweh will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you .
but as for me , behold , I am in your hand : do with me as is good and right in your eyes .
then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets : this man is not worthy of death ; for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God .
then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spoke to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
there was also a man who prophesied in the name of Yahweh , Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim ; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah :
and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , Elnathan the son of Achbor , and certain men with him , into Egypt ;
and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt , and brought him to Jehoiakim the king , who killed him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
but the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
and give them a command to their masters , saying , Thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , You shall tell your masters :
I have made the earth , the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth , by my great power and by my outstretched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
all the nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the time of his own land come : and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondservant .
for they prophesy a lie to you , to remove you far from your land , and that I should drive you out , and you should perish .
I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words , saying , Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serve him and his people , and live .
Don 't listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon ; for they prophesy a lie to you .
they shall be carried to Babylon , and there shall they be , until the day that I visit them , says Yahweh ; then will I bring them up , and restore them to this place .
thus speaks Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , saying , I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon .
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried to Babylon :
then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yahweh ,
nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears , and in the ears of all the people :
the prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
the prophet who prophesies of peace , when the word of the prophet shall happen , then shall the prophet be known , that Yahweh has truly sent him .
then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah 's neck , and broke it .
then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
go , and tell Hananiah , saying , Thus says Yahweh : you have broken the bars of wood ; but you have made in their place bars of iron .
therefore thus says Yahweh , behold , I will send you away from off the surface of the earth : this year you shall die , because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh .
( after that Jeconiah the king , the queen mother , the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , the craftsmen , and the Smiths , had departed from Jerusalem ) ,
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) , saying ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , to all the captivity , whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon :
seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive , and pray to Yahweh for it ; for in its peace you shall have peace .
for thus says Yahweh , After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon , I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
you shall call on me , and you shall go and pray to me , and I will listen to you .
you shall seek me , and find me , when you shall search for me with all your heart .
thus says Yahweh of Armies ; behold , I will send on them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like vile figs , that can 't be eaten , they are so bad .
because they have not listened to my words , says Yahweh , with which I sent to them my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ; but you would not hear , says Yahweh .
hear therefore the word of Yahweh , all you of the captivity , whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon .
now therefore , why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth , who makes himself a prophet to you ,
because he has sent to us in Babylon , saying , The captivity is long : build houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat their fruit ?
thus speaks Yahweh , the God of Israel , saying , Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book .
but they shall serve Yahweh their God , and David their king , whom I will raise up to them .
there is none to plead your cause , that you may be bound up : you have no healing medicines .
why do you cry for your hurt ? your pain is incurable : for the greatness of your iniquity , because your sins were increased , I have done these things to you .
out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
their children also shall be as before , and their Congregation shall be established before me ; and I will punish all who oppress them .
behold , the storm of Yahweh , his wrath , has gone forth , a sweeping storm : it shall burst on the head of the wicked .
the fierce anger of Yahweh will not return , until he has executed , and until he has performed the intentions of his heart . in the latter days you will understand it .
Yahweh appeared of old to me , saying , Yes , I have loved you with an everlasting love : therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you .
again you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria ; the planters shall plant , and shall enjoy its fruit .
for there shall be a day , that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry , arise , and let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God .
for Yahweh has ransomed Jacob , and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he .
I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my Goodness , says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : a voice is heard in Ramah , lamentation , and bitter weeping , Rachel weeping for her children ; she refuses to be comforted for her children , because they are no more .
thus says Yahweh : refrain your voice from weeping , and your eyes from tears ; for your work shall be rewarded , says Yahweh ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
there is hope for your latter end , says Yahweh ; and your children shall come again to their own border .
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus , You have chastised me , and I was chastised , as an untrained calf : turn me , and I shall be turned ; for you are Yahweh my God .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I struck on my thigh : I was ashamed , yes , even confounded , because I bore the reproach of my youth .
how long will you go here and there , you backsliding daughter ? for Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth : a woman shall encompass a man .
Judah and all its cities shall dwell therein together , the farmers , and those who go about with flocks .
on this I awakened , and saw ; and my sleep was sweet to me .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of animal .
it shall happen that , like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , says Yahweh .
in those days they shall say no more , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge .
but everyone shall die for his own iniquity : every man who eats the sour grapes , his teeth shall be set on edge .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that the city shall be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner .
the measuring line shall go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb , and shall turn about to Goah .
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar .
and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon , and he shall be there until I visit him , says Yahweh : though you fight with the Chaldeans , you shall not prosper ?
behold , Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you , saying , Buy my field that is in Anathoth ; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it .
I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle 's son , and weighed him the money , even seventeen shekels of silver .
I subscribed the deed , and sealed it , and called witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balances .
so I took the deed of the purchase , both that which was sealed , containing the terms and conditions , and that which was open ;
now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah , I prayed to Yahweh , saying ,
Ah Lord Yahweh ! behold , you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm ; there is nothing too hard for you ,
who show loving kindness to thousands , and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them ; the great , the mighty God , Yahweh of Armies is his name ;
who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , even to this day , both in Israel and among other men ; and made yourself a name , as in this day ;
and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror ;
and gave them this land , which you swore to their fathers to give them , a land flowing with milk and honey ;
behold , I am Yahweh , the God of all flesh : is there anything too hard for me ?
therefore thus says Yahweh : behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
but they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it .
and I will give them one heart and one way , that they may fear me forever , for their good , and of their children after them :
yes , I will rejoice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
for thus says Yahweh : like as I have brought all this great evil on this people , so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them .
fields shall be bought in this land , about which you say , It is desolate , without man or animal ; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
call to me , and I will answer you , and will show you great things , and difficult , which you don 't know .
I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , by which they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , by which they have sinned against me , and by which they have transgressed against me .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : yet again shall there be in this place , which is waste , without man and without animal , and in all its cities , a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah .
in those days , and at that time , will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David ; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land .
in those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely ; and this is the name by which she shall be called : Yahweh our righteousness .
for thus says Yahweh : David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel ;
neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings , and to burn meal offerings , and to do sacrifice continually .
Don 't consider what this people has spoken , saying , The two families which Yahweh chose , he has cast them off ? thus do they despise my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem ,
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that the king Zedekiah had made a Covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty to them ;
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess , go free ; that none should make bondservants of them , of a Jew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : I made a Covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage , saying ,
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , and his brothers , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ;
I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine , and cups ; and I said to them , Drink wine !
we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , in all that he commanded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , or our daughters ;
nor to build houses for us to dwell in ; neither have we vineyard , nor field , nor seed :
but we have lived in tents , and have obeyed , and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : go , and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words ? says Yahweh .
because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them , but this people has not listened to me ;
it happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , that this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
Jeremiah commanded Baruch , saying , I am shut up ; I can 't go into the house of Yahweh :
Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him , reading in the book the words of Yahweh in Yahweh 's house .
when Micaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of Yahweh ,
then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
now it happened , when they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said to Baruch , We will surely tell the king of all these words .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe ; and they told all the words in the ears of the king .
now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him .
they were not afraid , nor tore their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants who heard all these words .
moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll ; but he would not hear them .
then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the scroll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
take again another scroll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll , which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned .
Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king , instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , listened to the words of Yahweh , which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah .
Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah , the priest , to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , pray now to Yahweh our God for us .
now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people ; for they had not put him into prison .
Pharaoh 's army had come forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them , they broke up from Jerusalem .
then came the word of Yahweh to the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
the Chaldeans shall come again , and fight against this city ; and they shall take it , and burn it with fire .
for though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yes would they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
it happened that , when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
then Jeremiah said , It is false ; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans . but he didn 't listen to him ; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah , and brought him to the princes .
the princes were angry with Jeremiah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe ; for they had made that the prison .
when Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house , and into the cells , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ;
moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah , Wherein have I sinned against you , or against your servants , or against this people , that you have put me in prison ?
where now are your prophets who prophesied to you , saying , The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
so they drew up Jeremiah with the cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh : and the king said to Jeremiah , I will ask you something . hide nothing from me .
then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , If I declare it to you , will you not surely put me to death ? and if I give you counsel , you will not listen to me .
but if you refuse to go forth , this is the word that Yahweh has shown me :
then you shall tell them , I presented my supplication before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan 's house , to die there .
then came all the princes to Jeremiah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , a breach was made in the city ) ,
then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah .
moreover he put out Zedekiah 's eyes , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to Babylon .
the Chaldeans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city , the deserters also who fell away to him , and the residue of the people who remained .
but Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
so Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent , and Nebushazban , Rabsaris , and Nergal Sharezer , Rabmag , and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon ;
they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
now the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yahweh ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will surely save you , and you shall not fall by the sword , but your life shall be for a prey to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yahweh .
then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah , and lived with him among the people who were left in the land .
then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven , and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah , to Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits very much .
moreover Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields , came to Gedaliah to Mizpah ,
and said to him , Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life ? but Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn 't believe them .
but Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah , You shall not do this thing ; for you speak falsely of Ishmael .
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him , with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans who were found there , the men of war .
it happened the second day after he had killed Gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men who were with him .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
now it happened that , when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
so all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back , and went to Johanan the son of Kareah .
but Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men , and went to the children of Ammon .
that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk , and the thing that we should do .
then they said to Jeremiah , Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us , if we don 't do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God shall send you to us .
it happened after ten days , that the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
and said to them , Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him :
Don 't be afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom you are afraid ; don 't be afraid of him , says Yahweh : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
but if you say , We will not dwell in this land ; so that you don 't obey the voice of Yahweh your God ,
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
now therefore hear the word of Yahweh , O remnant of Judah : thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to live there ;
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place where you desire to go to live there .
it happened that , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God , with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Judah ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh : and they came to Tahpanhes .
then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes , saying ,
take great stones in your hand , and hide them in mortar in the brick work , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
however I sent to you all my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them , saying , Oh , don 't do this abominable thing that I hate .
but they didn 't listen , nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness , to burn no incense to other gods .
they are not humbled even to this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will set my face against you for evil , even to cut off all Judah .
for I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
as for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh , we will not listen to you .
but since we left off burning incense to the queen of the sky , and pouring out drink offerings to her , we have wanted all things , and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine .
then Jeremiah said to all the people , to the men , and to the women , even to all the people who had given him an answer , saying ,
behold , I watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until they are all gone .
this shall be the sign to you , says Yahweh , that I will punish you in this place , that you may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil :
the word of Yahweh which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations .
of Egypt : concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah .
harness the horses , and get up , you horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , put on the coats of mail .
why have I seen it ? they are dismayed and are turned backward ; and their mighty ones are beaten down , and have fled Apace , and don 't look back : terror is on every side , says Yahweh .
Don 't let the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen .
who is this who rises up like the Nile , whose waters Toss themselves like the rivers ?
go up , you horses ; and rage , you chariots ; and let the mighty men go forth : Cush and Put , who handle the shield ; and the Ludim , who handle and bend the bow .
the nations have heard of your shame , and the earth is full of your cry ; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty , they are fallen both of them together .
the word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet , how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt .
declare in Egypt , and publish in Migdol , and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes : say , Stand forth , and prepare ; for the sword has devoured around you .
they cried there , Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise ; he has let the appointed time pass by .
you daughter who dwells in Egypt , furnish yourself to go into captivity ; for Memphis shall become a desolation , and shall be burnt up , without inhabitant .
Egypt is a very beautiful heifer ; but destruction out of the north has come , it has come .
the sound of it shall go like the serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as wood cutters .
they shall cut down her forest , says Yahweh , though it can 't be searched ; because they are more than the locusts , and are innumerable .
the daughter of Egypt shall be disappointed ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines , before that Pharaoh struck Gaza .
Baldness has come on Gaza ; Ashkelon is brought to nothing , the remnant of their valley : how long will you cut yourself ?
you sword of Yahweh , how long will it be before you be quiet ? put up yourself into your scabbard ; rest , and be still .
how can you be quiet , since Yahweh has given you a command ? against Ashkelon , and against the seashore , there has he appointed it .
Moab is destroyed ; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard .
for by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up ; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction .
the destroyer shall come on every city , and no city shall escape ; the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed ; as Yahweh has spoken .
give wings to Moab , that she may fly and get her away : and her cities shall become a desolation , without any to dwell therein .
Cursed is he who does the work of Yahweh negligently ; and Cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will send to him those who pour off , and they shall pour him off ; and they shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles in pieces .
Moab is laid waste , and they are gone up into his cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , says the King , whose name is Yahweh of Armies .
all you who are around him , bemoan him , and all you who know his name ; say , How is the strong staff broken , the beautiful rod !
Moab is disappointed ; for it is broken down : wail and cry ; tell it by the Arnon , that Moab is laid waste .
judgment has come on the plain country , on Holon , and on Jahzah , and on Mephaath ,
make him drunken ; for he magnified himself against Yahweh : and Moab shall wallow in his vomit , and he also shall be in derision .
for wasn 't Israel a derision to you ? was he found among thieves ? for as often as you speak of him , you shake your head .
you inhabitants of Moab , leave the cities , and dwell in the rock ; and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss .
we have heard of the pride of Moab . he is very proud ; his loftiness , and his pride , and his arrogance , and the haughtiness of his heart .
therefore will I wail for Moab ; yes , I will cry out for all Moab : for the men of Kir Heres shall they mourn .
from the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh , even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice , from Zoar even to Horonaim , to Eglath Shelishiyah : for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate .
moreover I will cause to cease in Moab , says Yahweh , him who offers in the high place , and him who burns incense to his gods .
for every head is bald , and every beard clipped : on all the hands are cuttings , and on the waist sackcloth .
on all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation every where ; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which none delights , says Yahweh .
Kerioth is taken , and the strongholds are seized , and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
Woe to you , O Moab ! the people of Chemosh is undone ; for your sons are taken away captive , and your daughters into captivity .
why do you glory in the valleys , your flowing valley , backsliding daughter ? who trusted in her treasures , saying , Who shall come to me ?
flee , turn back , dwell in the depths , inhabitants of Dedan ; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him , the time that I shall visit him .
if grape gatherers came to you , would they not leave some gleaning grapes ? if thieves by night , wouldn 't they destroy until they had enough ?
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neighbors ; and he is no more .
I have heard news from Yahweh , and an ambassador is sent among the nations , saying , Gather yourselves together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
as in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it , says Yahweh , no man shall dwell there , neither shall any son of man live therein .
the earth trembles at the noise of their fall ; there is a cry , the noise which is heard in the Red Sea .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread out his wings against Bozrah : and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
of Damascus . Hamath is confounded , and Arpad ; for they have heard evil news , they are melted away : there is sorrow on the sea ; it can 't be quiet .
Damascus has grown feeble , she turns herself to flee , and trembling has seized on her : anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her , as of a woman in travail .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day , says Yahweh of Armies .
of Kedar , and of the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck . thus says Yahweh : arise , go up to Kedar , and destroy the children of the east .
their tents and their flocks shall they take ; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their camels ; and they shall cry to them , Terror on every side !
flee , wander far off , dwell in the depths , you inhabitants of Hazor , says Yahweh ; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you , and has conceived a purpose against you .
Hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals , a desolation forever : no man shall dwell there , neither shall any son of man live therein .
the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
and I will set my throne in Elam , and will destroy from there king and princes , says Yahweh .
but it shall happen in the latter days , that I will bring back the captivity of Elam , says Yahweh .
the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon , concerning the land of the Chaldeans , by Jeremiah the prophet .
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
they shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it , saying , Come , and join yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting Covenant that shall not be forgotten .
my people have been lost sheep : their shepherds have caused them to go astray ; they have turned them away on the mountains ; they have gone from mountain to hill ; they have forgotten their resting place .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans , and be as the male goats before the flocks .
because you are glad , because you rejoice , O you who plunder my heritage , because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain , and neigh as strong horses ;
your mother shall be utterly disappointed ; she who bore you shall be confounded : behold , she shall be the least of the nations , a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited , but she shall be wholly desolate : everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .
set yourselves in array against Babylon all around , all you who bend the bow ; shoot at her , spare no arrows : for she has sinned against Yahweh .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
Israel is a hunted sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first , the king of Assyria devoured him ; and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
I will bring Israel again to his pasture , and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan , and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead .
go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : kill and utterly destroy after them , says Yahweh , and do according to all that I have commanded you .
how is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken ! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations !
I have laid a snare for you , and you are also taken , Babylon , and you weren 't aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have striven against Yahweh .
Yahweh has opened his armory , and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation ; for the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans .
kill all her bulls ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe to them ! for their day has come , the time of their visitation .
the voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God , the vengeance of his temple .
therefore her young men will fall in her streets , and all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day , says Yahweh .
the proud one shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up ; and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all who are around him .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : the children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together ; and all who took them captive hold them fast ; they refuse to let them go .
a sword is on the boasters , and they shall become fools ; a sword is on her mighty men , and they shall be dismayed .
a drought is on her waters , and they shall be dried up ; for it is a land of engraved images , and they are mad over idols .
as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it , says Yahweh , so shall no man dwell there , neither shall any son of man live therein .
behold , a people comes from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
the king of Babylon has heard the news of them , and his hands wax feeble : anguish has taken hold of him , pains as of a woman in labor .
I will send to Babylon strangers , who shall winnow her ; and they shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around .
against him who bends let the archer bend his bow , and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail : and don 't spare her young men ; utterly destroy all her army .
they shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans , and thrust through in her streets .
for Israel is not forsaken , nor Judah , of his God , of Yahweh of Armies ; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don 't be cut off in her iniquity : for it is the time of Yahweh 's vengeance ; he will render to her a recompense .
Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh 's hand , who made all the earth drunken : the nations have drunk of her wine ; therefore the nations are mad .
Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed : wail for her ; take balm for her pain , if so be she may be healed .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go everyone into his own country ; for her judgment reaches to heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself , saying , surely I will fill you with men , as with the canker worm ; and they shall lift up a shout against you .
he has made the earth by his power , he has established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens :
every man has become brutish without knowledge . every goldsmith is disappointed by his image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
they are vanity , a work of delusion : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
the portion of Jacob is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and is the tribe of his inheritance : Yahweh of Armies is his name .
you are my battle axe and weapons of war : and with you will I break in pieces the nations ; and with you will I destroy kingdoms ;
I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight , says Yahweh .
they shall not take of you a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but you shall be desolate for ever , says Yahweh .
prepare against her the nations , the kings of the Medes , its governors , and all its deputies , and all the land of their dominion .
the land trembles and is in pain ; for the purposes of Yahweh against Babylon do stand , to make the land of Babylon a desolation , without inhabitant .
therefore thus says Yahweh : behold , I will plead your cause , and take vengeance for you ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her fountain dry .
when they are heated , I will make their feast , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , says Yahweh .
the sea has come up on Babylon ; she is covered with the multitude of its waves .
her cities are become a desolation , a dry land , and a desert , a land in which no man dwells , neither does any son of man pass thereby .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be confounded ; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
then the heavens and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for joy over Babylon ; for the destroyers shall come to her from the north , says Yahweh .
you who have escaped the sword , go , don 't stand still ; remember Yahweh from afar , and let Jerusalem come into your mind .
we are confounded , because we have heard reproach ; confusion has covered our faces : for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Yahweh 's house .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will execute judgment on her engraved images ; and through all her land the wounded shall groan .
though Babylon should mount up to the sky , and though she should fortify the height of her strength , yet from me shall destroyers come to her , says Yahweh .
the sound of a cry from Babylon , and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans !
for Yahweh lays Babylon waste , and destroys out of her the great voice ; and their waves roar like many waters ; the noise of their voice is uttered :
for the destroyer has come on her , even on Babylon , and her mighty men are taken , their bows are broken in pieces ; for Yahweh is a God of recompenses , he will surely requite .
Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon , even all these words that are written concerning Babylon .
and say , Yahweh , you have spoken concerning this place , to cut it off , that none shall dwell therein , neither man nor animal , but that it shall be desolate forever .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of Yahweh it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath ; and he gave judgment on him .
the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes : he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
and he burned the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
all the army of the Chaldeans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around .
but Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers .
the Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
they also took away the pots , the shovels , the snuffers , the basins , the spoons , and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered .
the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the threshold :
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
this is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand twenty @-@ three Jews ;
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty @-@ two persons ;
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty @-@ five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and he spoke kindly to him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon ,
she weeps bitterly in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they are become her enemies .
Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude ; she dwells among the nations , she finds no rest : all her persecutors overtook her within the straits .
the ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn assembly ; all her gates are desolate , her priests do sigh : her virgins are afflicted , and she herself is in bitterness .
from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
Jerusalem has grievously sinned ; therefore she has become as an unclean thing ; all who honored her despise her , because they have seen her nakedness : yes , she sighs , and turns backward .
her filthiness was in her skirts ; she didn 't remember her latter end ; therefore is she come down wonderfully ; she has no comforter : see , Yahweh , my affliction ; for the enemy has magnified himself .
the adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary , concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly .
for these things I weep ; my eye , my eye runs down with water ; Because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me : my children are desolate , because the enemy has prevailed .
Yahweh is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment : please hear all you peoples , and see my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city , While they sought them food to refresh their souls .
let all their wickedness come before you ; Do to them , as you have done to me for all my transgressions : for my sighs are many , and my heart is faint .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger ! he has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel , And hasn 't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger .
he has cut off in fierce anger all the Horn of Israel ; He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy : he has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire , which devours all around .
the Lord has become as an enemy , he has swallowed up Israel ; He has swallowed up all her palaces , he has destroyed his strongholds ; He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
the elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground , they keep silence ; They have cast up dust on their heads ; they have clothed themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
they tell their mothers , Where is grain and wine ? when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city , When their soul is poured out into their mothers ' bosom .
your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions ; They have not uncovered your iniquity , to bring back your captivity , but have seen for you false oracles and causes of banishment .
look , Yahweh , and see to whom you have done thus ! shall the women eat their fruit , the children that are dandled in the hands ? shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
I am the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath .
he has led me and caused me to walk in darkness , and not in light .
my flesh and my skin has he made old ; he has broken my bones .
he has made me to dwell in dark places , as those that have been long dead .
he has walled me about , that I can 't go forth ; he has made my chain heavy .
he has walled up my ways with cut stone ; he has made my paths crooked .
he has turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces ; he has made me desolate .
he has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys .
you have removed my soul far off from peace ; I forgot prosperity .
my soul still remembers them , and is bowed down within me .
this I recall to my mind ; therefore have I hope .
Yahweh is good to those who wait for him , to the soul that seeks him .
it is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh .
it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth .
let him put his mouth in the dust , if so be there may be hope .
let him give his cheek to him who strikes him ; let him be filled full with reproach .
for though he cause grief , yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses .
for he does not afflict willingly , nor grieve the children of men .
to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High ,
to subvert a man in his cause , the Lord doesn 't approve .
who is he who says , and it comes to pass , when the Lord doesn 't command it ?
let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens .
you have covered with anger and pursued us ; you have killed , you have not pitied .
you have covered yourself with a cloud , so that no prayer can pass through .
you have made us an off @-@ scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples .
my eye runs down with streams of water , for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
my eye pours down , and doesn 't cease , without any intermission ,
my eye affects my soul , because of all the daughters of my city .
they have cut off my life in the dungeon , and have cast a stone on me .
you drew near in the day that I called on you ; you said , Don 't be afraid .
Lord , you have pleaded the causes of my soul ; you have redeemed my life .
you see their sitting down , and their rising up ; I am their song .
you will render to them a recompense , Yahweh , according to the work of their hands .
how the gold has become dim ! the most pure gold has changed ! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street .
the precious sons of Zion , comparable to fine gold , How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the Potter !
even the jackals draw out the breast , they nurse their young ones : the daughter of my people has become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
the tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
her nobles were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk ; They were more ruddy in body than rubies , their polishing was as of sapphire .
their appearance is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin clings to their bones ; it is withered , it has become like a stick .
those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these pine away , stricken through , for want of the fruits of the field .
the hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Yahweh has accomplished his wrath , he has poured out his fierce anger ; He has kindled a fire in Zion , which has devoured its foundations .
it is because of the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her .
they wander as blind men in the streets , they are polluted with blood , So that men can 't touch their garments .
the anger of Yahweh has scattered them ; he will no more regard them : they didn 't respect the persons of the priests , they didn 't favor the elders .
our eyes still fail , looking in vain for our help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save .
they hunt our steps , so that we can 't go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end has come .
our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky : they chased us on the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
the breath of our nostrils , the anointed of Yahweh , was taken in their pits ; Of whom we said , Under his shadow we shall live among the nations .
rejoice and be glad , daughter of Edom , that dwell in the land of Uz : the cup shall pass through to you also ; you shall be drunken , and shall make yourself naked .
the punishment of your iniquity is accomplished , daughter of Zion ; he will no more carry you away into captivity : he will visit your iniquity , daughter of Edom ; he will uncover your sins .
our pursuers are on our necks : we are weary , and have no rest .
we have given the hand to the Egyptians , To the Assyrians , to be satisfied with bread .
we get our bread at the peril of our lives , Because of the sword of the wilderness .
our skin is black like an oven , Because of the burning heat of famine .
princes were hanged up by their hand : the faces of elders were not honored .
the joy of our heart is ceased ; Our dance is turned into mourning .
for the mountain of Zion , which is desolate : the foxes walk on it .
turn us to yourself , Yahweh , and we shall be turned . renew our days as of old .
now it happened in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
in the fifth of the month , which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin 's captivity ,
out of its midst came the likeness of four living creatures . this was their appearance : they had the likeness of a man .
their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot ; and they sparkled like burnished brass .
they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and the four of them had their faces and their wings thus :
their wings were joined one to another ; they didn 't turn when they went ; each one went straight forward .
each one went straight forward : where the spirit was to go , they went ; they didn 't turn when they went .
now as I saw the living creatures , behold , one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures , for each of the four faces of it .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl : and the four of them had one likeness ; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel .
when they went , they went in their four directions : they didn 't turn when they went .
as for their rims , they were high and dreadful ; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around .
when the living creatures went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
wherever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the wheels were lifted up beside them ; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse , like the awesome crystal to look on , stretched forth over their heads above .
there was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads : when they stood , they let down their wings .
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above .
the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me , and set me on my feet ; and I heard him who spoke to me .
the children are impudent and stiff @-@ hearted : I am sending you to them ; and you shall tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh .
you shall speak my words to them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear ; for they are most rebellious .
but you , son of man , hear what I tell you ; don 't be rebellious like that rebellious house : open your mouth , and eat that which I give you .
when I looked , behold , a hand was put forth to me ; and , behold , a scroll of a book was therein ;
he spread it before me : and it was written within and without ; and there were written therein lamentations , and mourning , and woe .
he said to me , Son of man , cause your belly to eat , and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you . then I ate it ; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth .
he said to me , Son of man , go to the house of Israel , and speak my words to them .
for you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language , but to the house of Israel ;
not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . surely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
but the house of Israel will not listen to you ; for they will not listen to me : for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard @-@ hearted .
behold , I have made your face hard against their faces , and your forehead hard against their foreheads .
as an adamant harder than Flint have I made your forehead : Don 't be afraid of them , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they are a rebellious house .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart , and hear with your ears .
go to them of the captivity , to the children of your people , and speak to them , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
then the Spirit lifted me up , and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing , saying , blessed be the glory of Yahweh from his place .
I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another , and the noise of the wheels beside them , even the noise of a great rushing .
so the Spirit lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me .
then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv , that lived by the river Chebar , and to where they lived ; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days .
it happened at the end of seven days , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel : therefore hear the word from my mouth , and give them warning from me .
yet if you warn the wicked , and he doesn 't turn from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but you have delivered your soul .
nevertheless if you warn the righteous man , that the righteous not sin , and he does not sin , he shall surely live , because he took warning ; and you have delivered your soul .
the hand of Yahweh was there on me ; and he said to me , arise , go forth into the plain , and I will there talk with you .
but you , son of man , behold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bind you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a reprover ; for they are a rebellious house .
you also , son of man , take a tile , and lay it before yourself , and portray on it a city , even Jerusalem :
and lay siege against it , and build forts against it , and cast up a mound against it ; set camps also against it , and plant battering rams against it all around .
for I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days , even three hundred ninety days : so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem , with your arm uncovered ; and you shall prophesy against it .
behold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
your food which you shall eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day : from time to time you shall eat it .
you shall drink water by measure , the sixth part of a hin : from time to time you shall drink .
Yahweh said , Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean , among the nations where I will drive them .
that they may want bread and water , and be dismayed one with another , and pine away in their iniquity .
you shall take of it a few in number , and bind them in your skirts .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : this is Jerusalem ; I have set her in the midst of the nations , and countries are around her .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations .
I will do in you that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all your abominations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter to all the winds .
moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you , in the sight of all that pass by .
your altars shall become desolate , and your incense altars shall be broken ; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols .
I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones around your altars .
yet will I leave a remnant , in that you shall have some that escape the sword among the nations , when you shall be scattered through the countries .
they shall know that I am Yahweh : I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them .
he who is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
you , son of man , thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel , An end : the end has come on the four corners of the land .
now is the end on you , and I will send my anger on you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
your doom has come to you , inhabitant of the land : the time has come , the day is near , a day of tumult , and not of joyful shouting , on the mountains .
now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you , and accomplish my anger against you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
behold , the day , behold , it comes : your doom is gone forth ; the rod has blossomed , pride has budded .
the time has come , the day draws near : Don 't let the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn ; for wrath is on all its multitude .
they have blown the trumpet , and have made all ready ; but none goes to the battle ; for my wrath is on all its multitude .
all hands shall be feeble , and all knees shall be weak as water .
they shall also clothe themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be on all faces , and baldness on all their heads .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty ; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing .
I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall profane it .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall profane my secret place ; and robbers shall enter into it , and profane it .
make the chain ; for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
therefore I will bring the worst of the nations , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pride of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be profaned .
destruction comes ; and they shall seek peace , and there shall be none .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the appearance that I saw in the plain .
he brought me to the door of the court ; and when I looked , behold , a hole in the wall .
then he said to me , Son of man , dig now in the wall : and when I had dug in the wall , behold , a door .
so I went in and saw ; and see , every form of creeping things , and abominable animals , and all the idols of the house of Israel , portrayed around on the wall .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh 's house which was toward the north ; and see , there sat the women weeping for Tammuz .
to the others he said in my hearing , Go through the city after him , and strike : Don 't let your eye spare , neither have pity ;
as for me also , my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will bring their way on their head .
behold , the man clothed in linen , who had the inkhorn by his side , reported the matter , saying , I have done as you have commanded me .
then I looked , and see , in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
the glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh 's glory .
the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court , as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks .
there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man 's hand under their wings .
I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the cherubim , one wheel beside one cherub , and another wheel beside another cherub ; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone .
as for their appearance , the four of them had one likeness , like a wheel within a wheel .
when they went , they went in their four directions : they didn 't turn as they went , but to the place where the head looked they followed it ; they didn 't turn as they went .
as for the wheels , they were called in my hearing , the whirling wheels .
when the cherubim went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the wheels also didn 't turn from beside them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they mounted up , these mounted up with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
the glory of Yahweh went forth from over the threshold of the house , and stood over the cherubim .
this is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar ; and I knew that they were cherubim .
every one had four faces , and every one four wings ; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
as for the likeness of their faces , they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar , their appearances and themselves ; they went every one straight forward .
the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me , and he said to me , Speak , Thus says Yahweh : thus you have said , house of Israel ; for I know the things that come into your mind .
you have multiplied your slain in this city , and you have filled its streets with the slain .
you have feared the sword ; and I will bring the sword on you , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will bring you forth out of its midst , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
you shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
this shall not be your caldron , neither shall you be the meat in its midst ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ;
and you shall know that I am Yahweh : for you have not walked in my statutes , neither have you executed my ordinances , but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you .
therefore say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will gather you from the peoples , and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
they shall come there , and they shall take away all the detestable things of it and all its abominations from there .
that they may walk in my statutes , and keep my ordinances , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
but as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
then the cherubim lifted up their wings , and the wheels were beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
you shall bring forth your stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for moving ; and you shall go forth yourself at even in their sight , as when men go forth into exile .
say , I am your sign : like as I have done , so shall it be done to them ; they shall go into exile , into captivity .
I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall disperse them among the nations , and scatter them through the countries .
son of man , eat your bread with quaking , and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness ;
the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be a desolation ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
son of man , what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel , saying , The days are prolonged , and every vision fails ?
for there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel .
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he sees is for many day to come , and he prophesies of times that are far off .
you have not gone up into the gaps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yahweh .
they have seen falsehood and lying divination , who say , Yahweh says ; but Yahweh has not sent them : and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed .
haven 't you seen a false vision , and haven 't you spoken a lying divination , in that you say , Yahweh says ; but I have not spoken ?
because , even because they have seduced my people , saying , Peace ; and there is no peace ; and when one builds up a wall , behold , they plaster it with whitewash :
tell those who plaster it with whitewash , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and you , great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall tear it .
behold , when the wall has fallen , shall it not be said to you , Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it ?
you , son of man , set your face against the daughters of your people , who prophesy out of their own heart ; and prophesy against them ,
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , and be saved alive :
therefore you shall no more see false visions , nor practice divination . I will deliver my people out of your hand ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
then came certain of the elders of Israel to me , and sat before me .
son of man , these men have taken their idols into their heart , and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face : should I be inquired of at all by them ?
that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart , because they are all estranged from me through their idols .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : return , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your abominations .
if the prophet is deceived and speak a word , I , Yahweh , have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand on him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
they shall bear their iniquity : the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him who seeks him ;
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , says the Lord Yahweh .
if I cause evil animals to pass through the land , and they ravage it , and it be made desolate , so that no man may pass through because of the animals ;
or if I bring a sword on that land , and say , sword , go through the land ; so that I cut off from it man and animal ;
though these three men were in it , as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , they should deliver neither sons nor daughters , but they only should be delivered themselves .
or if I send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my wrath on it in blood , to cut off from it man and animal ;
though Noah , Daniel , and Job , were in it , as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , they should deliver neither son nor daughter ; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
son of man , what is the vine tree more than any tree , the vine @-@ branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
shall wood be taken of it to make any work ? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon ?
behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire has devoured both its ends , and its midst is burned : is it profitable for any work ?
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem : your birth and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite ; the Amorite was your father , and your mother was a Hittite .
as for your birth , in the day you were born your navel was not cut , neither were you washed in water to cleanse you ; you weren 't salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
when I passed by you , and saw you wallowing in your blood , I said to you , Though you are in your blood , live ; yes , I said to you , Though you are in your blood , live .
then washed I you with water ; yes , I thoroughly washed away your blood from you , and I anointed you with oil .
I clothed you also with embroidered work , and shod you with sealskin , and I dressed you about with fine linen , and covered you with silk .
I decked you with ornaments , and I put bracelets on your hands , and a chain on your neck .
I put a ring on your nose , and earrings in your ears , and a beautiful crown on your head .
your renown went forth among the nations for your beauty ; for it was perfect , through my majesty which I had put on you , says the Lord Yahweh .
but you trusted in your beauty , and played the prostitute because of your renown , and poured out your prostitution on everyone who passed by ; his it was .
you also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yourself images of men , and played the prostitute with them ;
and you took your embroidered garments , and covered them , and set my oil and my incense before them .
moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters , whom you have borne to me , and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured . was your prostitution a small matter ,
that you have slain my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through [ the fire ] to them ?
in all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth , when you were naked and bare , and were wallowing in your blood .
that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place , and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street .
you have built your lofty place at the head of every way , and have made your beauty an abomination , and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by , and multiplied your prostitution .
you have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians , your neighbors , great of flesh ; and have multiplied your prostitution , to provoke me to anger .
you have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians , because you were insatiable ; yes , you have played the prostitute with them , and yet you weren 't satisfied .
you have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants , to Chaldea ; and yet you weren 't satisfied with this .
in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way , and make your lofty place in every street , and have not been as a prostitute , in that you scorn pay .
they give gifts to all prostitutes ; but you give your gifts to all your lovers , and bribe them , that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution .
I will judge you , as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy .
they shall also bring up a company against you , and they shall stone you with stones , and thrust you through with their swords .
they shall burn your houses with fire , and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute , and you shall also give no hire any more .
behold , everyone who uses Proverbs shall use [ this ] proverb against you , saying , As is the mother , so is her daughter .
your elder sister is Samaria , who dwells at your left hand , she and her daughters ; and your younger sister , who dwells at your right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
yet have you not walked in their ways , nor done after their abominations ; but , as [ if that were ] a very little [ thing ] , you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , Sodom your sister has not done , she nor her daughters , as you have done , you and your daughters .
behold , this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom : pride , fullness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
neither has Samaria committed half of your sins ; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they , and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done .
I will turn again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , and the captivity of your captives in their midst ;
that you may bear your own shame , and may be ashamed because of all that you have done , in that you are a comfort to them .
nevertheless I will remember my Covenant with you in the days of your youth , and I will establish to you an everlasting Covenant .
I will establish my Covenant with you ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh ;
that you may remember , and be confounded , and never open your mouth any more , because of your shame , when I have forgiven you all that you have done , says the Lord Yahweh .
he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it , and carried it to a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of merchants .
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful soil ; he placed it beside many waters ; he set it as a willow tree .
it was planted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
yes , behold , being planted , shall it prosper ? shall it not utterly wither , when the east wind touches it ? it shall wither in the beds where it grew .
and he took of the seed royal , and made a Covenant with him ; he also brought him under an oath , and took away the mighty of the land ;
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping his Covenant it might stand .
for he has despised the oath by breaking the Covenant ; and behold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
what do you mean , that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , you shall not have [ occasion ] any more to use this proverb in Israel .
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul who sins , he shall die .
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has defiled his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her impurity ,
and has not wronged any , but has restored to the debtor his pledge , has taken nothing by robbery , has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
and who does not any of those [ duties ] , but even has eaten on the mountains , and defiled his neighbor 's wife ,
has wronged the poor and needy , has taken by robbery , has not restored the pledge , and has lifted up his eyes to the idols , has committed abomination ,
has given forth on interest , and has taken increase ; shall he then live ? he shall not live : he has done all these abominations ; he shall surely die ; his blood shall be on him .
now , behold , if he fathers a son , who sees all his father 's sins , which he has done , and fears , and does not such like ;
who has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , has not defiled his neighbor 's wife ,
neither has wronged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ordinances , has walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
as for his father , because he cruelly oppressed , robbed his brother , and did that which is not good among his people , behold , he shall die in his iniquity .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
none of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him : in his righteousness that he has done he shall live .
have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked ? says the Lord Yahweh ; and not rather that he should return from his way , and live ?
when the righteous man turns away from his righteousness , and commits iniquity , and dies therein ; in his iniquity that he has done shall he die .
because he considers , and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
cast away from you all your transgressions , in which you have transgressed ; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit : for why will you die , house of Israel ?
she brought up one of her cubs : he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit ; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt .
now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her cubs , and made him a young lion .
he knew their palaces , and laid waste their cities ; and the land was desolate , and its fullness , because of the noise of his roaring .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
they put him in a cage with hooks , and brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into strongholds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
your mother was like a vine , in your blood , planted by the waters : it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
it had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule , and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs , and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches .
in that day I swore to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands .
I said to them , cast away every man the abominations of his eyes , and don 't defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt ; I am Yahweh your God .
so I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
I gave them my statutes , and showed them my ordinances , which if a man does , he shall live in them .
moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies them .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
because they rejected my ordinances , and didn 't walk in my statutes , and profaned my Sabbaths : for their heart went after their idols .
nevertheless my eye spared them , and I didn 't destroy them , neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness .
I said to their children in the wilderness , Don 't walk in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their ordinances , nor defile yourselves with their idols .
I am Yahweh your God : walk in my statutes , and keep my ordinances , and do them ;
and make my Sabbaths holy ; and they shall be a sign between me and you , that you may know that I am Yahweh your God .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
moreover I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ;
because they had not executed my ordinances , but had rejected my statutes , and had profaned my Sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good , and ordinances in which they should not live ;
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
then I said to them , What does the high place where you go mean ? so its name is called Bamah to this day .
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with wrath poured out ;
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face .
like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I enter into judgment with you , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will cause you to pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant ;
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country which I swore to give to your fathers .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your evil ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh .
then I said , Ah Lord Yahweh ! they say of me , Isn 't he a speaker of parables ?
son of man , set your face toward Jerusalem , and drop [ your word ] toward the sanctuaries , and prophesy against the land of Israel ;
and tell the land of Israel , Thus says Yahweh : behold , I am against you , and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath , and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked .
seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
and all flesh shall know that I , Yahweh , have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath ; it shall not return any more .
it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter ; it is furbished that it may be as lightning : shall we then make mirth ? the rod of my son , it condemns every tree .
it is given to be furbished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpened , yes , it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
I have set the threatening sword against all their gates , that their heart may melt , and their stumblings be multiplied : ah ! it is made as lightning , it is pointed for slaughter .
gather yourselves together , go to the right , set yourselves in array , go to the left , wherever your face is set .
I will also strike my hands together , and I will cause my wrath to rest : I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
you shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified .
it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight , who have sworn oaths to them ; but he brings iniquity to memory , that they may be taken .
you , deadly wounded wicked one , the prince of Israel , whose day has come , in the time of the iniquity of the end ,
I will overturn , overturn , overturn it : this also shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it [ him ] .
cause it to return into its sheath . in the place where you were created , in the land of your birth , will I judge you .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men , skillful to destroy .
you shall say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : a city that sheds blood in the midst of her , that her time may come , and that makes idols against herself to defile her !
those who are near , and those who are far from you , shall mock you , you infamous one [ and ] full of tumult .
behold , the princes of Israel , everyone according to his power , have been in you to shed blood .
in you have they set light by father and mother ; in the midst of you have they dealt by oppression with the foreigner ; in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow .
Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood ; and in you they have eaten on the mountains : in the midst of you they have committed lewdness .
in you have they uncovered their fathers ' nakedness ; in you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity .
one has committed abomination with his neighbor 's wife ; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter @-@ in @-@ law ; and another in you has humbled his sister , his father 's daughter .
in you have they taken bribes to shed blood ; you have taken interest and increase , and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by oppression , and have forgotten me , says the Lord Yahweh .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
can your heart endure , or can your hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with you ? I , Yahweh , have spoken it , and will do it .
I will scatter you among the nations , and disperse you through the countries ; and I will consume your filthiness out of you .
you shall be profaned in yourself , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
son of man , the house of Israel has become dross to me : all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are the dross of silver .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have all become dross , therefore , behold , I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem .
yes , I will gather you , and blow on you with the fire of my wrath , and you shall be melted in its midst .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so you will be melted in its midst ; and you will know that I , Yahweh , have poured out my wrath on you .
her princes in its midst are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , [ and ] to destroy souls , that they may get dishonest gain .
her prophets have plastered for them with whitewash , seeing false visions , and divining lies to them , saying , Thus says the Lord Yahweh , when Yahweh has not spoken .
therefore have I poured out my indignation on them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
and they played the prostitute in Egypt ; they played the prostitute in their youth ; there were their breasts pressed , and there was handled the bosom of their virginity .
Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine ; and she doted on her lovers , on the Assyrians [ her ] neighbors ,
she bestowed her prostitution on them , the choicest men of Assyria all of them ; and on whoever she doted , with all their idols she defiled herself .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bosom of her virginity ; and they poured out their prostitution on her .
therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the Assyrians , on whom she doted .
these uncovered her nakedness ; they took her sons and her daughters ; and her they killed with the sword : and she became a byword among women ; for they executed judgments on her .
her sister Oholibah saw this , yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she , and in her prostitution which were more than the prostitution of her sister .
as soon as she saw them she doted on them , and sent messengers to them into Chaldea .
the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their prostitution , and she was polluted with them , and her soul was alienated from them .
so she uncovered her prostitution , and uncovered her nakedness : then my soul was alienated from her , like as my soul was alienated from her sister .
yet she multiplied her prostitution , remembering the days of her youth , in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt .
she doted on their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth , in the handling of your bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of your youth .
therefore , Oholibah , thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will raise up your lovers against you , from whom your soul is alienated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
they shall also strip you of your clothes , and take away your beautiful jewels .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate , into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated ;
you have walked in the way of your sister ; therefore will I give her cup into your hand .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : you will drink of your sister 's cup , which is deep and large ; you will be ridiculed and held in derision ; it contains much .
you shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of your sister Samaria .
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
furthermore you have sent for men who come from far , to whom a messenger was sent , and behold , they came ; for whom you did wash yourself , paint your eyes , and decorate yourself with ornaments ,
and sit on a stately bed , with a table prepared before it , whereupon you set my incense and my oil .
then I said of her who was old in adulteries , Now will they play the prostitute with her , and she [ with them ] .
they went in to her , as they go in to a prostitute : so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah , the lewd women .
Righteous men , they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses , and with the judgment of women who shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will bring up a company against them , and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall kill their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
they shall recompense your lewdness on you , and you shall bear the sins of your idols ; and you shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , write the name of the day , [ even ] of this same day : the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day .
gather its pieces into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it on the bare rock ; she didn 't pour it on the ground , to cover it with dust .
that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , I have set her blood on the bare rock , that it should not be covered .
heap on the wood , make the fire hot , boil well the flesh , and make thick the broth , and let the bones be burned .
then set it empty on its coals , that it may be hot , and its brass may burn , and that its filthiness may be molten in it , that its rust may be consumed .
she has wearied [ herself ] with toil ; yet her great rust doesn 't go forth out of her ; her rust doesn 't [ go forth ] by fire .
in your filthiness is lewdness : because I have cleansed you and you weren 't cleansed , you shall not be cleansed from your filthiness any more , until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest .
son of man , behold , I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke : yet you shall neither mourn nor weep , neither shall your tears run down .
sigh , but not aloud , make no mourning for the dead ; bind your headdress on you , and put your shoes on your feet , and don 't cover your lips , and don 't eat men 's bread .
so I spoke to the people in the morning ; and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
your tires shall be on your heads , and your shoes on your feet : you shall not mourn nor weep ; but you shall pine away in your iniquities , and moan one toward another .
I will make Rabbah a stable for camels , and the children of Ammon a resting place for flocks : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have clapped your hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced with all the despite of your soul against the land of Israel ;
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth Jeshimoth , Baal Meon , and Kiriathaim ,
thus says the Lord Yahweh : because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and has greatly offended , and revenged himself on them ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , behold , I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines , and I will cut off the Cherethites , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast .
I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall lay my vengeance on them .
it happened in the eleventh year , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , behold , I am against you , Tyre , and will cause many nations to come up against you , as the sea causes its waves to come up .
they shall destroy the walls of Tyre , and break down her towers : I will also scrape her dust from her , and make her a bare rock .
she shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh ; and she shall become a spoil to the nations .
her daughters who are in the field shall be slain with the sword : and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
he shall kill your daughters in the field with the sword ; and he shall make forts against you , and cast up a mound against you , and raise up the buckler against you .
he shall set his battering engines against your walls , and with his axes he shall break down your towers .
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the sword ; and the pillars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
I will cause the noise of your songs to cease ; and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard .
I will make you a bare rock ; you shall be a place for the spreading of nets ; you shall be built no more : for I Yahweh have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
now shall the islands tremble in the day of your fall ; yes , the islands that are in the sea shall be dismayed at your departure .
your borders are in the heart of the seas ; your builders have perfected your beauty .
they have made all your planks of fir trees from Senir ; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you .
of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars ; they have made your benches of Ivory inlaid in boxwood , from the islands of Kittim .
of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail , that it might be to you for a banner ; blue and purple from the islands of Elishah was your awning .
the inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers : your wise men , Tyre , were in you , they were your pilots .
Persia and Lud and Put were in your army , your men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in you ; they set forth your comeliness .
the men of Arvad with your army were on your walls all around , and valorous men were in your towers ; they hanged their shields on your walls all around ; they have perfected your beauty .
Javan , Tubal , and Meshech , they were your traffickers ; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for your merchandise .
the men of Dedan were your traffickers ; many islands were the market of your hand : they brought you in exchange horns of Ivory and ebony .
Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of your handiworks : they traded for your wares with emeralds , purple , and embroidered work , and fine linen , and coral , and rubies .
Judah , and the land of Israel , they were your traffickers : they traded for your merchandise wheat of Minnith , and confections , and honey , and oil , and balm .
Arabia , and all the princes of Kedar , they were the merchants of your hand ; in lambs , and rams , and goats , in these were they your merchants .
the traffickers of Sheba and Raamah , they were your traffickers ; they traded for your wares with the chief of all spices , and with all precious stones , and gold .
these were your traffickers in choice wares , in wrappings of blue and embroidered work , and in chests of rich clothing , bound with cords and made of cedar , among your merchandise .
the ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise : and you were replenished , and made very glorious in the heart of the seas .
your rowers have brought you into great waters : the east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas .
at the sound of the cry of your pilots the suburbs shall shake .
all who handled the oar , the mariners , [ and ] all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
and shall cause their voice to be heard over you , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust on their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
and they shall make themselves bald for you , and clothe them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for you in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning .
when your wares went forth out of the seas , you filled many peoples ; you enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise .
in the time that you were broken by the seas in the depths of the waters , your merchandise and all your company fell in your midst .
all the inhabitants of the islands are astonished at you , and their kings are horribly afraid ; they are troubled in their face .
behold , you are wiser than Daniel ; there is no secret that is hidden from you ;
by your wisdom and by your understanding you have gotten yourself riches , and have gotten gold and silver into your treasures ;
by your great wisdom [ and ] by your traffic you have increased your riches , and your heart is lifted up because of your riches--
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall defile your brightness .
they shall bring you down to the pit ; and you shall die the death of those who are slain , in the heart of the seas .
will you yet say before him who kills you , I am God ? but you are man , and not God , in the hand of him who wounds you .
you shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers : for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre , and tell him , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : you seal up the sum , full of wisdom , and perfect in beauty .
you were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created , until unrighteousness was found in you .
for I will send pestilence into her , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her , with the sword on her on every side ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twelfth day of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
" son of man , set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and prophesy against him and against all Egypt .
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and tore all their shoulders ; and when they leaned on you , you broke , and paralyzed all of their thighs . "
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : " behold , I will bring a sword on you , and will cut off man and animal from you .
the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh . because he has said , ' The river is mine , and I have made it ; '
no foot of man shall pass through it , nor foot of animal shall pass through it , neither shall it be inhabited forty years .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : " at the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered ;
and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the base of the kingdoms ; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations : and I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served , because they worked for me , says the Lord Yahweh .
in that day will I cause a Horn to bud forth to the house of Israel , and I will give you the opening of the mouth in their midst ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
for the day is near , even the day of Yahweh is near ; it shall be a day of clouds , a time of the nations .
a sword shall come on Egypt , and anguish shall be in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt ; and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
thus says Yahweh : they also who uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword , says the Lord Yahweh .
they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate ; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and all her helpers are destroyed .
in that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid ; and there shall be anguish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , behold , it comes .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease , by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought in to destroy the land ; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
I will make Pathros desolate , and will set a fire in Zoan , and will execute judgments on No .
I will pour my wrath on sin , the stronghold of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multitude of No .
I will set a fire in Egypt : sin shall be in great anguish , and No shall be broken up ; and Memphis [ shall have ] adversaries in the daytime .
the young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword ; and these [ cities ] shall go into captivity .
thus will I execute judgments on Egypt ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but I will break the arms of Pharaoh , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches , and with a forest @-@ like shade , and of high stature ; and its top was among the thick boughs .
the waters nourished it , the deep made it to grow : its rivers ran all around its plantation ; and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field .
therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field ; and its boughs were multiplied , and its branches became long by reason of many waters , when it shot [ them ] forth .
all the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
thus was it beautiful in its greatness , in the length of its branches ; for its root was by many waters .
I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches , so that all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , envied it .
therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh : because you are exalted in stature , and he has set his top among the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ;
I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations ; he shall surely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his wickedness .
on his ruin all the birds of the sky shall dwell , and all the animals of the field shall be on his branches ;
they also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the midst of the nations .
it happened in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples ; and they shall bring you up in my net .
I will lay your flesh on the mountains , and fill the valleys with your height .
I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim , even to the mountains ; and the watercourses shall be full of you .
when I shall extinguish you , I will cover the heavens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give its light .
all the bright lights of the sky will I make dark over you , and set darkness on your land , says the Lord Yahweh .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : the sword of the king of Babylon shall come on you .
by the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall ; the terrible of the nations are they all : and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt , and all its multitude shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of animals trouble them .
then will I make their waters clear , and cause their rivers to run like oil , says the Lord Yahweh .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste , a land destitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who dwell therein , then shall they know that I am Yahweh .
this is the lamentation with which they shall lament ; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith ; over Egypt , and over all her multitude , shall they lament therewith , says the Lord Yahweh .
it happened also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , to the lower parts of the earth , with those who go down into the pit .
they shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword : she is delivered to the sword ; draw her away and all her multitudes .
Asshur is there and all her company ; her graves are all around her ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword ;
whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit , and her company is around her grave ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Meshech , Tubal , and all their multitude ; their graves are around them ; all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword ; for they caused their terror in the land of the living .
but you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised , and shall lie with those who are slain by the sword .
there is Edom , her kings and all her princes , who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with those who go down to the pit .
Pharaoh shall see them , and shall be comforted over all his multitude , even Pharaoh and all his army , slain by the sword , says the Lord Yahweh .
if , when he sees the sword come on the land , he blow the trumpet , and warn the people ;
then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet , and doesn 't take warning , if the sword come , and take him away , his blood shall be on his own head .
he heard the sound of the trumpet , and didn 't take warning ; his blood shall be on him ; whereas if he had taken warning , he would have delivered his soul .
so you , son of man , I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel ; therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
nevertheless , if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it , and he doesn 't turn from his way ; he shall die in his iniquity , but you have delivered your soul .
again , when I say to the wicked , You shall surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
none of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him : he has done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
yet the children of your people say , The way of the Lord is not equal : but as for them , their way is not equal .
you stand on your sword , you work abomination , and every one of you defiles his neighbor 's wife : and shall you possess the land ?
I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment ; and the pride of her power shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , so that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am Yahweh , when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment , because of all their abominations which they have committed .
when this comes to pass , ( behold , it comes ) , then shall they know that a prophet has been among them .
you eat the fat , and you clothe yourself with the wool , you kill the fatlings ; but you don 't feed the sheep .
they were scattered , because there was no shepherd ; and they became food to all the animals of the field , and were scattered .
my sheep wandered through all the mountains , and on every high hill : yes , my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth ; and there was none who searched or sought .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I myself , even I , will search for my sheep , and will seek them out .
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep , and I will cause them to lie down , says the Lord Yahweh .
as for my sheep , they eat that which you have trodden with your feet , and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh to them : behold , I , even I , will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep .
because you thrust with side and with shoulder , and push all the diseased with your horns , until you have scattered them abroad ;
therefore will I save my flock , and they shall no more be a prey ; and I will judge between sheep and sheep .
I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
I will make with them a Covenant of peace , and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land ; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
they shall no more be a prey to the nations , neither shall the animals of the earth devour them ; but they shall dwell securely , and none shall make them afraid .
I will raise up to them a plantation for renown , and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land , neither bear the shame of the nations any more .
they shall know that I , Yahweh , their God am with them , and that they , the house of Israel , are my people , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will lay your cities waste , and you shall be desolate ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because you have had a perpetual enmity , and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time of the iniquity of the end ;
therefore , as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , I will prepare you for blood , and blood shall pursue you : since you have not hated blood , therefore blood shall pursue you .
thus will I make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation ; and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns .
I will fill its mountains with its slain : in your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses shall they fall who are slain with the sword .
I will make you a perpetual desolation , and your cities shall not be inhabited ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
you have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard it .
you , son of man , prophesy to the mountains of Israel , and say , You mountains of Israel , hear the word of Yahweh .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : I have sworn , [ saying ] , surely the nations that are around you , they shall bear their shame .
for , behold , I am for you , and I will turn into you , and you shall be tilled and sown ;
and I will multiply men on you , all the house of Israel , even all of it ; and the cities shall be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built ;
neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations , neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , they defiled it by their way and by their doings : their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity .
therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land , and because they had defiled it with their idols ;
and I scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
when they came to the nations , where they went , they profaned my holy name ; in that men said of them , These are the people of Yahweh , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had respect for my holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations , where they went .
for I will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
I will also give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you a heart of flesh .
I will put my Spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and you shall keep my ordinances , and do them .
you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers ; and you shall be my people , and I will be your God .
I will save you from all your uncleanness : and I will call for the grain , and will multiply it , and lay no famine on you .
I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that you may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations .
then you shall remember your evil ways , and your doings that were not good ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities , I will cause the cities to be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built .
the land that was desolate shall be tilled , whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed by .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts , so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh , and set me down in the midst of the valley ; and it was full of bones .
he caused me to pass by them all around : and behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and behold , they were very dry .
he said to me , Son of man , can these bones live ? I answered , Lord Yahweh , you know .
thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones : behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and you shall live .
I will lay sinews on you , and will bring up flesh on you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and you shall live ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
so I prophesied as I was commanded : and as I prophesied , there was a noise , and behold , an earthquake ; and the bones came together , bone to its bone .
I saw , and , behold , there were sinews on them , and flesh came up , and skin covered them above ; but there was no breath in them .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
I will put my Spirit in you , and you shall live , and I will place you in your own land : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it and performed it , says Yahweh .
the sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes .
my servant David shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one shepherd : they shall also walk in my ordinances , and observe my statutes , and do them .
my tent also shall be with them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
son of man , set your face toward Gog , of the land of Magog , the prince of Rosh , Meshech , and Tubal , and prophesy against him ,
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against you , Gog , prince of Rosh , Meshech , and Tubal :
Gomer , and all his hordes ; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north , and all his hordes ; even many peoples with you .
be prepared , yes , prepare yourself , you , and all your companies who are assembled to you , and be a guard to them .
you shall ascend , you shall come like a storm , you shall be like a cloud to cover the land , you , and all your hordes , and many peoples with you .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : it shall happen in that day , that things shall come into your mind , and you shall devise an evil device :
it shall happen in that day , when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains , says the Lord Yahweh : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
I will magnify myself , and sanctify myself , and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
you , son of man , prophesy against Gog , and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against you , Gog , prince of Rosh , Meshech , and Tubal :
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
and I will strike your bow out of your left hand , and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand .
behold , it comes , and it shall be done , says the Lord Yahweh ; this is the day about which I have spoken .
yes , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified , says the Lord Yahweh .
those who pass through the land shall pass through ; and when any sees a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , until the undertakers have buried it in the valley of Hamon Gog .
you shall eat fat until you be full , and drink blood until you are drunk , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
you shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will set my glory among the nations ; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid on them .
so the house of Israel shall know that I am Yahweh their God , from that day and forward .
according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I to them ; and I hid my face from them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob , and have mercy on the whole house of Israel ; and I will be Jealous for my holy name .
they shall bear their shame , and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me , when they shall dwell securely in their land , and none shall make them afraid ;
when I have brought them back from the peoples , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations .
neither will I hide my face any more from them ; for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh .
he brought me there ; and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring Reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he measured the threshold of the gate , one Reed broad ; and the other threshold , one Reed broad .
every lodge was one Reed long , and one Reed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lodges was five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one Reed .
he measured also the porch of the gate toward the house , one Reed .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and its posts , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was toward the house .
he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate , ten cubits ; and the length of the gate , thirteen cubits ;
and a border before the lodges , one cubit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cubit on that side ; and the lodges , six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other , a breadth of twenty @-@ five cubits ; door against door .
he made also posts , sixty cubits ; and the court [ reached ] to the posts , around the gate .
[ from ] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits .
then brought he me into the outer court ; and behold , there were rooms and a pavement , made for the court all around : thirty rooms were on the pavement .
the pavement was by the side of the gates , answerable to the length of the gates , even the lower pavement .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside , one hundred cubits , [ both ] on the east and on the north .
the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north , he measured its length and its breadth .
the lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate : its length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty @-@ five cubits .
there was a gate to the inner court over against the [ other ] gate , [ both ] on the north and on the east ; and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits .
there were windows in it and in its arches all around , like those windows : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty @-@ five cubits .
then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate : and he measured the south gate according to these measures ;
and its lodges , and its posts , and its arches , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in its arches all around ; it was fifty cubits long , and twenty @-@ five cubits broad .
he brought me into the inner court toward the east : and he measured the gate according to these measures ;
and its lodges , and its posts , and its arches , according to these measures : and there were windows therein and in its arches all around ; it was fifty cubits long , and twenty @-@ five cubits broad .
the arches of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to kill thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they killed [ the sacrifices ] .
he measured the court , one hundred cubits long , and a hundred cubits broad , foursquare ; and the altar was before the house .
he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tent .
he measured its length , twenty cubits , and the breadth , twenty cubits , before the temple : and he said to me , This is the most holy place .
then he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side room , four cubits , all around the house on every side .
I saw also that the house had a raised base all around : the foundations of the side rooms were a full Reed of six great cubits .
the thickness of the wall , which was for the side rooms , on the outside , was five cubits : and that which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits all around .
the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around , and its length ninety cubits .
so he measured the house , one hundred cubits long ; and the separate place , and the building , with its walls , one hundred cubits long ;
also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , one hundred cubits .
from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made : thus was the wall of the temple .
as for the temple , the door posts were squared ; and as for the face of the sanctuary , the appearance [ of it ] was as the appearance [ of the temple ] .
the doors had two leaves [ apiece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
before the length of one hundred cubits was the north door , and the breadth was fifty cubits .
before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits ' breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and their doors were toward the north .
now the upper rooms were shorter ; for the galleries took away from these , more than from the lower and the middle , in the building .
for they were in three stories , and they didn 't have pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore [ the uppermost ] was straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground .
the wall that was outside by the side of the rooms , toward the outer court before the rooms , its length was fifty cubits .
for the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits : and behold , before the temple were one hundred cubits .
in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , before the separate place , and before the building , there were rooms .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it all around .
he measured on the east side with the measuring Reed five hundred reeds , with the measuring Reed all around .
he measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring Reed all around .
he turned about to the west side , and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring Reed .
afterward he brought me to the gate , even the gate that looks toward the east .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the earth shined with his glory .
the glory of Yahweh came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
the Spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house .
I heard one speaking to me out of the house ; and a man stood by me .
now let them put away their prostitution , and the dead bodies of their kings , far from me ; and I will dwell in their midst forever .
this is the law of the house : on the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy . behold , this is the law of the house .
from the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits , and the breadth one cubit ; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits , and the breadth a cubit .
you shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yahweh , a young bull for a sin offering .
you shall also take the bull of the sin offering , and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house , outside of the sanctuary .
on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering ; and they shall cleanse the altar , as they cleansed it with the bull .
when you have finished cleansing it , you shall offer a young bull without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
you shall bring them near to Yahweh , and the priests shall cast salt on them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering : they shall also prepare a young bull , and a ram out of the flock , without blemish .
seven days shall they make Atonement for the altar and purify it ; so shall they consecrate it .
then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary , which looks toward the east ; and it was shut .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh : and I fell on my face .
you have not performed the duty of my holy things ; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves .
thus says the Lord Yahweh , No foreigner , uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my sanctuary , of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel .
but the Levites who went far from me , when Israel went astray , who went astray from me after their idols , they shall bear their iniquity .
yet will I make them performers of the duty of the house , for all its service , and for all that shall be done therein .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister to me , and they shall keep my instruction .
they shall have linen tires on their heads , and shall have linen breeches on their waists ; they shall not clothe themselves with [ anything that causes ] sweat .
neither shall they shave their heads , nor allow their locks to grow long ; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads .
neither shall any of the priests drink wine , when they enter into the inner court .
they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
in a controversy they shall stand to judge ; according to my ordinances shall they judge it : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts ; and they shall make my Sabbaths holy .
after he is cleansed , they shall reckon to him seven days .
in the day that he goes into the sanctuary , into the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer his sin offering , says the Lord Yahweh .
they shall have an inheritance : I am their inheritance ; and you shall give them no possession in Israel ; I am their possession .
they shall eat the meal offering , and the sin offering , and the trespass offering ; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs .
of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred [ in length ] by five hundred [ in breadth ] , square all around ; and fifty cubits for its suburbs all around .
of this measure you shall measure a length of twenty @-@ five thousand , and a breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary , which is most holy .
in the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel : and my princes shall no more oppress my people ; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of a Homer : its measure shall be after the Homer .
this is the offering that you shall offer : the sixth part of an ephah from a Homer of wheat ; and you shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a Homer of barley ;
all the people of the land shall give to this offering for the prince in Israel .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bull without blemish ; and you shall cleanse the sanctuary .
so you shall do on the seventh [ day ] of the month for everyone who errs , and for him who is simple : so you shall make Atonement for the house .
in the first [ month ] , in the fourteenth day of the month , you shall have the Passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
on that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering .
the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to Yahweh , seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days ; and a male goat daily for a sin offering .
he shall prepare a meal offering , an ephah for a bull , and an ephah for a ram , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons .
the burnt offering that the prince shall offer to Yahweh shall be on the Sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish ;
and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram , and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram ; they shall be without blemish :
and he shall prepare a meal offering , an ephah for the bull , and an ephah for the ram , and for the lambs according as he is able , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate , and he shall go forth by its way .
the prince , when they go in , shall go in with of them ; and when they go out , he shall go out .
you shall prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to Yahweh daily : morning by morning you shall prepare it .
thus shall they prepare the lamb , and the meal offering , and the oil , morning by morning , for a continual burnt offering .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : if the prince give a gift to any of his sons , it is his inheritance , it shall belong to his sons ; it is their possession by inheritance .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part westward .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
in the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed , forty [ cubits ] long and thirty broad : these four in the corners were of one measure .
there was a wall around in them , around the four , and boiling places were made under the walls all around .
then he said to me , These are the boiling houses , where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people .
when the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand , he measured one thousand cubits , and he caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the ankles .
afterward he measured one thousand ; [ and it was ] a river that I could not pass through ; for the waters were risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed through .
he said to me , Son of man , have you seen [ this ] ? then he brought me , and caused me to return to the bank of the river .
now when I had returned , behold , on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
but the miry places of it , and its marshes , shall not be healed ; they shall be given up to salt .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : this shall be the border , by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel : Joseph [ shall have two ] portions .
you shall inherit it , one as well as another ; for I swore to give it to your fathers : and this land shall fall to you for inheritance .
this shall be the border of the land : on the north side , from the great sea , by the way of Hethlon , to the entrance of Zedad ;
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazer Hatticon , which is by the border of Hauran .
the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh , to the Brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea . this is the south side southward .
the west side shall be the great sea , from the [ south ] border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath . this is the west side .
by the border of Asher , from the east side even to the west side , Naphtali , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Naphtali , from the east side to the west side , Manasseh , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Manasseh , from the east side to the west side , Ephraim , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Ephraim , from the east side even to the west side , Reuben , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Reuben , from the east side to the west side , Judah , one [ portion ] .
the offering that you shall offer to Yahweh shall be twenty @-@ five thousand [ reeds ] in length , and ten thousand in breadth .
[ it shall be ] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok , who have kept my instruction , who didn 't go astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
it shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land , a thing most holy , by the border of the Levites .
those who labor in the city , out of all the tribes of Israel , shall cultivate it .
by the border of Benjamin , from the east side to the west side , Simeon , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Simeon , from the east side to the west side , Issachar , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Issachar , from the east side to the west side , Zebulun , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Zebulun , from the east side to the west side , Gad , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Gad , at the south side southward , the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh , to the Brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea .
this is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their several portions , says the Lord Yahweh .
at the east side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , and three gates : even the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Issachar , one ; the gate of Zebulun , one .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , with their three gates : the gate of Gad , one ; the gate of Asher , one ; the gate of Naphtali , one .
in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem , and besieged it .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's dainties , and of the wine which he drank , and that they should be nourished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
now among these were , of the children of Judah , Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs .
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the youths who eat of the king 's dainties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
at the end of ten days their faces appeared fairer , and they were fatter in flesh , than all the youths who ate of the king 's dainties .
now as for these four youths , God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom : and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in , the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
the king talked with them ; and among them all was found none like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah : therefore stood they before the king .
in every matter of wisdom and understanding , concerning which the king inquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm .
in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sleep went from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the enchanters , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , to tell the king his dreams . so they came in and stood before the king .
the king answered the Chaldeans , The thing is gone from me : if you don 't make known to me the dream and its interpretation , you shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
the king answered , I know of a certainty that you would gain time , because you see the thing is gone from me .
it is a rare thing that the king requires , and there is no other who can show it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
so the decree went forth , and the wise men were to be slain ; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain .
then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king 's guard , who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon ;
he answered Arioch the king 's captain , Why is the decree so urgent from the king ? then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel .
Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpretation .
then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , his companions :
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night . then Daniel blessed the God of heaven .
he changes the times and the seasons ; he removes kings , and sets up kings ; he gives wisdom to the wise , and knowledge to those who have understanding ;
he reveals the deep and secret things ; he knows what is in the darkness , and the light dwells with him .
Daniel answered before the king , and said , The secret which the king has demanded can neither wise men , enchanters , magicians , nor soothsayers , show to the king ;
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
you , O king , saw , and behold , a great image . this image , which was mighty , and whose brightness was excellent , stood before you ; and its aspect was awesome .
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its breast and its arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of brass ,
you saw until a stone was cut out without hands , which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay , and broke them in pieces .
you , O king , are king of kings , to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom , the power , and the strength , and the glory ;
and wherever the children of men dwell , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron , because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things ; and as iron that crushes all these , shall it break in pieces and crush .
then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face , and worshiped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him .
the king answered to Daniel , and said , Of a truth your God is the God of gods , and the Lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , since you have been able to reveal this secret .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon .
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold , whose height was sixty cubits , and its breadth six cubits : he set it up in the plain of Dura , in the province of Babylon .
and whoever doesn 't fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near , and brought accusation against the Jews .
then Nebuchadnezzar in [ his ] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . then they brought these men before the king .
Nebuchadnezzar answered them , Is it on purpose , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , that you don 't serve my god , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
but if not , be it known to you , O king , that we will not serve your gods , nor worship the golden image which you have set up .
he commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , [ and ] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
then these men were bound in their pants , their tunics , and their mantles , and their [ other ] garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
therefore because the king 's commandment was urgent , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego .
these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then the king promoted Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego in the province of Babylon .
Nebuchadnezzar the king , to all the peoples , nations , and languages , who dwell in all the earth : peace be multiplied to you .
it has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked toward me .
how great are his signs ! and how mighty are his wonders ! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is from generation to generation .
I saw a dream which made me afraid ; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpretation .
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth ; and its height was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and its height reached to the sky , and its sight to the end of all the earth .
I saw in the visions of my head on my bed , and behold , a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky .
let his heart be changed from man 's , and let an animal 's heart be given to him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that you saw , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached to the sky , and its sight to all the earth ;
it is you , O king , that are grown and become strong ; for your greatness is grown , and reaches to the sky , and your dominion to the end of the earth .
this is the interpretation , O king , and it is the decree of the Most High , which has come on my lord the king :
whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree ; your kingdom shall be sure to you , after that you shall have known that the heavens do rule .
at the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon .
the king spoke and said , Is not this great Babylon , which I have built for the royal dwelling place , by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : the kingdom has departed from you :
Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords , and drank wine before the thousand .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God 's house which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , drank from them .
they drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour came forth the fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his thoughts troubled him ; and the joints of his thighs were loosened , and his knees struck one against another .
then came in all the king 's wise men ; but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation .
I have heard of you , that the spirit of the gods is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
you , king , the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and majesty :
then was the part of the hand sent from before him , and this writing was inscribed .
Peres ; your kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians .
then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with purple , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps , who should be throughout the whole kingdom ;
and over them three presidents , of whom Daniel was one ; that these satraps might give account to them , and that the king should have no damage .
then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
then these men said , We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel , except we find it against him concerning the law of his God .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it not be changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which doesn 't alter .
then the king , when he heard these words , was very displeased , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him .
then these men assembled together to the king , and said to the king , Know , O king , that it is a law of the Medes and Persians , that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Your God whom you serve continually , he will deliver you .
a stone was brought , and laid on the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sleep fled from him .
then the king arose very early in the morning , and went in haste to the den of lions .
in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed : then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters .
four great animals came up from the sea , diverse one from another .
after this I saw , and behold , another , like a Leopard , which had on its back four wings of a bird ; the animal had also four heads ; and dominion was given to it .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousands of thousands ministered to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the Horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was slain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
as for the rest of the animals , their dominion was taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time .
I saw in the night visions , and behold , there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man , and he came even to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
as for me , Daniel , my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near to one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth concerning all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
these great animals , which are four , are four kings , who shall arise out of the earth .
I saw , and the same Horn made war with the saints , and prevailed against them ;
until the ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High , and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
as for the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
but the judgment shall be set , and they shall take away his dominion , to consume and to destroy it to the end .
here is the end of the matter . as for me , Daniel , my thoughts much troubled me , and my face was changed in me : but I kept the matter in my heart .
in the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me , even to me , Daniel , after that which appeared to me at the first .
as I was considering , behold , a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth , and didn 't touch the ground : and the goat had a notable Horn between his eyes .
he came to the ram that had the two horns , which I saw standing before the river , and ran on him in the fury of his power .
the male goat magnified himself exceedingly : and when he was strong , the great Horn was broken ; and instead of it there came up four notable [ horns ] toward the four winds of the sky .
out of one of them came forth a little Horn , which grew exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the glorious [ land ] .
it grew great , even to the army of the sky ; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the ground , and trampled on them .
yes , it magnified itself , even to the prince of the army ; and it took away from him the continual [ burnt offering ] , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
the army was given over [ to it ] together with the continual [ burnt offering ] through disobedience ; and it cast down truth to the ground , and it did [ its pleasure ] and prospered .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
I heard a man 's voice between [ the banks of ] the Ulai , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
now as he was speaking with me , I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground ; but he touched me , and set me upright .
the ram which you saw , that had the two horns , they are the kings of Media and Persia .
the rough male goat is the king of Greece : and the great Horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
in the latter time of their kingdom , when the transgressors have come to the full , a king of fierce face , and understanding dark sentences , shall stand up .
his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper and do [ his pleasure ] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
the vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true : but seal up the vision ; for it belongs to many days [ to come ] .
we have sinned , and have dealt perversely , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances ;
neither have we listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
Lord , to us belongs confusion of face , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers , because we have sinned against you .
neither have we obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil , and brought it on us ; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does , and we have not obeyed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
now therefore , our God , listen to the prayer of your servant , and to his petitions , and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord 's sake .
yes , while I was speaking in prayer , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
he instructed me , and talked with me , and said , Daniel , I am now come forth to give you wisdom and understanding .
I ate no pleasant bread , neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth , neither did I anoint myself at all , until three whole weeks were fulfilled .
in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is Hiddekel ,
I lifted up my eyes , and looked , and behold , a man clothed in linen , whose thighs were adorned with pure gold of Uphaz :
I , Daniel , alone saw the vision ; for the men who were with me didn 't see the vision ; but a great quaking fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
behold , a hand touched me , which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty @-@ one days ; but , behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days ; for the vision is yet for [ many ] days :
and when he had spoken to me according to these words , I set my face toward the ground , and was mute .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there breath left in me .
then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthened me .
then he said , " Do you know why I have come to you ? now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia . when I go forth , behold , the prince of Greece shall come .
but I will tell you that which is inscribed in the writing of truth : and there is none who holds with me against these , but Michael your prince . "
" as for me , in the first year of Darius the Mede , I stood up to confirm and strengthen him .
a mighty king shall stand up , who shall rule with great dominion , and do according to his will .
the king of the south shall be strong , and [ one ] of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
he shall come into the realm of the king of the south , but he shall return into his own land .
his sons shall war , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces , which shall come on , and overflow , and pass through ; and they shall return and war , even to his fortress .
the multitude shall be lifted up , and his heart shall be exalted ; and he shall cast down tens of thousands , but he shall not prevail .
after this shall he turn his face to the islands , and shall take many : but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ; yes , moreover , he shall cause his reproach to turn on him .
then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land ; but he shall stumble and fall , and shall not be found .
in his place shall stand up a contemptible person , to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom : but he shall come in time of security , and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him , and shall be broken ; yes , also the prince of the Covenant .
after the treaty made with him he shall work deceitfully ; for he shall come up , and shall become strong , with a small people .
yes , they who eat of his dainties shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow ; and many shall fall down slain .
as for both these kings , their hearts shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table : but it shall not prosper ; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy Covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come into the south ; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall profane the sanctuary , even the fortress , and shall take away the continual [ burnt offering ] , and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate .
such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he pervert by flatteries ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and do [ exploits ] .
those who are wise among the people shall instruct many ; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame , by captivity and by spoil , [ many ] days .
now when they shall fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall join themselves to them with flatteries .
neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god ; for he shall magnify himself above all .
but in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses ; and a god whom his fathers didn 't know shall he honor with gold , and silver , and with precious stones , and pleasant things .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many [ countries ] shall be overthrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
he shall stretch forth his hand also on the countries ; and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt ; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
but news out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him ; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many .
he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
those who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse ; and those who turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever .
but you , Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run back and forth , and knowledge shall be increased . "
then I , Daniel , looked , and behold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
many shall purify themselves , and make themselves white , and be refined ; but the wicked shall do wickedly ; and none of the wicked shall understand ; but those who are wise shall understand .
from the time that the continual burnt offering shall be taken away , and the abomination that makes desolate set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days .
blessed is he who waits , and comes to the one thousand three hundred thirty @-@ five days .
Yahweh said to him , " Call his name Jezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu , and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease .
it will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel . "
but I will have mercy on the house of Judah , and will save them by Yahweh their God , and will not save them by bow , sword , battle , horses , or horsemen . "
contend with your mother ! contend , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband ; and let her put away her prostitution from her face , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
Lest I strip her naked , and make her bare as in the day that she was born , and make her like a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and kill her with thirst .
indeed , on her children I will have no mercy ; for they are children of unfaithfulness ;
therefore behold , I will hedge up your way with thorns , and I will build a wall against her , that she can 't find her way .
for she did not know that I gave her the grain , the new wine , and the oil , and multiplied to her silver and gold , which they used for Baal .
therefore I will take back my grain in its time , and my new wine in its season , and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness .
now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers , and no one will deliver her out of my hand .
I will also cause all her celebrations to cease : her feasts , her new moons , her Sabbaths , and all her solemn assemblies .
" therefore behold , I will allure her , and bring her into the wilderness , and speak tenderly to her .
for I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth , and they will no longer be mentioned by name .
I will betroth you to me forever . yes , I will betroth you to me in righteousness , in justice , in loving kindness , and in compassion .
I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness ; and you shall know Yahweh .
it will happen in that day , I will respond , " says Yahweh , " I will respond to the heavens , and they will respond to the earth ;
and the earth will respond to the grain , and the new wine , and the oil ; and they will respond to Jezreel .
I said to her , " You shall stay with me many days . you shall not play the prostitute , and you shall not be with any other man . I will also be so toward you . "
for the children of Israel shall live many days without king , and without prince , and without sacrifice , and without sacred stone , and without ephod or idols .
afterward the children of Israel shall return , and seek Yahweh their God , and David their king , and shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days .
hear the word of Yahweh , you children of Israel ; for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land : " indeed there is no truth , nor Goodness , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore the land will mourn , and everyone who dwells therein will waste away. all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
" yet let no man bring a charge , neither let any man accuse ; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest .
you will stumble in the day , and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night ; and I will destroy your mother .
it will be , like people , like priest ; and I will punish them for their ways , and will repay them for their deeds .
they will eat , and not have enough . they will play the prostitute , and will not increase ; because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh .
my people consult with their wooden idol , and answer to a stick of wood . indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray , and they have been unfaithful to their God .
for Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly , like a stubborn heifer . then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a Meadow .
their drink has become sour . they play the prostitute continually . her rulers dearly love their shameful way .
the wind has wrapped her up in its wings ; and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices .
their deeds won 't allow them to turn to their God ; for the spirit of prostitution is within them , and they don 't know Yahweh .
the pride of Israel testifies to his face . therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity . Judah also will stumble with them .
they will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh ; but they won 't find him . he has withdrawn himself from them .
" blow the cornet in Gibeah , and the trumpet in Ramah ! sound a battle cry at Beth Aven , behind you , Benjamin !
Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke . among the tribes of Israel , I have made known that which will surely be .
the princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark . I will pour out my wrath on them like water .
I will go and return to my place , until they acknowledge their offense , and seek my face . in their affliction they will seek me earnestly . "
" come , and let us return to Yahweh ; for he has torn us to pieces , and he will heal us ; he has injured us , and he will bind up our wounds .
after two days he will revive us . on the third day he will raise us up , and we will live before him .
let us acknowledge Yahweh . let us press on to know Yahweh . as surely as the sun rises , Yahweh will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the earth . "
therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets ; I killed them with the words of my mouth . your judgments are like a flash of lightning .
Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity ; it is stained with blood .
as gangs of robbers wait to ambush a man , so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem , committing shameful crimes .
in the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing . there is prostitution in Ephraim . Israel is defiled .
when I would heal Israel , then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered , also the wickedness of Samaria ; for they commit falsehood , and the thief enters in , and the gang of robbers ravages outside .
they don 't consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness . now their own deeds have engulfed them . they are before my face .
they make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
they are all adulterers . they are burning like an oven that the Baker stops stirring , from the kneading of the dough , until it is leavened .
on the day of our king , the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine . he joined his hand with mockers .
for they have prepared their heart like an oven , while they lie in wait . their Baker sleeps all the night . in the morning it burns as a flaming fire .
they are all hot as an oven , and devour their judges . all their kings have fallen . there is no one among them who calls to me .
Ephraim , he mixes himself among the nations . Ephraim is a pancake not turned over .
Strangers have devoured his strength , and he doesn 't realize it . indeed , gray hairs are here and there on him , and he doesn 't realize it .
the pride of Israel testifies to his face ; yet they haven 't returned to Yahweh their God , nor sought him , for all this .
when they go , I will spread my net on them . I will bring them down like the birds of the sky . I will chastise them , as their Congregation has heard .
Woe to them ! for they have wandered from me . destruction to them ! for they have trespassed against me . though I would redeem them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
they haven 't cried to me with their heart , but they howl on their beds . they assemble themselves for grain and new wine . they turn away from me .
" put the trumpet to your lips ! something like an eagle is over Yahweh 's house , because they have broken my Covenant , and rebelled against my law .
Israel has cast off that which is good . the enemy will pursue him .
let Samaria throw out his calf idol ! my anger burns against them ! how long will it be until they are capable of purity ?
for this is even from Israel ! the workman made it , and it is no God ; indeed , the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces .
for they sow the wind , and they will reap the whirlwind . he has no standing grain . the stalk will yield no head . if it does yield , strangers will swallow it up .
for they have gone up to Assyria , like a wild donkey wandering alone . Ephraim has hired lovers for himself .
but although they sold themselves among the nations , I will now gather them ; and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones .
I wrote for him the many things of my law ; but they were regarded as a strange thing .
Don 't rejoice , Israel , to jubilation like the nations ; for you were unfaithful to your God . you love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor .
they won 't dwell in Yahweh 's land ; but Ephraim will return to Egypt , and they will eat unclean food in Assyria .
what will you do in the day of solemn assembly , and in the day of the feast of Yahweh ?
a prophet watches over Ephraim with my God . a fowler 's snare is on all of his paths , and hostility in the house of his God .
they have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of Gibeah . he will remember their iniquity . he will punish them for their sins .
as for Ephraim , their glory will fly away like a bird . there will be no birth , none with child , and no conception .
though they bring up their children , yet I will bereave them , so that not a man shall be left . indeed , woe also to them when I depart from them !
" all their wickedness is in Gilgal ; for there I hated them . because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their princes are rebels .
Ephraim is struck . their root has dried up . they will bear no fruit . even though they bring forth , yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb . "
my God will cast them away , because they did not listen to him ; and they will be wanderers among the nations .
Israel is a luxuriant vine that puts forth his fruit . according to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars . as their land has prospered , they have adorned their sacred stones .
their heart is divided . now they will be found guilty . he will demolish their altars . he will destroy their sacred stones .
it also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king . Ephraim will receive shame , and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel .
when it is my desire , I will chastise them ; and the nations will be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two transgressions .
sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap according to kindness . break up your fallow ground ; for it is time to seek Yahweh , until he comes and rains righteousness on you .
you have plowed wickedness . you have reaped iniquity . you have eaten the fruit of lies , for you trusted in your way , in the multitude of your mighty men .
therefore a battle roar will arise among your people , and all your fortresses will be destroyed , as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle . the mother was dashed in pieces with her children .
" when Israel was a child , then I loved him , and called my son out of Egypt .
they called to them , so they went from them . they sacrificed to the Baals , and burned incense to engraved images .
yet I taught Ephraim to walk . I took them by his arms ; but they didn 't know that I healed them .
I drew them with cords of a man , with ties of love ; and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks ; and I bent down to him and I fed him .
" they won 't return into the land of Egypt ; but the Assyrian will be their king , because they refused to repent .
the sword will fall on their cities , and will destroy the bars of their gates , and will put an end to their plans .
my people are determined to turn from me . though they call to the Most High , he certainly won 't exalt them .
I will not execute the fierceness of my anger . I will not return to destroy Ephraim : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the midst of you ; and I will not come in wrath .
they will walk after Yahweh , who will roar like a lion ; for he will roar , and the children will come trembling from the west .
they will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a dove out of the land of Assyria ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Yahweh .
Ephraim feeds on wind , and chases the east wind . he continually multiplies lies and desolation . they make a Covenant with Assyria , and oil is carried into Egypt .
Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah , and will punish Jacob according to his ways ; according to his deeds he will repay him .
in the womb he took his brother by the heel ; and in his manhood he contended with God .
" but I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt . I will yet again make you dwell in tents , as in the days of the solemn feast .
I have also spoken to the prophets , and I have multiplied visions ; and by the ministry of the prophets I have used parables .
Jacob fled into the country of Aram , and Israel served to get a wife , and for a wife he tended flocks and herds .
when Ephraim spoke , there was trembling . he exalted himself in Israel , but when he became guilty in Baal , he died .
therefore they will be like the morning mist , and like the dew that passes away early , like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor , and like the smoke out of the chimney .
" yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt ; and you shall acknowledge no god but me , and besides me there is no Savior .
according to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was exalted . therefore they have forgotten me .
I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs , and will tear the covering of their heart . there I will devour them like a lioness . the wild animal will tear them .
where is your king now , that he may save you in all your cities ? and your judges , of whom you said , ' Give me a king and princes ? '
I have given you a king in my anger , and have taken him away in my wrath .
the guilt of Ephraim is stored up . his sin is stored up .
the sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him . he is an unwise son ; for when it is time , he doesn 't come to the opening of the womb .
I will ransom them from the power of Sheol . I will redeem them from death ! death , where are your plagues ? Sheol , where is your destruction ? " compassion will be hidden from my eyes .
Samaria will bear her guilt ; for she has rebelled against her God . they will fall by the sword . their infants will be dashed in pieces , and their pregnant women will be ripped open . "
" I will heal their waywardness . I will love them freely ; for my anger is turned away from him .
I will be like the dew to Israel . he will blossom like the Lily , and send down his roots like Lebanon .
his branches will spread , and his beauty will be like the olive tree , and his fragrance like Lebanon .
men will dwell in his shade . they will revive like the grain , and blossom like the vine . their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon .
Ephraim , what have I to do any more with idols ? I answer , and will take care of him . I am like a green fir tree ; from me your fruit is found . "
the Word of Yahweh that came to Joel , the son of Pethuel .
hear this , you elders , And listen , all you inhabitants of the land . has this ever happened in your days , or in the days of your fathers ?
wake up , you drunkards , and weep ! Wail , all you drinkers of wine , because of the sweet wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
for a nation has come up on my land , strong , and without number . his teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he has the fangs of a lioness .
he has laid my vine waste , and stripped my fig tree . he has stripped its bark , and thrown it away . its branches are made white .
the meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from Yahweh 's house . the priests , Yahweh 's ministers , mourn .
the field is laid waste . the land mourns , for the grain is destroyed , The new wine has dried up , and the oil languishes .
Sanctify a fast . call a solemn assembly . gather the elders , and all the inhabitants of the land , to the house of Yahweh , your God , and cry to Yahweh .
the seeds rot under their clods . the granaries are laid desolate . the barns are broken down , for the grain has withered .
how the animals groan ! the herds of livestock are perplexed , because they have no pasture . yes , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
Yahweh , I cry to you , For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame has burned all the trees of the field .
yes , the animals of the field pant to you , for the water brooks have dried up , And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
blow the trumpet in Zion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain ! let all the inhabitants of the land tremble , for the day of Yahweh comes , for it is close at hand :
a fire devours before them , and behind them , a flame burns . the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them , a desolate wilderness . yes , and no one has escaped them .
their appearance is as the appearance of horses , and as horsemen , so do they run .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
they run like mighty men . they climb the wall like warriors . they each march in his line , and they don 't swerve off course .
neither does one jostle another ; they march everyone in his path , and they burst through the defenses , and don 't break ranks .
they rush on the city . they run on the wall . they climb up into the houses . they enter in at the windows like thieves .
the earth quakes before them . the heavens tremble . the sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
Yahweh thunders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obeys his command ; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome , and who can endure it ?
who knows ? he may turn and relent , and leave a blessing behind him , even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh , your God .
gather the people . Sanctify the assembly . assemble the elders . gather the children , and those who nurse from breasts . let the bridegroom go forth from his room , and the bride out of her room .
then Yahweh was Jealous for his land , And had pity on his people .
Yahweh answered his people , " behold , I will send you grain , new wine , and oil , and you will be satisfied with them ; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations .
the threshing floors will be full of wheat , and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil .
I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten , the great locust , the grasshopper , and the caterpillar , my great army , which I sent among you .
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Yahweh , your God , who has dealt wondrously with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
you will know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am Yahweh , your God , and there is no one else ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
and also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days , I will pour out my Spirit .
I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth : blood , fire , and pillars of smoke .
the sun will be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes .
" for , behold , in those days , and in that time , when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem ,
and have cast lots for my people , and have given a boy for a prostitute , and sold a girl for wine , that they may drink .
because you have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried my finest treasures into your temples ,
and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks , that you may remove them far from their border .
behold , I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them , and will return your repayment on your own head ;
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah , and they will sell them to the men of Sheba , to a faraway nation , for Yahweh has spoken it . "
proclaim this among the nations : " prepare for war ! stir up the mighty men . let all the warriors draw near . let them come up .
hurry and come , all you surrounding nations , and gather yourselves together . " cause your mighty ones to come down there , Yahweh .
" let the nations arouse themselves , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat ; for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations .
multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision ! for the day of Yahweh is near , in the valley of decision .
Yahweh will roar from Zion , and Thunder from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth will shake ; but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people , and a stronghold to the children of Israel .
Egypt will be a desolation , and Edom will be a desolate wilderness , for the violence done to the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
I will cleanse their blood , that I have not cleansed : for Yahweh dwells in Zion . "
he said : " Yahweh will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn , and the top of Carmel will wither . "
but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael , and it will devour the palaces of Ben Hadad .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Gaza , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they carried away captive the whole community , to deliver them up to Edom ;
but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , and it will devour its palaces .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Tyre , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they delivered up the whole community to Edom , and didn 't remember the brotherly Covenant ;
but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it will devour its palaces , with shouting in the day of battle , with a storm in the day of the whirlwind ;
but I will send a fire on Moab , and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth ; and Moab will die with tumult , with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet ;
and I will cut off the judge from their midst , and will kill all its princes with him , " says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Israel , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have sold the righteous for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ;
they trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and deny justice to the oppressed ; and a man and his father use the same maiden , to profane my holy name ;
and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge ; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined .
also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and led you forty years in the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
I raised up some of your sons for prophets , and some of your young men for Nazirites . Isn 't this true , you children of Israel ? " says Yahweh .
flight will perish from the swift ; and the strong won 't strengthen his force ; neither shall the mighty deliver himself ;
neither shall he stand who handles the bow ; and he who is swift of foot won 't escape ; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself ;
hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you , children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt , saying :
" you only have I chosen of all the families of the earth . therefore I will punish you for all of your sins . "
will a lion roar in the thicket , when he has no prey ? does a young lion cry out of his den , if he has caught nothing ?
can a bird fall in a trap on the earth , where no snare is set for him ? does a snare spring up from the ground , when there is nothing to catch ?
does the trumpet alarm sound in a city , without the people being afraid ? does evil happen to a city , and Yahweh hasn 't done it ?
the lion has roared . who will not fear ? the Lord Yahweh has spoken . who can but prophesy ?
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : " an adversary will overrun the land ; and he will pull down your strongholds , and your fortresses will be plundered . "
" for in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him , I will also visit the altars of Bethel ; and the horns of the altar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
I will strike the winter house with the summer house ; and the houses of Ivory will perish , and the great houses will have an end , " says Yahweh .
the Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness that behold , " The days shall come on you that they will take you away with hooks , and the last of you with fish hooks .
you will go out at the breaks in the wall , everyone straight before her ; and you will cast yourselves into Harmon , " says Yahweh .
offer a sacrifice of Thanksgiving of that which is leavened , and proclaim free will offerings and brag about them : for this pleases you , you children of Israel , " says the Lord Yahweh .
so two or three cities staggered to one city to drink water , and were not satisfied : yet you haven 't returned to me , " says Yahweh .
" I have overthrown some of you , as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah , and you were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire ; yet you haven 't returned to me , " says Yahweh .
listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you , O house of Israel .
" the virgin of Israel has fallen ; She shall rise no more . she is cast down on her land ; there is no one to raise her up . "
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : " the city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left , and that which went forth one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel . "
seek Yahweh , and you will live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and it devour , and there be no one to quench it in Bethel .
who brings sudden destruction on the strong , so that destruction comes on the fortress .
they hate him who reproves in the gate , and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly .
for I know how many your offenses , and how great are your sins-- you who afflict the just , who take a bribe , and who turn aside the needy in the courts .
seek good , and not evil , that you may live ; and so Yahweh , the God of Armies , will be with you , as you say .
hate evil , love good , and establish justice in the courts . it may be that Yahweh , the God of Armies , will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph . "
in all vineyards there will be wailing ; for I will pass through the midst of you , " says Yahweh .
" Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh ! why do you long for the day of Yahweh ? it is darkness , and not light .
as if a man fled from a lion , and a bear met him ; Or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall , and a snake bit him .
yes , though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings , I will not accept them ; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals .
take away from me the noise of your songs ! I will not listen to the music of your harps .
Woe to those who are at ease in Zion , and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samaria , the notable men of the chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel come !
those who put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
who lie on beds of Ivory , and stretch themselves on their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
who strum on the strings of a harp ; who invent for themselves instruments of music , like David ;
who drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the best oils ; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph .
therefore they will now go captive with the first who go captive ; and the feasting and lounging will end .
it will happen , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
" for , behold , Yahweh commands , and the great house will be smashed to pieces , and the little house into bits .
do horses run on the rocky crags ? does one plow there with oxen ? but you have turned justice into poison , and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness ;
thus the Lord Yahweh showed me : and behold , he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and behold , it was the latter growth after the king 's harvest .
thus the Lord Yahweh showed me and behold , the Lord Yahweh called for judgment by fire ; and it dried up the great deep , and would have devoured the land .
the high places of Isaac will be desolate , the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste ; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword . "
but don 't prophesy again any more at Bethel ; for it is the king 's sanctuary , and it is a royal house ! "
and Yahweh took me from following the flock , and Yahweh said to me , ' Go , prophesy to my people Israel . '
now therefore listen to the word of Yahweh : ' you say , Don 't prophesy against Israel , and don 't preach against the house of Isaac . '
the songs of the temple will be wailings in that day , " says the Lord Yahweh . " the dead bodies will be many . in every place they will throw them out with silence .
hear this , you who desire to swallow up the needy , and cause the poor of the land to fail ,
that we may buy the poor for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes , and sell the sweepings with the wheat ? ' "
won 't the land tremble for this , and everyone mourn who dwells in it ? yes , it will rise up wholly like the River ; and it will be stirred up and sink again , like the River of Egypt .
it will happen in that day , " says the Lord Yahweh , " that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will darken the earth in the clear day .
behold , the days come , " says the Lord Yahweh , " that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of Yahweh .
they will wander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east ; they will run back and forth to seek the word of Yahweh , and will not find it .
in that day the beautiful virgins and the young men will faint for thirst .
though they dig into Sheol , there my hand will take them ; and though they climb up to heaven , there I will bring them down .
though they go into captivity before their enemies , there I will command the sword , and it will kill them . I will set my eyes on them for evil , and not for good .
behold , the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom , and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth ; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob , " says Yahweh .
" for , behold , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations , as grain is sifted in a sieve , yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth .
all the sinners of my people will die by the sword , who say , ' Evil won 't overtake nor meet us . '
in that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen , and close up its breaches , and I will raise up its ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old ;
I will plant them on their land , and they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them , " says Yahweh your God .
though you mount on high as the eagle , and though your nest is set among the stars , I will bring you down from there , " says Yahweh .
" won 't I in that day , " says Yahweh , " destroy the wise men out of Edom , and understanding out of the mountain of Esau ?
your mighty men , Teman , will be dismayed , to the end that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter .
for the violence done to your brother Jacob , shame will cover you , and you will be cut off forever .
but don 't look down on your brother in the day of his disaster , and don 't rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction . Don 't speak proudly in the day of distress .
Don 't enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity . Don 't look down on their affliction in the day of their calamity , neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity .
Don 't stand in the crossroads to cut off those of his who escape . Don 't deliver up those of his who remain in the day of distress .
for the day of Yahweh is near all the nations ! as you have done , it will be done to you . your deeds will return upon your own head .
for as you have drunk on my holy mountain , so will all the nations drink continually . yes , they will drink , swallow down , and will be as though they had not been .
but in Mount Zion , there will be those who escape , and it will be holy . the house of Jacob will possess their possessions .
but Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea , and there was a mighty storm on the sea , so that the ship was likely to break up .
he said to them , " I am a Hebrew , and I fear Yahweh , the God of heaven , who has made the sea and the dry land . "
then they said to him , " What shall we do to you , that the sea may be calm to us ? " for the sea grew more and more stormy .
he said to them , " Take me up , and throw me into the sea . then the sea will be calm for you ; for I know that because of me this great storm is on you . "
nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land ; but they could not , for the sea grew more and more stormy against them .
so they took up Jonah , and threw him into the sea ; and the sea ceased its raging .
then Jonah prayed to Yahweh , his God , out of the fish 's belly .
he said , " I called because of my affliction to Yahweh . he answered me . out of the belly of Sheol I cried . you heard my voice .
for you threw me into the depths , in the heart of the seas . the flood was all around me . all your waves and your billows passed over me .
the waters surrounded me , even to the soul . the deep was around me . the weeds were wrapped around my head .
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains . the earth barred me in forever : yet have you brought up my life from the pit , Yahweh my God .
" when my soul fainted within me , I remembered Yahweh . my prayer came in to you , into your holy temple .
but I will sacrifice to you with the voice of Thanksgiving . I will pay that which I have vowed . salvation belongs to Yahweh . "
the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the second time , saying ,
so Jonah arose , and went to Nineveh , according to the word of Yahweh . now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city , three days ' journey across .
Jonah began to enter into the city a day 's journey , and he cried out , and said , " In forty days , Nineveh will be overthrown ! "
the people of Nineveh believed God ; and they proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from their greatest even to their least .
the news reached the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and took off his royal robe , covered himself with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
but let them be covered with sackcloth , both man and animal , and let them cry mightily to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his evil way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
who knows whether God will not turn and relent , and turn away from his fierce anger , so that we might not perish ? "
therefore now , Yahweh , take , I beg you , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live . "
then Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a booth , and sat under it in the shade , until he might see what would become of the city .
Yahweh God prepared a vine , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shade over his head , to deliver him from his discomfort . so Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the vine .
but God prepared a worm at dawn the next day , and it chewed on the vine , so that it withered .
Yahweh said , " You have been concerned for the vine , for which you have not labored , neither made it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night .
the word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
hear , you peoples , all of you . listen , O earth , and all that is therein : and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you , the Lord from his holy temple .
for , behold , Yahweh comes forth out of his place , and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth .
the mountains melt under him , and the valleys split apart , like wax before the fire , like waters that are poured down a steep place .
therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field , like places for planting vineyards ; and I will pour down its stones into the valley , and I will uncover its foundations .
for this I will lament and wail ; I will go stripped and naked ; I will howl like the jackals , and moan like the daughters of owls .
for her wounds are incurable ; for it has come even to Judah . it reaches to the gate of my people , even to Jerusalem .
Don 't tell it in Gath . Don 't weep at all . at Beth Ophrah I have rolled myself in the dust .
pass on , inhabitant of Shaphir , in nakedness and shame . the inhabitant of Zaanan won 't come out . the wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection .
for the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good , because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem .
harness the chariot to the swift steed , inhabitant of Lachish . she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion ; For the transgressions of Israel were found in you .
therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath . the houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel .
shave your heads , and cut off your hair for the children of your delight . enlarge your baldness like the vulture ; for they have gone into captivity from you !
Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds ! when the morning is light , they practice it , because it is in the power of their hand .
they covet fields , and seize them ; and houses , and take them away : and they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
but lately my people have risen up as an enemy . you strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care , returning from battle .
you drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses ; from their young children you take away my blessing forever .
arise , and depart ! for this is not your resting place , because of uncleanness that destroys , even with a grievous destruction .
if a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies : " I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink " ; he would be the prophet of this people .
he who breaks open the way goes up before them . they break through the gate , and go out . and their king passes on before them , with Yahweh at their head .
I said , " Please listen , you heads of Jacob , and rulers of the house of Israel : Isn 't it for you to know justice ?
you who hate the good , and love the evil ; who tear off their skin , and their flesh from off their bones ;
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them , and break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then they will cry to Yahweh , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their deeds evil . "
" therefore night is over you , with no vision , and it is dark to you , that you may not divine ; and the sun will go down on the prophets , and the day will be black over them .
the seers shall be disappointed , and the diviners confounded . yes , they shall all cover their lips ; for there is no answer from God . "
but as for me , I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh , and of judgment , and of might , to declare to Jacob his disobedience , and to Israel his sin .
please listen to this , you heads of the house of Jacob , and rulers of the house of Israel , who abhor justice , and pervert all equity .
therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field , and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble , and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest .
but in the latter days , it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh 's temple will be established on the top of the mountains , and it will be exalted above the hills ; and peoples will stream to it .
but they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and no one will make them afraid : for the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken .
indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods ; but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever .
you , tower of the flock , the hill of the daughter of Zion , to you it will come , yes , the former dominion will come , the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem .
now why do you cry out aloud ? is there no king in you ? has your counselor perished , that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail ?
now you shall gather yourself in troops , daughter of troops . he has laid siege against us . they will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek .
therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth . then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel .
he shall stand , and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh , in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God : and they will live , for then he will be great to the ends of the earth .
he will be our peace when Assyria invades our land , and when he marches through our fortresses , then we will raise against him seven shepherds , and eight leaders of men .
they will rule the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in its gates . he will deliver us from the Assyrian , when he invades our land , and when he marches within our border .
the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples , like dew from Yahweh , like showers on the grass , that don 't wait for man , nor wait for the sons of men .
let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries , and let all of your enemies be cut off .
I will cut off the cities of your land , and will tear down all your strongholds .
I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out of your midst ; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands .
I will uproot your Asherim out of your midst ; and I will destroy your cities .
I will execute vengeance in anger , and wrath on the nations that didn 't listen . "
listen now to what Yahweh says : " arise , plead your case before the mountains , and let the hills hear what you have to say .
for I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage . I sent before you Moses , Aaron , and Miriam .
how shall I come before Yahweh , and bow myself before the exalted God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with calves a year old ?
will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams ? with tens of thousands of rivers of oil ? shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience ? the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
her rich men are full of violence , her inhabitants speak lies , and their tongue is deceitful in their speech .
therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound . I have made you desolate because of your sins .
you will sow , but won 't reap . you will tread the olives , but won 't anoint yourself with oil ; and crush grapes , but won 't drink the wine .
the godly man has perished out of the earth , and there is no one upright among men . they all lie in wait for blood ; every man hunts his brother with a net .
Don 't trust in a neighbor . Don 't put confidence in a friend . with the woman lying in your embrace , be careful of the words of your mouth !
for the son dishonors the father , the daughter rises up against her mother , the daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law ; a man 's enemies are the men of his own house .
but as for me , I will look to Yahweh . I will wait for the God of my salvation . my God will hear me .
I will bear the indignation of Yahweh , because I have sinned against him , until he pleads my case , and executes judgment for me . he will bring me forth to the light . I will see his righteousness .
in that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt , and from Egypt even to the River , and from sea to sea , and mountain to mountain .
yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein , for the fruit of their doings .
" as in the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt , I will show them marvelous things . "
the nations will see and be ashamed of all their might . they will lay their hand on their mouth . their ears will be deaf .
they will lick the dust like a serpent . like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens . they will come with fear to Yahweh our God , and will be afraid because of you .
he will again have compassion on us . he will tread our iniquities under foot ; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
Yahweh is a Jealous God and avenges . Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath . Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries , and he maintains wrath against his enemies .
Yahweh is slow to anger , and great in power , and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished . Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
he rebukes the sea , and makes it dry , and dries up all the rivers . Bashan languishes , and Carmel ; and the flower of Lebanon languishes .
the mountains quake before him , and the hills melt away . the earth trembles at his presence , yes , the world , and all who dwell in it .
who can stand before his indignation ? who can endure the fierceness of his anger ? his wrath is poured out like fire , and the rocks are broken apart by him .
Yahweh is good , a stronghold in the day of trouble ; and he knows those who take refuge in him .
but with an overflowing flood , he will make a full end of her place , and will pursue his enemies into darkness .
what do you plot against Yahweh ? he will make a full end . affliction won 't rise up the second time .
thus says Yahweh : " though they be in full strength , and likewise many , even so they will be cut down , and he shall pass away . though I have afflicted you , I will afflict you no more .
now will I break his yoke from off you , and will burst your bonds apart . "
he who dashes in pieces has come up against you . keep the fortress ! watch the way ! strengthen your waist ! fortify your power mightily !
for Yahweh restores the excellency of Jacob , as the excellency of Israel ; for the destroyers have destroyed them , and ruined their vine branches .
the shield of his mighty men is made red . the valiant men are in scarlet . the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation , and the pine spears are brandished .
the chariots rage in the streets . they rush back and forth in the broad ways . their appearance is like torches . they run like the lightnings .
he summons his picked troops . they stumble on their way . they dash to its wall , and the protective shield is put in place .
it is decreed : she is uncovered , she is carried away ; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves , beating on their breasts .
take the spoil of silver . take the spoil of gold , for there is no end of the store , the glory of all goodly furniture .
the lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his caves with the kill , and his dens with prey .
Woe to the bloody city ! it is all full of lies and robbery . the prey doesn 't depart .
the noise of the whip , the noise of the rattling of wheels , prancing horses , and bounding chariots ,
I will throw abominable Filth on you , and make you vile , and will set you a spectacle .
are you better than No @-@ Amon , who was situated among the rivers , who had the waters around her ; whose rampart was the sea , and her wall was of the sea ?
you also will be drunken . you will be hidden . you also will seek a stronghold because of the enemy .
all your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first @-@ ripe figs : if they are shaken , they fall into the mouth of the eater .
behold , your troops in your midst are women . the gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies . the fire has devoured your bars .
draw water for the siege . strengthen your fortresses . go into the clay , and tread the mortar . make the brick kiln strong .
your shepherds slumber , king of Assyria . your nobles lie down . your people are scattered on the mountains , and there is no one to gather them .
" look among the nations , watch , and wonder marvelously ; for I am working a work in your days , which you will not believe though it is told you .
for , behold , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , that march through the breadth of the earth , to possess dwelling places that are not theirs .
they are feared and dreaded . their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves .
their horses also are swifter than leopards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves . their horsemen press proudly on . yes , their horsemen come from afar . they fly as an eagle that hurries to devour .
yes , he scoffs at kings , and princes are a derision to him . he laughs at every stronghold , for he builds up an earthen ramp , and takes it .
then he sweeps by like the wind , and goes on . he is indeed guilty , whose strength is his god . "
and make men like the fish of the sea , like the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
he takes up all of them with the hook . he catches them in his net , and gathers them in his dragnet . therefore he rejoices and is glad .
therefore he sacrifices to his net , and burns incense to his dragnet , because by them his life is luxurious , and his food is good .
I will stand at my watch , and set myself on the ramparts , and will look out to see what he will say to me , and what I will answer concerning my complaint .
for the vision is yet for the appointed time , and it hurries toward the end , and won 't prove false . though it takes time , wait for it ; because it will surely come . it won 't delay .
behold , his soul is puffed up . it is not upright in him , but the righteous will live by his faith .
Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the hand of evil !
you have devised shame to your house , by cutting off many peoples , and have sinned against your soul .
for the stone will cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it .
Woe to him who builds a town with blood , and establishes a city by iniquity !
behold , isn 't it of Yahweh of Armies that the peoples labor for the fire , and the nations weary themselves for vanity ?
for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh , as the waters cover the sea .
" Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink , pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk , so that you may gaze at their naked bodies !
his splendor is like the sunrise . rays shine from his hand , where his power is hidden .
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction . the dwellings of the land of Midian trembled .
was Yahweh displeased with the rivers ? was your anger against the rivers , or your wrath against the sea , that you rode on your horses , on your chariots of salvation ?
you uncovered your bow . you called for your sworn arrows . Selah . you split the earth with rivers .
the mountains saw you , and were afraid . the storm of waters passed by . the deep roared and lifted up its hands on high .
the sun and moon stood still in the sky , at the light of your arrows as they went , at the shining of your glittering spear .
you went forth for the salvation of your people , for the salvation of your anointed . you crushed the head of the land of wickedness . you stripped them head to foot . Selah .
you pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears . they came as a whirlwind to scatter me , gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret .
yet I will rejoice in Yahweh . I will be joyful in the God of my salvation !
I will utterly sweep away everything off of the surface of the earth , says Yahweh .
be silent at the presence of the Lord Yahweh , for the day of Yahweh is at hand . for Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice . he has consecrated his guests .
in that day , says Yahweh , there will be the noise of a cry from the fish gate , a wailing from the second quarter , and a great crashing from the hills .
Wail , you inhabitants of Maktesh , for all the people of Canaan are undone ! all those who were loaded with silver are cut off .
their wealth will become a spoil , and their houses a desolation . yes , they will build houses , but won 't inhabit them . they will plant vineyards , but won 't drink their wine .
the great day of Yahweh is near . it is near , and hurries greatly , the voice of the day of Yahweh . the mighty man cries there bitterly .
seek Yahweh , all you humble of the land , who have kept his ordinances . seek righteousness . seek humility . it may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh 's anger .
for Gaza will be forsaken , and Ashkelon a desolation . they will drive out Ashdod at noonday , and Ekron will be rooted up .
this they will have for their pride , because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Yahweh of Armies .
Yahweh will be awesome to them , for he will famish all the gods of the land . men will worship him , everyone from his place , even all the shores of the nations .
he will stretch out his hand against the north , destroy Assyria , and will make Nineveh a desolation , as dry as the wilderness .
she didn 't obey the voice . she didn 't receive correction . she didn 't trust in Yahweh . she didn 't draw near to her God .
her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions . her judges are evening wolves . they leave nothing until the next day .
her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people . her priests have profaned the sanctuary . they have done violence to the law .
for then I will purify the lips of the peoples , that they may all call on the name of Yahweh , to serve him shoulder to shoulder .
from beyond the rivers of Cush , my worshipers , even the daughter of my dispersed people , will bring my offering .
but I will leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people , and they will take refuge in the name of Yahweh .
the remnant of Israel will not do iniquity , nor speak lies , neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth , for they will feed and lie down , and no one will make them afraid . "
in that day , it will be said to Jerusalem , " Don 't be afraid , Zion . Don 't let your hands be weak . "
" this is what Yahweh of Armies says : these people say , ' The time hasn 't yet come , the time for Yahweh 's house to be built . ' "
in the seventh month , in the twenty @-@ first day of the month , the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet , saying ,
" speak now to Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua , the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and to the remnant of the people , saying ,
'Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory ? how do you see it now ? Isn 't it in your eyes as nothing ?
this is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt , and my Spirit lived among you . ' Don 't be afraid . '
for this is what Yahweh of Armies says : ' yet once , it is a little while , and I will shake the heavens , the earth , the sea , and the dry land ;
in the twenty @-@ fourth day of the ninth month , in the second year of Darius , the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet , saying ,
I struck you with blight , mildew , and hail in all the work of your hands ; yet you didn 't turn to me , ' says Yahweh .
'Consider , please , from this day and backward , from the twenty @-@ fourth day of the ninth month , since the day that the foundation of Yahweh 's temple was laid , consider it .
is the seed yet in the barn ? yes , the vine , the fig tree , the pomegranate , and the olive tree haven 't brought forth . from this day will I bless you . ' "
the Word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the twenty @-@ fourth day of the month , saying ,
" speak to Zerubbabel , governor of Judah , saying , ' I will shake the heavens and the earth .
in the eighth month , in the second year of Darius , the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , the prophet , saying ,
therefore tell them : thus says Yahweh of Armies : ' return to me , ' says Yahweh of Armies , ' and I will return to you , ' says Yahweh of Armies .
the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered , " They are the ones Yahweh has sent to go back and forth through the earth . "
they reported to the angel of Yahweh who stood among the myrtle trees , and said , " We have walked back and forth through the earth , and behold , all the earth is at rest and in peace . "
I am very angry with the nations that are at ease ; for I was but a little displeased , but they added to the calamity . "
I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , a man with a measuring line in his hand .
behold , the angel who talked with me went forth , and another angel went out to meet him ,
for I , ' says Yahweh , ' will be to her a wall of fire around it , and I will be the glory in the midst of her .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies : ' for honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you ; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye .
sing and rejoice , daughter of Zion ; for , behold , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of you , ' says Yahweh .
many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day , and shall be my people ; and I will dwell in the midst of you , and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you .
he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh , and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary .
I said , " Let them set a clean turban on his head . " so they set a clean turban on his head , and clothed him ; and the angel of Yahweh was standing by .
in that day , ' says Yahweh of Armies , ' you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree . ' "
the angel who talked with me came again , and wakened me , as a man who is wakened out of his sleep .
and two olive trees by it , one on the right side of the bowl , and the other on the left side of it . "
I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me , saying , " What are these , my lord ? "
then the angel who talked with me answered me , " Don 't you know what these are ? " I said , " No , my lord . "
" the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house . his hands shall also finish it ; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you .
then I asked him , " What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it ? "
I asked him the second time , " What are these two olive branches , which are beside the two golden spouts , that pour the golden oil out of themselves ? "
then again I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , a flying scroll .
then the angel who talked with me came forward , and said to me , " Lift up now your eyes , and see what is this that is appearing . "
( and behold , a talent of lead was lifted up ) ; and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah basket . "
he said , " This is Wickedness " ; and he threw her down into the midst of the ephah basket ; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth .
then I said to the angel who talked with me , " Where are these carrying the ephah basket ? "
in the first chariot were red horses ; in the second chariot black horses ;
in the third chariot white horses ; and in the fourth chariot dappled horses , all of them powerful .
the angel answered me , " These are the four winds of the sky , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
the one with the black horses goes out toward the north country ; and the white went out after them ; and the dappled went forth toward the south country . "
the strong went out , and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth : and he said , " Go around and through the earth ! " so they walked back and forth through the earth .
" take of them of the captivity , even of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah ; and come the same day , and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah , where they have come from Babylon .
yes , take silver and gold , and make crowns , and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest ;
and speak to him , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " behold , the man whose name is the Branch : and he shall grow up out of his place ; and he shall build Yahweh 's temple ;
it happened in the fourth year of king Darius that the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month , the month of Chislev .
when you eat , and when you drink , don 't you eat for yourselves , and drink for yourselves ?
" thus has Yahweh of Armies spoken , saying , ' execute true judgment , and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother .
Don 't oppress the widow , nor the fatherless , the foreigner , nor the poor ; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart . '
but they refused to listen , and turned their backs , and stopped their ears , that they might not hear .
it has come to pass that , as he called , and they refused to listen , so they will call , and I will not listen , " said Yahweh of Armies ;
so again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah . Don 't be afraid .
these are the things that you shall do : speak every man the truth with his neighbor . execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates ,
and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor , and love no false oath : for all these are things that I hate , " says Yahweh .
and the inhabitants of one shall go to another , saying , ' Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Yahweh , and to seek Yahweh of Armies . I will go also . '
yes , many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Yahweh of Armies in Jerusalem , and to entreat the favor of Yahweh . "
an oracle . the word of Yahweh is against the land of Hadrach , and will rest upon Damascus ; for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh ;
tyre built herself a stronghold , and heaped up silver like the dust , and fine gold like the mire of the streets .
behold , the Lord will dispossess her , and he will strike her power in the sea ; and she will be devoured with fire .
Ashkelon will see it , and fear ; Gaza also , and will writhe in agony ; as will Ekron , for her expectation will be disappointed ; and the king will perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon will not be inhabited .
foreigners will dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines .
I will encamp around my house against the army , that none pass through or return ; and no oppressor will pass through them any more : for now I have seen with my eyes .
as for you also , because of the blood of your Covenant , I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water .
Yahweh will be seen over them ; and his arrow will go flash like lightning ; and the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet , and will go with whirlwinds of the south .
Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people ; for they are like the jewels of a crown , lifted on high over his land .
for how great is his Goodness , and how great is his beauty ! grain will make the young men flourish , and new wine the virgins .
ask of Yahweh rain in the spring time , Yahweh who makes storm clouds , and he gives rain showers to everyone for the plants in the field .
from him will come forth the cornerstone , from him the nail , from him the battle bow , from him every ruler together .
they shall be as mighty men , treading down muddy streets in the battle ; and they shall fight , because Yahweh is with them ; and the riders on horses will be confounded .
I will signal for them , and gather them ; for I have redeemed them ; and they will increase as they have increased .
I will sow them among the peoples ; and they will remember me in far countries ; and they will live with their children , and will return .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon ; and there won 't be room enough for them .
Wail , fir tree , for the cedar has fallen , because the stately ones are destroyed . Wail , you oaks of Bashan , for the strong forest has come down .
a voice of the wailing of the shepherds ! for their glory is destroyed : a voice of the roaring of young lions ! for the pride of the Jordan is ruined .
I cut off the three shepherds in one month ; for my soul was weary of them , and their soul also loathed me .
I took my staff favor , and cut it apart , that I might break my Covenant that I had made with all the peoples .
it was broken in that day ; and thus the poor of the flock that listened to me knew that it was the word of Yahweh .
I said to them , " If you think it best , give me my wages ; and if not , keep them . " so they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver .
an oracle . the word of Yahweh concerning Israel . Yahweh , who stretches out the heavens , and lays the foundation of the earth , and forms the spirit of man within him says :
" behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples , and on Judah also will it be in the siege against Jerusalem .
the chieftains of Judah will say in their heart , ' The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of Armies their God . '
Yahweh also will save the tents of Judah first , that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem not be magnified above Judah .
in that day Yahweh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem . he who is feeble among them at that day will be like David , and the house of David will be like God , like the angel of Yahweh before them .
it will happen in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
" in that day there will be a spring opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , for sin and for uncleanness .
it will happen in that day , that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision , when he prophesies ; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive :
but he will say , ' I am no prophet , I am a tiller of the ground ; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth . '
it shall happen that in all the land , " says Yahweh , " two parts in it will be cut off and die ; but the third will be left in it .
then Yahweh will go out and fight against those nations , as when he fought in the day of battle .
it will happen in that day , that there will not be light , cold , or Frost .
it will be a unique day which is known to Yahweh ; not day , and not night ; but it will come to pass , that at evening time there will be light .
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
Yahweh will be King over all the earth . in that day Yahweh will be one , and his name one .
men will dwell therein , and there will be no more curse ; but Jerusalem will dwell safely .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor .
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together : gold , and silver , and clothing , in great abundance .
so will be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the Camel , and of the donkey , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that plague .
it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , and to keep the feast of tents .
it will be , that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn 't go up to Jerusalem to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , on them there will be no rain .
this will be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all the nations that don 't go up to keep the feast of tents .
in that day there will be on the bells of the horses , " Holy TO YAHWEH " ; and the pots in Yahweh 's house will be like the bowls before the altar .
" now , please entreat the favor of God , that he may be gracious to us . with this , will he accept any of you ? " says Yahweh of Armies .
" but you profane it , in that you say , ' Yahweh 's table is polluted , and its fruit , even its food , is contemptible . '
behold , I will rebuke your seed , and will spread Dung on your faces , even the Dung of your feasts ; and you will be taken away with it .
you will know that I have sent this commandment to you , that my Covenant may be with Levi , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" my Covenant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me ; and he was reverent toward me , and stood in awe of my name .
for the priest 's lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth ; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies .
but you have turned aside out of the way . you have caused many to stumble in the law . you have corrupted the Covenant of Levi , " says Yahweh of Armies .
Don 't we all have one father ? Hasn 't one God created us ? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother , profaning the Covenant of our fathers ?
Judah has dealt treacherously , and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves , and has married the daughter of a foreign god .
Yahweh will cut off , to the man who does this , him who wakes and him who answers , out of the tents of Jacob , and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies .
yet you say , ' Why ? ' because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth , against whom you have dealt treacherously , though she is your companion , and the wife of your Covenant .
" but who can endure the day of his coming ? and who will stand when he appears ? for he is like a refiner 's fire , and like launderer 's soap ;
then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Yahweh , as in the days of old , and as in ancient years .
you are Cursed with the curse ; for you rob me , even this whole nation .
I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes , and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground ; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field , " says Yahweh of Armies .
now we call the proud happy ; yes , those who work wickedness are built up ; yes , they tempt God , and escape . '
but to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings . you will go out , and leap like calves of the stall .
you shall tread down the wicked ; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make , " says Yahweh of Armies .
he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the hearts of the children to their fathers , lest I come and strike the earth with a curse . "
Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar . Perez became the father of Hezron . Hezron became the father of Ram .
ram became the father of Amminadab . Amminadab became the father of Nahshon . Nahshon became the father of salmon .
salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab . Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth . Obed became the father of Jesse .
Jesse became the father of King David . David became the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah .
Solomon became the father of Rehoboam . Rehoboam became the father of Abijah . Abijah became the father of ASA .
ASA became the father of Jehoshaphat . Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram . Joram became the father of Uzziah .
Uzziah became the father of Jotham . Jotham became the father of Ahaz . Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah .
Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh . Manasseh became the father of Amon . Amon became the father of Josiah .
Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers , at the time of the exile to Babylon .
Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud . Abiud became the father of Eliakim . Eliakim became the father of Azor .
Azor became the father of Sadoc . Sadoc became the father of Achim . Achim became the father of Eliud .
Eliud became the father of Eleazar . Eleazar became the father of Matthan . Matthan became the father of Jacob .
Jacob became the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary , from whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ , fourteen generations .
now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this ; for after his mother , Mary , was engaged to Joseph , before they came together , she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit .
Joseph , her husband , being a righteous man , and not willing to make her a public example , intended to put her away secretly .
she shall bring forth a son . you shall call his name Jesus , for it is he who shall save his people from their sins . "
now all this has happened , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying ,
" behold , the virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son . they shall call his name Immanuel " ; which is , being interpreted , " God with us . "
Joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took his wife to himself ;
and didn 't know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son . he named him Jesus .
gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he asked them where the Christ would be born .
'You Bethlehem , land of Judah , are in no way least among the princes of Judah : for out of you shall come forth a governor , who shall shepherd my people , Israel . ' "
they , having heard the king , went their way ; and behold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .
when they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy .
they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary , his mother , and they fell down and worshiped him . opening their treasures , they offered to him gifts : gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
being warned in a dream that they shouldn 't return to Herod , they went back to their own country another way .
and was there until the death of Herod ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , " Out of Egypt I called my son . "
" a voice was heard in Ramah , lamentation , weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children ; she wouldn 't be comforted , because they are no more . "
he arose and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
but when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father , Herod , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Galilee ,
in those days , John the Baptizer came , preaching in the wilderness of Judea , saying ,
for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet , saying , " The voice of one crying in the wilderness , make ready the way of the Lord . make his paths straight . "
now John himself wore clothing made of Camel 's hair , with a leather belt around his waist . his food was locusts and wild honey .
Don 't think to yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father , ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones .
" even now the axe lies at the root of the trees . therefore every tree that doesn 't bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
behold , a voice out of the heavens said , " This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . "
the tempter came and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , command that these stones become bread . "
but he answered , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God . ' "
Jesus said to him , " Again , it is written , ' You shall not test the Lord , your God . ' "
again , the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world , and their glory .
he said to him , " I will give you all of these things , if you will fall down and worship me . "
then Jesus said to him , " Get behind me , Satan ! for it is written , ' You shall worship the Lord your God , and you shall serve him only . ' "
leaving Nazareth , he came and lived in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
the people who sat in darkness saw a great light , to those who sat in the region and shadow of death , to them light has dawned . "
walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers : Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew , his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fishermen .
going on from there , he saw two other brothers , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets . he called them .
the report about him went out into all Syria . they brought to him all who were sick , afflicted with various diseases and torments , possessed with demons , epileptics , and paralytics ; and he healed them .
seeing the multitudes , he went up onto the mountain . when he had sat down , his disciples came to him .
blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness ' sake , for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven .
rejoice , and be exceedingly glad , for great is your reward in heaven . for that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
you are the light of the world . a city located on a hill can 't be hidden .
neither do you light a lamp , and put it under a measuring basket , but on a stand ; and it shines to all who are in the house .
even so , let your light shine before men ; that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in heaven .
for I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
" you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones , ' You shall not murder ; ' and ' Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment . '
agree with your adversary quickly , while you are with him in the way ; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge , and the judge deliver you to the officer , and you be cast into prison .
most certainly I tell you , you shall by no means get out of there , until you have paid the last penny .
" it was also said , ' Whoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorce , '
but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife , except for the cause of sexual immorality , makes her an adulteress ; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery .
" again you have heard that it was said to them of old time , ' You shall not make false vows , but shall perform to the Lord your vows , '
but let your ' Yes ' be ' Yes ' and your ' No ' be ' No . ' whatever is more than these is of the evil one .
" you have heard that it was said , ' An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . '
but I tell you , don 't resist him who is evil ; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek , turn to him the other also .
if anyone sues you to take away your coat , let him have your cloak also .
give to him who asks you , and don 't turn away him who desires to borrow from you .
" you have heard that it was said , ' You shall love your neighbor , and hate your enemy . '
but I tell you , love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you ,
that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven . for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good , and sends rain on the just and the unjust .
for if you love those who love you , what reward do you have ? Don 't even the tax collectors do the same ?
if you only greet your friends , what more do you do than others ? Don 't even the tax collectors do the same ?
" be careful that you don 't do your charitable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven .
but when you do merciful deeds , don 't let your left hand know what your right hand does ,
but you , when you pray , enter into your inner room , and having shut your door , pray to your Father who is in secret , and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly .
in praying , don 't use vain repetitions , as the Gentiles do ; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking .
let your Kingdom come . let your will be done , as in heaven , so on earth .
bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . for yours is the Kingdom , the power , and the glory forever . Amen . '
so that you are not seen by men to be fasting , but by your Father who is in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
" Don 't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal ;
" the lamp of the body is the eye . if therefore your eye is sound , your whole body will be full of light .
but if your eye is evil , your whole body will be full of darkness . if therefore the light that is in you is darkness , how great is the darkness !
see the birds of the sky , that they don 't sow , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns . your heavenly Father feeds them . Aren 't you of much more value than they ?
" which of you , by being anxious , can add one moment to his lifespan ?
why are you anxious about clothing ? consider the lilies of the field , how they grow . they don 't toil , neither do they spin ,
but if God so clothes the grass of the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , won 't he much more clothe you , you of little faith ?
" therefore don 't be anxious , saying , ' What will we eat ? ' , ' What will we drink ? ' or , ' With what will we be clothed ? '
but seek first God 's Kingdom , and his righteousness ; and all these things will be given to you as well .
for with whatever judgment you judge , you will be judged ; and with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you .
why do you see the speck that is in your brother 's eye , but don 't consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
or how will you tell your brother , ' Let me remove the speck from your eye ; ' and behold , the beam is in your own eye ?
you hypocrite ! first remove the beam out of your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother 's eye .
" Don 't give that which is holy to the dogs , neither throw your pearls before the pigs , lest perhaps they trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .
" ask , and it will be given you . seek , and you will find . knock , and it will be opened for you .
for everyone who asks receives . he who seeks finds . to him who knocks it will be opened .
or who is there among you , who , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
or if he asks for a fish , who will give him a serpent ?
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
" enter in by the narrow gate ; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction , and many are those who enter in by it .
how narrow is the gate , and restricted is the way that leads to life ! few are those who find it .
by their fruits you will know them . do you gather grapes from thorns , or figs from thistles ?
a good tree can 't produce evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit .
every tree that doesn 't grow good fruit is cut down , and thrown into the fire .
not everyone who says to me , ' Lord , Lord , ' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven ; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
" everyone therefore who hears these words of mine , and does them , I will liken him to a wise man , who built his house on a rock .
the rain came down , the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat on that house ; and it didn 't fall , for it was founded on the rock .
everyone who hears these words of mine , and doesn 't do them will be like a foolish man , who built his house on the sand .
the rain came down , the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat on that house ; and it fell--and great was its fall . "
it happened , when Jesus had finished saying these things , that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching ,
Jesus stretched out his hand , and touched him , saying , " I want to . be made clean . " immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west , and will sit down with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven ,
but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness . there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . "
when Jesus came into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother lying sick with a fever .
when evening came , they brought to him many possessed with demons . he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were sick ;
now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him , he gave the order to depart to the other side .
Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head . "
behold , a violent storm came up on the sea , so much that the boat was covered with the waves , but he was asleep .
he said to them , " Why are you fearful , O you of little faith ? " then he got up , rebuked the wind and the sea , and there was a great calm .
the demons begged him , saying , " If you cast us out , permit us to go away into the herd of pigs . "
those who fed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , including what happened to those who were possessed with demons .
behold , all the city came out to meet Jesus . when they saw him , they begged that he would depart from their borders .
he entered into a boat , and crossed over , and came into his own city .
for which is easier , to say , ' Your sins are forgiven ; ' or to say , ' Get up , and walk ? '
but when the multitudes saw it , they marveled and glorified God , who had given such authority to men .
as Jesus passed by from there , he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office . he said to him , " Follow me . " he got up and followed him .
it happened as he sat in the house , behold , many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples .
when Jesus heard it , he said to them , " Those who are healthy have no need for a physician , but those who are sick do .
but you go and learn what this means : ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' for I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . "
no one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment ; for the patch would tear away from the garment , and a worse hole is made .
behold , a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him , and touched the fringe of his garment ;
for she said within herself , " If I just touch his garment , I will be made well . "
but Jesus , turning around and seeing her , said , " Daughter , cheer up ! your faith has made you well . " and the woman was made well from that hour .
but when the crowd was put out , he entered in , took her by the hand , and the girl arose .
as they went out , behold , a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him .
when the demon was cast out , the mute man spoke . the multitudes marveled , saying , " Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel ! "
Jesus went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion for them , because they were harassed and scattered , like sheep without a shepherd .
Jesus sent these twelve out , and commanded them , saying , " Don 't go among the Gentiles , and don 't enter into any city of the Samaritans .
as you go , preach , saying , ' The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand ! '
into whatever city or village you enter , find out who in it is worthy ; and stay there until you go on .
if the household is worthy , let your peace come on it , but if it isn 't worthy , let your peace return to you .
whoever doesn 't receive you , nor hear your words , as you go out of that house or that city , shake off the dust from your feet .
most certainly I tell you , it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city .
" behold , I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves . therefore be wise as Serpents , and harmless as doves .
but beware of men : for they will deliver you up to councils , and in their synagogues they will scourge you .
yes , and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the nations .
but when they deliver you up , don 't be anxious how or what you will say , for it will be given you in that hour what you will say .
for it is not you who speak , but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
you will be hated by all men for my name 's sake , but he who endures to the end will be saved .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
it is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher , and the servant like his lord . if they have called the master of the house Beelzebul , how much more those of his household !
what I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear whispered in the ear , proclaim on the housetops .
" Aren 't two sparrows sold for an assarion coin ? not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father 's will ,
" Don 't think that I came to send peace on the earth . I didn 't come to send peace , but a sword .
for I came to set a man at odds against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn 't worthy of me .
he who doesn 't take his cross and follow after me , isn 't worthy of me .
he who seeks his life will lose it ; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it .
he who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet 's reward . he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man 's reward .
whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple , most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward . "
the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have good news preached to them .
as these went their way , Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? a Reed shaken by the wind ?
but what did you go out to see ? a man in soft clothing ? behold , those who wear soft clothing are in king 's houses .
for this is he , of whom it is written , ' behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
most certainly I tell you , among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer ; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he .
from the days of John the Baptizer until now , the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence , and the violent take it by force .
but I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
you , Capernaum , who are exalted to heaven , you will go down to Hades . for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .
but I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom , on the day of judgment , than for you . "
yes , Father , for so it was well @-@ pleasing in your sight .
take my yoke upon you , and learn from me , for I am gentle and lowly in heart ; and you will find rest for your souls .
at that time , Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields . his disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat .
but the Pharisees , when they saw it , said to him , " behold , your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath . "
but he said to them , " haven 't you read what David did , when he was hungry , and those who were with him ;
or have you not read in the law , that on the Sabbath day , the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath , and are guiltless ?
but if you had known what this means , ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' you would not have condemned the guiltless .
of how much more value then is a man than a sheep ! therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day . "
then he told the man , " Stretch out your hand . " he stretched it out ; and it was restored whole , just like the other .
he will not strive , nor shout ; neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets .
he won 't break a bruised Reed . he won 't quench a smoking flax , until he leads justice to victory .
but when the Pharisees heard it , they said , " This man does not cast out demons , except by Beelzebul , the prince of the demons . "
knowing their thoughts , Jesus said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation , and every city or house divided against itself will not stand .
but if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons , then the Kingdom of God has come upon you .
or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and plunder his goods , unless he first bind the strong man ? then he will plunder his house .
" he who is not with me is against me , and he who doesn 't gather with me , scatters .
whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
you offspring of vipers , how can you , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth speaks .
the good man out of his good treasure brings out good things , and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things .
I tell you that every idle word that men speak , they will give account of it in the day of judgment .
for by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned . "
the men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation , and will condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , someone greater than Jonah is here .
but the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passes through waterless places , seeking rest , and doesn 't find it .
then he says , ' I will return into my house from which I came out , ' and when he has come back , he finds it empty , swept , and put in order .
while he was yet speaking to the multitudes , behold , his mother and his brothers stood outside , seeking to speak to him .
great multitudes gathered to him , so that he entered into a boat , and sat , and all the multitude stood on the beach .
as he sowed , some seeds fell by the roadside , and the birds came and devoured them .
others fell on rocky ground , where they didn 't have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , because they had no depth of earth .
when the sun had risen , they were scorched . because they had no root , they withered away .
he who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
he answered them , " To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven , but it is not given to them .
therefore I speak to them in parables , because seeing they don 't see , and hearing , they don 't hear , neither do they understand .
in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled , which says , ' By hearing you will hear , and will in no way understand ; seeing you will see , and will in no way perceive :
for most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them .
when anyone hears the word of the Kingdom , and doesn 't understand it , the evil one comes , and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart . this is what was sown by the roadside .
what was sown among the thorns , this is he who hears the word , but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
but while people slept , his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also among the wheat , and went away .
but when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit , then the darnel weeds appeared also .
the servants of the householder came and said to him , ' Sir , didn 't you sow good seed in your field ? where did this darnel come from ? '
" he said to them , ' An enemy has done this . ' " the servants asked him , ' Do you want us to go and gather them up ? '
" but he said , ' No , lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds , you root up the wheat with them .
he set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field ;
Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes ; and without a parable , he didn 't speak to them ,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying , " I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world . "
then Jesus sent the multitudes away , and went into the house . his disciples came to him , saying , " explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field . "
the field is the world ; and the good seed , these are the children of the Kingdom ; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one .
the enemy who sowed them is the devil . the harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are angels .
as therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire ; so will it be at the end of this age .
then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father . he who has ears to hear , let him hear .
" again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls ,
" again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet , that was cast into the sea , and gathered some fish of every kind ,
which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . they sat down , and gathered the good into containers , but the bad they threw away .
it happened that when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed from there .
they were offended by him . but Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and in his own house . "
for Herod had laid hold of John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife .
when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
but when Herod 's birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod .
the king was grieved , but for the sake of his oaths , and of those who sat at the table with him , he commanded it to be given ,
his head was brought on a platter , and given to the young lady : and she brought it to her mother .
now when Jesus heard this , he withdrew from there in a boat , to a deserted place apart . when the multitudes heard it , they followed him on foot from the cities .
Jesus went out , and he saw a great multitude . he had compassion on them , and healed their sick .
but Jesus said to them , " They don 't need to go away . you give them something to eat . "
they all ate , and were filled . they took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces .
immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead of him to the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
after he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into the mountain by himself to pray . when evening had come , he was there alone .
but the boat was now in the middle of the sea , distressed by the waves , for the wind was contrary .
in the fourth watch of the night , Jesus came to them , walking on the sea .
when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , " It 's a ghost ! " and they cried out for fear .
but when he saw that the wind was strong , he was afraid , and beginning to sink , he cried out , saying , " Lord , save me ! "
immediately Jesus stretched out his hand , took hold of him , and said to him , " You of little faith , why did you doubt ? "
those who were in the boat came and worshiped him , saying , " You are truly the Son of God ! "
when they had crossed over , they came to the land of Gennesaret .
when the people of that place recognized him , they sent into all that surrounding region , and brought to him all who were sick ,
and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment . as many as touched it were made whole .
for God commanded , ' honor your father and your mother , ' and , ' He who speaks evil of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
you hypocrites ! well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying ,
that which enters into the mouth doesn 't defile the man ; but that which proceeds out of the mouth , this defiles the man . "
leave them alone . they are blind guides of the blind . if the blind guide the blind , both will fall into a pit . "
Don 't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly , and then out of the body ?
but the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart , and they defile the man .
these are the things which defile the man ; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn 't defile the man . "
Jesus went out from there , and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon .
Jesus departed there , and came near to the sea of Galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking , injured whole , lame walking , and blind seeing--and they glorified the God of Israel .
and he took the seven loaves and the fish . he gave thanks and broke them , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
they all ate , and were filled . they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
then he sent away the multitudes , got into the boat , and came into the borders of Magdala .
but he answered them , " When it is evening , you say , ' It will be fair weather , for the sky is red . '
an evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and there will be no sign given to it , except the sign of the prophet Jonah . " he left them , and departed .
Jesus , perceiving it , said , " Why do you reason among yourselves , you of little faith , ' because you have brought no bread ? '
how is it that you don 't perceive that I didn 't speak to you concerning bread ? but beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
then they understood that he didn 't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , " Who do men say that I , the Son of Man , am ? "
I also tell you that you are Peter , and on this rock I will build my assembly , and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it .
I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven , and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven ; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven . "
from that time , Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
then Jesus said to his disciples , " If anyone desires to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever desires to save his life will lose it , and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it .
for what will it profit a man , if he gains the whole world , and forfeits his life ? or what will a man give in exchange for his life ?
most certainly I tell you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death , until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom . "
after six days , Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John his brother , and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves .
when the disciples heard it , they fell on their faces , and were very afraid .
lifting up their eyes , they saw no one , except Jesus alone .
but I tell you that Elijah has come already , and they didn 't recognize him , but did to him whatever they wanted to . even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them . "
when they came to the multitude , a man came to him , kneeling down to him , saying ,
so I brought him to your disciples , and they could not cure him . "
Jesus rebuked him , the demon went out of him , and the boy was cured from that hour .
when they had come to Capernaum , those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter , and said , " Doesn 't your teacher pay the didrachma ? "
whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child , the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven .
" Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling ! for it must be that the occasions come , but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes !
see that you don 't despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven .
if he finds it , most certainly I tell you , he rejoices over it more than over the ninety @-@ nine which have not gone astray .
even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish .
but if he doesn 't listen , take one or two more with you , that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
if he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the assembly . if he refuses to hear the assembly also , let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector .
most certainly I tell you , whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven , and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven .
again , assuredly I tell you , that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask , it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven .
therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king , who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants .
but because he couldn 't pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , with his wife , his children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
the servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him , saying , ' Lord , have patience with me , and I will repay you all ! '
the lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt .
" so his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him , saying , ' Have patience with me , and I will repay you ! '
he would not , but went and cast him into prison , until he should pay back that which was due .
so when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were exceedingly sorry , and came and told to their lord all that was done .
Shouldn 't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant , even as I had mercy on you ? '
his lord was angry , and delivered him to the tormentors , until he should pay all that was due to him .
so my heavenly Father will also do to you , if you don 't each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds . "
it happened when Jesus had finished these words , he departed from Galilee , and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan .
so that they are no more two , but one flesh . what therefore God has joined together , don 't let man tear apart . "
he said to them , " Moses , because of the hardness of your hearts , allowed you to divorce your wives , but from the beginning it has not been so .
Jesus said to him , " If you want to be perfect , go , sell what you have , and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . "
but when the young man heard the saying , he went away sad , for he was one who had great possessions .
again I tell you , it is easier for a Camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
" for the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
when evening had come , the lord of the vineyard said to his manager , ' Call the laborers and pay them their wages , beginning from the last to the first . '
" when those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came , they each received a denarius .
when they received it , they murmured against the master of the household ,
saying , ' These last have spent one hour , and you have made them equal to us , who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat ! '
take that which is yours , and go your way . it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you .
Isn 't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own ? or is your eye evil , because I am good ? '
so the last will be first , and the first last . for many are called , but few are chosen . "
when the ten heard it , they were indignant with the two brothers .
but Jesus summoned them , and said , " You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
it shall not be so among you , but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant .
even as the Son of Man came not to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . "
behold , two blind men sitting by the road , when they heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out , " Lord , have mercy on us , you son of David ! "
the multitude rebuked them , telling them that they should be quiet , but they cried out even more , " Lord , have mercy on us , you son of David ! "
if anyone says anything to you , you shall say , ' The Lord needs them , ' and immediately he will send them . "
" tell the daughter of Zion , behold , your King comes to you , humble , and riding on a donkey , on a colt , the foal of a donkey . "
and brought the donkey and the colt , and laid their clothes on them ; and he sat on them .
a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road . others cut branches from the trees , and spread them on the road .
the multitudes who went before him , and who followed kept shouting , " Hosanna to the son of David ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
the blind and the lame came to him in the temple , and he healed them .
but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children who were crying in the temple and saying , " Hosanna to the son of David ! " they were indignant ,
now in the morning , as he returned to the city , he was hungry .
but what do you think ? a man had two sons , and he came to the first , and said , ' Son , go work today in my vineyard . '
he came to the second , and said the same thing . he answered , ' I go , sir , ' but he didn 't go .
when the season for the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the farmers , to receive his fruit .
but afterward he sent to them his son , saying , ' They will respect my son . '
but the farmers , when they saw the son , said among themselves , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , and seize his inheritance . '
so they took him , and threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
" therefore I tell you , the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you , and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit .
Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them , saying ,
and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast , but they would not come .
but they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his own farm , another to his merchandise ,
and the rest grabbed his servants , and treated them shamefully , and killed them .
when the king heard that , he was angry , and sent his armies , destroyed those murderers , and burned their city .
those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together as many as they found , both bad and good . the wedding was filled with guests .
but when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man who didn 't have on wedding clothing ,
when they heard it , they marveled , and left him , and went away .
now there were with us seven brothers . the first married and died , and having no seed left his wife to his brother .
for in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are like God 's angels in heaven .
but concerning the resurrection of the dead , haven 't you read that which was spoken to you by God , saying ,
'i am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? ' God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . "
but the Pharisees , when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees , gathered themselves together .
one of them , a lawyer , asked him a question , testing him .
Jesus said to him , " ' You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , and with all your mind . '
'The Lord said to my Lord , sit on my right hand , until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet ? '
then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples ,
all things therefore whatever they tell you to observe , observe and do , but don 't do their works ; for they say , and don 't do .
for they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them .
but all their works they do to be seen by men . they make their phylacteries broad , enlarge the fringes of their garments ,
and love the place of honor at feasts , the best seats in the synagogues ,
but don 't you be called ' Rabbi , ' for one is your teacher , the Christ , and all of you are brothers .
whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted .
" Woe to you , you blind guides , who say , ' Whoever swears by the temple , it is nothing ; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple , he is obligated . '
he who swears by heaven , swears by the throne of God , and by him who sits on it .
" Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness .
you blind Pharisee , first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter , that its outside may become clean also .
even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men , but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
" Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you build the tombs of the prophets , and decorate the tombs of the righteous ,
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we wouldn 't have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . '
Jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way . his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
but he answered them , " You see all of these things , don 't you ? most certainly I tell you , there will not be left here one stone on another , that will not be thrown down . "
for many will come in my name , saying , ' I am the Christ , ' and will lead many astray .
for nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there will be famines , plagues , and earthquakes in various places .
then they will deliver you up to oppression , and will kill you . you will be hated by all of the nations for my name 's sake .
because iniquity will be multiplied , the love of many will grow cold .
but he who endures to the end , the same will be saved .
this Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations , and then the end will come .
" when , therefore , you see the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house .
for then there will be great oppression , such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now , no , nor ever will be .
unless those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved . but for the sake of the chosen ones , those days will be shortened .
" then if any man tells you , ' behold , here is the Christ , ' or , ' There , ' don 't believe it .
for there will arise false christs , and false prophets , and they will show great signs and wonders , so as to lead astray , if possible , even the chosen ones .
for as the lightning flashes from the east , and is seen even to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
but immediately after the oppression of those days , the sun will be darkened , the moon will not give its light , the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken ;
he will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from one end of the sky to the other .
" now from the fig tree learn this parable . when its branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near .
even so you also , when you see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
most certainly I tell you , this generation will not pass away , until all these things are accomplished .
" as the days of Noah were , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
for as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship ,
and they didn 't know until the flood came , and took them all away , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
then two men will be in the field : one will be taken and one will be left ;
two women grinding at the mill , one will be taken and one will be left .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
therefore also be ready , for in an hour that you don 't expect , the Son of Man will come .
" who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his lord has set over his household , to give them their food in due season ?
" then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins , who took their lamps , and went out to meet the bridegroom .
those who were foolish , when they took their lamps , took no oil with them ,
the foolish said to the wise , ' Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out . '
but the wise answered , saying , ' What if there isn 't enough for us and you ? you go rather to those who sell , and buy for yourselves . '
" for it is like a man , going into another country , who called his own servants , and entrusted his goods to them .
to one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one ; to each according to his own ability . then he went on his journey .
in the same way , he also who got the two gained another two .
but he who received the one went away and dug in the earth , and hid his lord 's money .
he who received the five talents came and brought another five talents , saying , ' Lord , you delivered to me five talents . behold , I have gained another five talents besides them . '
" he also who had received the one talent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you that you are a hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not scatter .
I was afraid , and went away and hid your talent in the earth . behold , you have what is yours . '
take away therefore the talent from him , and give it to him who has the ten talents .
for to everyone who has will be given , and he will have abundance , but from him who doesn 't have , even that which he has will be taken away .
" but when the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then he will sit on the throne of his glory .
before him all the nations will be gathered , and he will separate them one from another , as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
he will set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
I was naked , and you clothed me . I was sick , and you visited me . I was in prison , and you came to me . '
" then the righteous will answer him , saying , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry , and feed you ; or thirsty , and give you a drink ?
when did we see you as a stranger , and take you in ; or naked , and clothe you ?
" the King will answer them , ' Most certainly I tell you , inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers , you did it to me . '
then he will say also to those on the left hand , ' depart from me , you Cursed , into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels ;
" then they will also answer , saying , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry , or thirsty , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and didn 't help you ? '
then the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas .
they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit , and kill him .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her . "
now on the first day of unleavened bread , the disciples came to Jesus , saying to him , " Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover ? "
now when evening had come , he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples .
the Son of Man goes , even as it is written of him , but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
as they were eating , Jesus took bread , gave thanks for it , and broke it . he gave to the disciples , and said , " Take , eat ; this is my body . "
for this is my blood of the new Covenant , which is poured out for many for the remission of sins .
when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of olives .
watch and pray , that you don 't enter into temptation . the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
again , a second time he went away , and prayed , saying , " My Father , if this cup can 't pass away from me unless I drink it , your desire be done . "
he left them again , went away , and prayed a third time , saying the same words .
then he came to his disciples , and said to them , " Sleep on now , and take your rest . behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
behold , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
or do you think that I couldn 't ask my Father , and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels ?
in that hour Jesus said to the multitudes , " Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me ? I sat daily in the temple teaching , and you didn 't arrest me .
those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together .
but Peter followed him from a distance , to the court of the high priest , and entered in and sat with the officers , to see the end .
now the chief priests , the elders , and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus , that they might put him to death ;
but Jesus held his peace . the high priest answered him , " I adjure you by the living God , that you tell us whether you are the Christ , the Son of God . "
Jesus said to him , " You have said it . nevertheless , I tell you , after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming on the clouds of the sky . "
then the high priest tore his clothing , saying , " He has spoken blasphemy ! why do we need any more witnesses ? behold , now you have heard his blasphemy .
then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists , and some slapped him ,
when he had gone out onto the porch , someone else saw him , and said to those who were there , " This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth . "
after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter , " surely you are also one of them , for your speech makes you known . "
now when morning had come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
and they bound him , and led him away , and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate , the governor .
then Judas , who betrayed him , when he saw that Jesus was condemned , felt remorse , and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
he threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary , and departed . he went away and hanged himself .
the chief priests took the pieces of silver , and said , " It 's not lawful to put them into the treasury , since it is the price of blood . "
when he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner , whom they desired .
but the governor answered them , " Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? " they said , " Barabbas ! "
then the governor 's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium , and gathered the whole garrison together against him .
they spat on him , and took the Reed and struck him on the head .
when they had mocked him , they took the robe off of him , and put his clothes on him , and led him away to crucify him .
those who passed by blasphemed him , wagging their heads ,
he trusts in God . let God deliver him now , if he wants him ; for he said , ' I am the Son of God . ' "
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour .
some of them who stood there , when they heard it , said , " This man is calling Elijah . "
immediately one of them ran , and took a sponge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a Reed , and gave him a drink .
behold , the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom . the earth quaked and the rocks were split .
the tombs were opened , and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised ;
and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection , they entered into the holy city and appeared to many .
now the centurion , and those who were with him watching Jesus , when they saw the earthquake , and the things that were done , feared exceedingly , saying , " Truly this was the Son of God . "
among them were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
when evening had come , a rich man from Arimathaea , named Joseph , who himself was also Jesus ' disciple came .
Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
now after the Sabbath , as it began to dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb .
behold , there was a great earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky , and came and rolled away the stone from the door , and sat on it .
the angel answered the women , " Don 't be afraid , for I know that you seek Jesus , who has been crucified .
he is not here , for he has risen , just like he said . come , see the place where the Lord was lying .
go quickly and tell his disciples , ' He has risen from the dead , and behold , he goes before you into Galilee ; there you will see him . ' behold , I have told you . "
as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , " rejoice ! " they came and took hold of his feet , and worshiped him .
now while they were going , behold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief priests all the things that had happened .
so they took the money and did as they were told . this saying was spread abroad among the Jews , and continues until this day .
but the eleven disciples went into Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had sent them .
Jesus came to them and spoke to them , saying , " All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth .
teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you . behold , I am with you always , even to the end of the age . " Amen .
the beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
the voice of one crying in the wilderness , ' Make ready the way of the Lord ! make his paths straight ! ' "
all the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him . they were baptized by him in the Jordan river , confessing their sins .
he preached , saying , " After me comes he who is mightier than I , the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen .
it happened in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
immediately coming up from the water , he saw the heavens parting , and the Spirit descending on him like a dove .
he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan . he was with the wild animals ; and the angels were serving him .
now after John was taken into custody , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God ,
and saying , " The time is fulfilled , and the Kingdom of God is at hand ! repent , and believe in the Good News . "
passing along by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea , for they were fishermen .
going on a little further from there , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John , his brother , who were also in the boat mending the nets .
immediately he called them , and they left their father , Zebedee , in the boat with the hired servants , and went after him .
they went into Capernaum , and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught .
the unclean spirit , convulsing him and crying with a loud voice , came out of him .
the report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area .
immediately , when they had come out of the synagogue , they came into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
now Simon 's wife 's mother lay sick with a fever , and immediately they told him about her .
he came and took her by the hand , and raised her up . the fever left her , and she served them .
at evening , when the sun had set , they brought to him all who were sick , and those who were possessed by demons .
early in the morning , while it was still dark , he rose up and went out , and departed into a deserted place , and prayed there .
a leper came to him , begging him , kneeling down to him , and saying to him , " If you want to , you can make me clean . "
being moved with compassion , he stretched out his hand , and touched him , and said to him , " I want to . be made clean . "
when he had said this , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was made clean .
and said to him , " See you say nothing to anybody , but go show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
when he entered again into Capernaum after some days , it was heard that he was in the house .
immediately many were gathered together , so that there was no more room , not even around the door ; and he spoke the word to them .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the roof where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the Mat that the paralytic was lying on .
immediately Jesus , perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , said to them , " Why do you reason these things in your hearts ?
he arose , and immediately took up the Mat , and went out in front of them all ; so that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , " We never saw anything like this ! "
as he passed by , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus , sitting at the tax office , and he said to him , " Follow me . " and he arose and followed him .
it happened , that he was reclining at the table in his house , and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many , and they followed him .
the scribes and the Pharisees , when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors , said to his disciples , " Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners ? "
John 's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting , and they came and asked him , " Why do John 's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but your disciples don 't fast ? "
Jesus said to them , " Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can 't fast .
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then will they fast in that day .
no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old , and a worse hole is made .
it happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields , and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of grain .
he said to them , " did you never read what David did , when he had need , and was hungry--he , and those who were with him ?
how he entered into God 's house when Abiathar was high priest , and ate the show bread , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests , and gave also to those who were with him ? "
he entered again into the synagogue , and there was a man there who had his hand withered .
they watched him , whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day , that they might accuse him .
he spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd , so that they wouldn 't press on him .
for he had healed many , so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him .
the unclean spirits , whenever they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , " You are the Son of God ! "
he went up into the mountain , and called to himself those whom he wanted , and they went to him .
when his friends heard it , they went out to seize him : for they said , " He is insane . "
but no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder , unless he first binds the strong man ; and then he will plunder his house .
a multitude was sitting around him , and they told him , " behold , your mother , your brothers , and your sisters are outside looking for you . "
looking around at those who sat around him , he said , " behold , my mother and my brothers !
he taught them many things in parables , and told them in his teaching ,
and it happened , as he sowed , some seed fell by the road , and the birds came and devoured it .
others fell on the rocky ground , where it had little soil , and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil .
when the sun had risen , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
others fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
when he was alone , those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables .
he said to them , " To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God , but to those who are outside , all things are done in parables ,
that ' seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sins should be forgiven them . ' "
the ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown ; and when they have heard , immediately Satan comes , and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , some thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times . "
for there is nothing hidden , except that it should be made known ; neither was anything made secret , but that it should come to light .
if any man has ears to hear , let him hear . "
for whoever has , to him will more be given , and he who doesn 't have , even that which he has will be taken away from him . "
but when the fruit is ripe , immediately he puts forth the sickle , because the harvest has come . "
on that day , when evening had come , he said to them , " Let 's go over to the other side . "
leaving the multitude , they took him with them , even as he was , in the boat . other small boats were also with him .
he himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion , and they woke him up , and told him , " Teacher , don 't you care that we are dying ? "
he awoke , and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , " Peace ! be still ! " the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
they came to the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gadarenes .
when he had come out of the boat , immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs .
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him , and the fetters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to tame him .
always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
those who fed them fled , and told it in the city and in the country . the people came to see what it was that had happened .
they came to Jesus , and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting , clothed , and in his right mind , even him who had the Legion ; and they were afraid .
those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons , and about the pigs .
he went his way , and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him , and everyone marveled .
when Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side , a great multitude was gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
he went with him , and a great multitude followed him , and they pressed upon him on all sides .
and had suffered many things by many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was no better , but rather grew worse ,
immediately the flow of her blood was dried up , and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction .
but the woman , fearing and trembling , knowing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
but Jesus , when he heard the message spoken , immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue , " Don 't be afraid , only believe . "
they ridiculed him . but he , having put them all out , took the father of the child , her mother , and those who were with him , and went in where the child was lying .
he went out from there . he came into his own country , and his disciples followed him .
Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and among his own relatives , and in his own house . "
he could do no mighty work there , except that he laid his hands on a few sick people , and healed them .
he called to himself the twelve , and began to send them out two by two ; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
he commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , except a staff only : no bread , no wallet , no money in their purse ,
they cast out many demons , and anointed many with oil who were sick , and healed them .
but Herod , when he heard this , said , " This is John , whom I beheaded . he has risen from the dead . "
he swore to her , " Whatever you shall ask of me , I will give you , up to half of my kingdom . "
she came in immediately with haste to the king , and asked , " I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter . "
the king was exceedingly sorry , but for the sake of his oaths , and of his dinner guests , he didn 't wish to refuse her .
immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard , and commanded to bring John 's head , and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
and brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the young lady ; and the young lady gave it to her mother .
when his disciples heard this , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
the Apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus , and they told him all things , whatever they had done , and whatever they had taught .
he said to them , " You come apart into a deserted place , and rest awhile . " for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
they saw them going , and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities . they arrived before them and came together to him .
Jesus came out , saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd , and he began to teach them many things .
he commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass .
he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he blessed and broke the loaves , and he gave to his disciples to set before them , and he divided the two fish among them all .
they all ate , and were filled .
immediately he made his disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead to the other side , to Bethsaida , while he himself sent the multitude away .
after he had taken leave of them , he went up the mountain to pray .
but they , when they saw him walking on the sea , supposed that it was a ghost , and cried out ;
for they all saw him , and were troubled . but he immediately spoke with them , and said to them , " cheer up ! it is I ! Don 't be afraid . "
he got into the boat with them ; and the wind ceased , and they were very amazed among themselves , and marveled ;
when they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret , and moored to the shore .
when they had come out of the boat , immediately the people recognized him ,
and ran around that whole region , and began to bring those who were sick , on their Mats , to where they heard he was .
then the Pharisees , and some of the scribes gathered together to him , having come from Jerusalem .
now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled , that is , unwashed , hands , they found fault .
( for the Pharisees , and all the Jews , don 't eat unless they wash their hands and forearms , holding to the tradition of the elders .
the Pharisees and the scribes asked him , " Why don 't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with unwashed hands ? "
" for you set aside the commandment of God , and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups , and you do many other such things . "
for Moses said , ' honor your father and your mother ; ' and , ' He who speaks evil of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
there is nothing from outside of the man , that going into him can defile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man .
when he had entered into a house away from the multitude , his disciples asked him about the parable .
from there he arose , and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon . he entered into a house , and didn 't want anyone to know it , but he couldn 't escape notice .
for a woman , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having heard of him , came and fell down at his feet .
now the woman was a Greek , a Syrophoenician by race . she begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter .
but Jesus said to her , " Let the children be filled first , for it is not appropriate to take the children 's bread and throw it to the dogs . "
he said to her , " For this saying , go your way . the demon has gone out of your daughter . "
she went away to her house , and found the child having been laid on the bed , with the demon gone out .
again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and came to the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the region of Decapolis .
they brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech . they begged him to lay his hand on him .
he took him aside from the multitude , privately , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spat , and touched his tongue .
immediately his ears were opened , and the impediment of his tongue was released , and he spoke clearly .
if I send them away fasting to their home , they will faint on the way , for some of them have come a long way . "
he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground , and he took the seven loaves . having given thanks , he broke them , and gave them to his disciples to serve , and they served the multitude .
they ate , and were filled . they took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over .
the Pharisees came out and began to question him , seeking from him a sign from heaven , and testing him .
they forgot to take bread ; and they didn 't have more than one loaf in the boat with them .
" when the seven loaves fed the four thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? " they told him , " Seven . "
he sent him away to his house , saying , " Don 't enter into the village , nor tell anyone in the village . "
Jesus went out , with his disciples , into the villages of Caesarea Philippi . on the way he asked his disciples , " Who do men say that I am ? "
he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
he called the multitude to himself with his disciples , and said to them , " Whoever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever wants to save his life will lose it ; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it .
after six days Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
Peter answered Jesus , " Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . let 's make three tents : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
as they were coming down from the mountain , he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
but I tell you that Elijah has come , and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to , even as it is written about him . "
immediately all the multitude , when they saw him , were greatly amazed , and running to him greeted him .
they brought him to him , and when he saw him , immediately the spirit convulsed him , and he fell on the ground , wallowing and foaming at the mouth .
often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water , to destroy him . but if you can do anything , have compassion on us , and help us . "
when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to him , " You mute and deaf spirit , I command you , come out of him , and never enter him again ! "
but Jesus took him by the hand , and raised him up ; and he arose .
they went out from there , and passed through Galilee . he didn 't want anyone to know it .
he came to Capernaum , and when he was in the house he asked them , " What were you arguing among yourselves on the way ? "
but they were silent , for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest .
for whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because you are Christ 's , most certainly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck .
if your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life maimed , rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna , into the unquenchable fire ,
if your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life lame , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna , into the fire that will never be quenched--
if your eye causes you to stumble , cast it out . it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire ,
for everyone will be salted with fire , and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt .
salt is good , but if the salt has lost its saltiness , with what will you season it ? have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . "
he arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan . multitudes came together to him again . as he usually did , he was again teaching them .
but when Jesus saw it , he was moved with indignation , and said to them , " allow the little children to come to me ! Don 't forbid them , for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
most certainly I tell you , whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child , he will in no way enter into it . "
he took them in his arms , and blessed them , laying his hands on them .
as he was going out into the way , one ran to him , knelt before him , and asked him , " Good Teacher , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? "
but his face fell at that saying , and he went away sorrowful , for he was one who had great possessions .
Jesus looked around , and said to his disciples , " How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God ! "
the disciples were amazed at his words . but Jesus answered again , " Children , how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God !
it is easier for a Camel to go through a needle 's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came near to him , saying , " Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we will ask . "
they said to him , " Grant to us that we may sit , one at your right hand , and one at your left hand , in your glory . "
but Jesus said to them , " You don 't know what you are asking . are you able to drink the cup that I drink , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? "
when the ten heard it , they began to be indignant towards James and John .
Jesus summoned them , and said to them , " You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
but it shall not be so among you , but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant .
whoever of you wants to become first among you , shall be bondservant of all .
for the Son of Man also came not to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . "
when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene , he began to cry out , and say , " Jesus , you son of David , have mercy on me ! "
if anyone asks you , ' Why are you doing this ? ' say , ' The Lord needs him ; ' and immediately he will send him back here . "
they went away , and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street , and they untied him .
some of those who stood there asked them , " What are you doing , untying the young donkey ? "
they brought the young donkey to Jesus , and threw their garments on it , and Jesus sat on it .
many spread their garments on the way , and others were cutting down branches from the trees , and spreading them on the road .
those who went in front , and those who followed , cried out , " Hosanna ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem . when he had looked around at everything , it being now evening , he went out to Bethany with the twelve .
the next day , when they had come out from Bethany , he was hungry .
he taught , saying to them , " Isn 't it written , ' My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? ' but you have made it a den of robbers ! "
the chief priests and the scribes heard it , and sought how they might destroy him . for they feared him , because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching .
as they passed by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots .
therefore I tell you , all things whatever you pray and ask for , believe that you have received them , and you shall have them .
whenever you stand praying , forgive , if you have anything against anyone ; so that your Father , who is in heaven , may also forgive you your transgressions .
they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we should say , ' From heaven ; ' he will say , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
when it was time , he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard .
again , he sent another servant to them ; and they threw stones at him , wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully treated .
but those farmers said among themselves , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , and the inheritance will be ours . '
what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the farmers , and will give the vineyard to others .
they tried to seize him , but they feared the multitude ; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them . they left him , and went away .
Jesus answered them , " render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . " they marveled greatly at him .
and the seven took her and left no children . last of all the woman also died .
in the resurrection , when they rise , whose wife will she be of them ? for the seven had her as a wife . "
for when they will rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
he is not the God of the dead , but of the living . you are therefore badly mistaken . "
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first commandment .
the second is like this , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ' there is no other commandment greater than these . "
when Jesus saw that he answered wisely , he said to him , " You are not far from the Kingdom of God . " no one dared ask him any question after that .
for David himself said in the Holy Spirit , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet . " '
he called his disciples to himself , and said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury ,
Jesus said to him , " Do you see these great buildings ? there will not be left here one stone on another , which will not be thrown down . "
for many will come in my name , saying , ' I am he ! ' and will lead many astray .
" when you hear of wars and rumors of wars , don 't be troubled . for those must happen , but the end is not yet .
for nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . there will be earthquakes in various places . there will be famines and troubles . these things are the beginning of birth pains .
but watch yourselves , for they will deliver you up to councils . you will be beaten in synagogues . you will stand before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
you will be hated by all men for my name 's sake , but he who endures to the end , the same will be saved .
and let him who is on the housetop not go down , nor enter in , to take anything out of his house .
but woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days !
for in those days there will be oppression , such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will be .
unless the Lord had shortened the days , no flesh would have been saved ; but for the sake of the chosen ones , whom he picked out , he shortened the days .
then he will send out his angels , and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky .
" now from the fig tree , learn this parable . when the branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near ;
even so you also , when you see these things coming to pass , know that it is near , at the doors .
most certainly I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things happen .
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch .
watch therefore , for you don 't know when the lord of the house is coming , whether at evening , or at midnight , or when the rooster Crows , or in the morning ;
it was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread , and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception , and kill him .
for they said , " Not during the feast , because there might be a riot of the people . "
for you always have the poor with you , and whenever you want to , you can do them good ; but you will not always have me .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world , that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve , went away to the chief priests , that he might deliver him to them .
on the first day of unleavened bread , when they sacrificed the Passover , his disciples asked him , " Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover ? "
he sent two of his disciples , and said to them , " Go into the city , and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water . follow him ,
his disciples went out , and came into the city , and found things as he had said to them , and they prepared the Passover .
they began to be sorrowful , and to ask him one by one , " surely not I ? " and another said , " surely not I ? "
for the Son of Man goes , even as it is written about him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and when he had blessed , he broke it , and gave to them , and said , " Take , eat . this is my body . "
he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave to them . they all drank of it .
most certainly I tell you , I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God . "
when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of olives .
however , after I am raised up , I will go before you into Galilee . "
he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
he said , " ABBA , Father , all things are possible to you . please remove this cup from me . however , not what I desire , but what you desire . "
watch and pray , that you may not enter into temptation . the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
again he returned , and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy , and they didn 't know what to answer him .
immediately , while he was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve , came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs , from the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders .
now he who betrayed him had given them a sign , saying , " whomever I will kiss , that is he . seize him , and lead him away safely . "
when he had come , immediately he came to him , and said , " Rabbi ! rabbi ! " and kissed him .
but a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
a certain young man followed him , having a linen cloth thrown around himself , over his naked body . the young men grabbed him ,
they led Jesus away to the high priest . all the chief priests , the elders , and the scribes came together with him .
Peter had followed him from a distance , until he came into the court of the high priest . he was sitting with the officers , and warming himself in the light of the fire .
some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to beat him with fists , and to tell him , " Prophesy ! " the officers struck him with the palms of their hands .
Pilate again asked him , " Have you no answer ? see how many things they testify against you ! "
now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner , whom they asked of him .
there was one called Barabbas , bound with those who had made insurrection , men who in the insurrection had committed murder .
the multitude , crying aloud , began to ask him to do as he always did for them .
Pilate said to them , " Why , what evil has he done ? " but they cried out exceedingly , " Crucify him ! "
Pilate , wishing to please the multitude , released Barabbas to them , and handed over Jesus , when he had flogged him , to be crucified .
the soldiers led him away within the court , which is the Praetorium ; and they called together the whole cohort .
they clothed him with purple , and weaving a crown of thorns , they put it on him .
they struck his head with a Reed , and spat on him , and bowing their knees , did Homage to him .
when they had mocked him , they took the purple off of him , and put his own garments on him . they led him out to crucify him .
they compelled one passing by , coming from the country , Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to go with them , that he might bear his cross .
they brought him to the place called golgotha , which is , being interpreted , " The place of a skull . "
they offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink , but he didn 't take it .
the superscription of his accusation was written over him , " the King of the Jews . "
let the Christ , the King of Israel , now come down from the cross , that we may see and believe him . " those who were crucified with him insulted him .
when the sixth hour had come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
some of those who stood by , when they heard it , said , " behold , he is calling Elijah . "
one ran , and filling a sponge full of vinegar , put it on a Reed , and gave it to him to drink , saying , " Let him be . let 's see whether Elijah comes to take him down . "
when the centurion , who stood by opposite him , saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last , he said , " Truly this man was the Son of God ! "
there were also women watching from afar , among whom were both Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ;
very early on the first day of the week , they came to the tomb when the sun had risen .
for it was very big . looking up , they saw that the stone was rolled back .
entering into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , dressed in a white robe , and they were amazed .
they went out , and fled from the tomb , for trembling and astonishment had come on them . they said nothing to anyone ; for they were afraid .
now when he had risen early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons .
after these things he was revealed in another form to two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country .
afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table , and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they didn 't believe those who had seen him after he had risen .
he who believes and is baptized will be saved ; but he who disbelieves will be condemned .
so then the Lord , after he had spoken to them , was received up into heaven , and sat down at the right hand of God .
they went out , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word by the signs that followed . Amen .
but they had no child , because Elizabeth was barren , and they both were well advanced in years .
according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
but the angel said to him , " Don 't be afraid , Zacharias , because your request has been heard , and your wife , Elizabeth , will bear you a son , and you shall call his name John .
he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord , their God .
the angel answered him , " I am Gabriel , who stands in the presence of God . I was sent to speak to you , and to bring you this good news .
behold , you will be silent and not able to speak , until the day that these things will happen , because you didn 't believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their proper time . "
when he came out , he could not speak to them , and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple . he continued making signs to them , and remained mute .
it happened , when the days of his service were fulfilled , he departed to his house .
after these days Elizabeth , his wife , conceived , and she hid herself five months , saying ,
having come in , the angel said to her , " rejoice , you highly favored one ! the Lord is with you . blessed are you among women ! "
but when she saw him , she was greatly troubled at the saying , and considered what kind of salutation this might be .
behold , you will conceive in your womb , and bring forth a son , and will call his name ' Jesus . '
he will be great , and will be called the Son of the Most High . the Lord God will give him the throne of his father , David ,
behold , Elizabeth , your relative , also has conceived a son in her old age ; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren .
Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Judah ,
why am I so favored , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
for behold , when the voice of your greeting came into my ears , the baby leaped in my womb for joy !
blessed is she who believed , for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord ! "
Mary said , " My soul magnifies the Lord .
for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid . for behold , from now on , all generations will call me blessed .
he has shown strength with his arm . he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
he has put down princes from their thrones . and has exalted the lowly .
he has filled the hungry with good things . he has sent the rich away empty .
now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled , and she brought forth a son .
her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her , and they rejoiced with her .
it happened on the eighth day , that they came to circumcise the child ; and they would have called him Zacharias , after the name of the father .
fear came on all who lived around them , and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea .
all who heard them laid them up in their heart , saying , " What then will this child be ? " the hand of the Lord was with him .
his father , Zacharias , was filled with the Holy Spirit , and prophesied , saying ,
" blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , for he has visited and worked redemption for his people ;
the child was growing , and becoming strong in spirit , and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel .
now it happened in those days , that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled .
to enroll himself with Mary , who was pledged to be married to him as wife , being pregnant .
there were shepherds in the same country staying in the field , and keeping watch by night over their flock .
behold , an angel of the Lord stood by them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they were terrified .
this is the sign to you : you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth , lying in a feeding trough . "
they came with haste , and found both Mary and Joseph , and the baby was lying in the feeding trough .
when they saw it , they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child .
all who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds .
the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , just as it was told them .
when eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child , his name was called Jesus , which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled , they brought him up to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord
( as it is written in the law of the Lord , " Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord " ) ,
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , " A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons . "
behold , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon . this man was righteous and devout , looking for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was on him .
it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
for my eyes have seen your salvation ,
coming up at that very hour , she gave thanks to the Lord , and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem .
when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city , Nazareth .
the child was growing , and was becoming strong in spirit , being filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him .
when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast ,
when they didn 't find him , they returned to Jerusalem , looking for him .
it happened after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers , both listening to them , and asking them questions .
when they saw him , they were astonished , and his mother said to him , " Son , why have you treated us this way ? behold , your father and I were anxiously looking for you . "
and he went down with them , and came to Nazareth . he was subject to them , and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John , the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness .
as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , " The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ' Make ready the way of the Lord . make his paths straight .
every valley will be filled . every mountain and hill will be brought low . the crooked will become straight , and the rough ways smooth .
he said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him , " You offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and don 't begin to say among yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father ; ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones !
even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees . every tree therefore that doesn 't bring forth good fruit is cut down , and thrown into the fire . "
he answered them , " He who has two coats , let him give to him who has none . he who has food , let him do likewise . "
whose fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor , and will gather the wheat into his barn ; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire . "
Jesus himself , when he began to teach , was about thirty years old , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
the son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
the son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Joseph , the son of Judah ,
the son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmodam , the son of ER ,
the son of Jose , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
the son of Simeon , the son of Judah , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonan , the son of Eliakim ,
the son of Melea , the son of Menan , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
the son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of salmon , the son of Nahshon ,
the son of Amminadab , the son of Aram , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
the son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
the son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalaleel , the son of Cainan ,
the son of Enos , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
Jesus answered him , saying , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . ' "
the devil , leading him up on a high mountain , showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
the devil said to him , " I will give you all this authority , and their glory , for it has been delivered to me ; and I give it to whomever I want .
Jesus answered him , " Get behind me Satan ! for it is written , ' You shall worship the Lord your God , and you shall serve him only . ' "
he led him to Jerusalem , and set him on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , cast yourself down from here ,
and , ' On their hands they will bear you up , lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone . ' "
Jesus answering , said to him , " It has been said , ' You shall not tempt the Lord your God . ' "
Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee , and news about him spread through all the surrounding area .
he closed the book , gave it back to the attendant , and sat down . the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him .
all testified about him , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth , and they said , " Isn 't this Joseph 's son ? "
Elijah was sent to none of them , except to Zarephath , in the land of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , yet not one of them was cleansed , except Naaman , the Syrian . "
they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue , as they heard these things .
they rose up , threw him out of the city , and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on , that they might throw him off the cliff .
he came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee . he was teaching them on the Sabbath day ,
and they were astonished at his teaching , for his word was with authority .
he rose up from the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . Simon 's mother @-@ in @-@ law was afflicted with a great fever , and they begged him for her .
when the sun was setting , all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
when it was day , he departed and went into an uninhabited place , and the multitudes looked for him , and came to him , and held on to him , so that he wouldn 't go away from them .
but he said to them , " I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also . for this reason I have been sent . "
now it happened , while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God , that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret .
he saw two boats standing by the lake , but the fishermen had gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
when he had finished speaking , he said to Simon , " Put out into the deep , and let down your nets for a catch . "
when they had done this , they caught a great multitude of fish , and their net was breaking .
they beckoned to their partners in the other boat , that they should come and help them . they came , and filled both boats , so that they began to sink .
but Simon Peter , when he saw it , fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , " depart from me , for I am a sinful man , Lord . "
for he was amazed , and all who were with him , at the catch of fish which they had caught ;
and so also were James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . Jesus said to Simon , " Don 't be afraid . from now on you will be catching people alive . "
he commanded him to tell no one , " But go your way , and show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude , they went up to the housetop , and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus .
immediately he rose up before them , and took up that which he was laying on , and departed to his house , glorifying God .
he said to them , " Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
he also told a parable to them . " no one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment , or else he will tear the new , and also the piece from the new will not match the old .
no one puts new wine into old wineskins , or else the new wine will burst the skins , and it will be spilled , and the skins will be destroyed .
but new wine must be put into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved .
but some of the Pharisees said to them , " Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day ? "
Jesus , answering them , said , " haven 't you read what David did when he was hungry , he , and those who were with him ;
it also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught . there was a man there , and his right hand was withered .
the scribes and the Pharisees watched him , to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath , that they might find an accusation against him .
he looked around at them all , and said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " he did , and his hand was restored as sound as the other .
but they were filled with rage , and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus .
it happened in these days , that he went out to the mountain to pray , and he continued all night in prayer to God .
he lifted up his eyes to his disciples , and said , " blessed are you who are poor , for yours is the Kingdom of God .
blessed are you when men shall hate you , and when they shall exclude and mock you , and throw out your name as evil , for the Son of Man 's sake .
rejoice in that day , and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven , for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets .
to him who strikes you on the cheek , offer also the other ; and from him who takes away your cloak , don 't withhold your coat also .
give to everyone who asks you , and don 't ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again .
if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is that to you ? for even sinners do the same .
if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive , what credit is that to you ? even sinners lend to sinners , to receive back as much .
Don 't judge , and you won 't be judged . Don 't condemn , and you won 't be condemned . set free , and you will be set free .
a disciple is not above his teacher , but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher .
why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother 's eye , but don 't consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
for there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit ; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit .
for each tree is known by its own fruit . for people don 't gather figs from thorns , nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush .
everyone who comes to me , and hears my words , and does them , I will show you who he is like .
a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear to him , was sick and at the point of death .
those who were sent , returning to the house , found that the servant who had been sick was well .
it happened soon afterwards , that he went to a city called Nain . many of his disciples , along with a great multitude , went with him .
now when he drew near to the gate of the city , behold , one who was dead was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . many people of the city were with her .
when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said to her , " Don 't cry . "
he who was dead sat up , and began to speak . and he gave him to his mother .
this report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea , and in all the surrounding region .
when the men had come to him , they said , " John the Baptizer has sent us to you , saying , ' Are you he who comes , or should we look for another ? ' "
but what did you go out to see ? a man clothed in soft clothing ? behold , those who are gorgeously dressed , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
this is he of whom it is written , ' behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
" for I tell you , among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer , yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he . "
when all the people and the tax collectors heard this , they declared God to be just , having been baptized with John 's baptism .
they are like children who sit in the marketplace , and call one to another , saying , ' We piped to you , and you didn 't dance . we mourned , and you didn 't weep . '
for John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ' He has a demon . '
the Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ' behold , a gluttonous man , and a drunkard ; a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! '
one of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him . he entered into the Pharisee 's house , and sat at the table .
Jesus answered him , " Simon , I have something to tell you . " he said , " Teacher , say on . "
you gave me no kiss , but she , since the time I came in , has not ceased to kiss my feet .
it happened soon afterwards , that he went about through cities and villages , preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God . with him were the twelve ,
other seed fell on the rock , and as soon as it grew , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
those along the road are those who hear , then the devil comes , and takes away the word from their heart , that they may not believe and be saved .
that in the good ground , these are such as in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , hold it tightly , and bring forth fruit with patience .
for nothing is hidden , that will not be revealed ; nor anything secret , that will not be known and come to light .
be careful therefore how you hear . for whoever has , to him will be given ; and whoever doesn 't have , from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has . "
his mother and brothers came to him , and they could not come near him for the crowd .
but as they sailed , he fell asleep . a wind storm came down on the lake , and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water .
they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is opposite Galilee .
when Jesus stepped ashore , a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him . he wore no clothes , and didn 't live in a house , but in the tombs .
Jesus asked him , " What is your name ? " he said , " Legion , " for many demons had entered into him .
the demons came out from the man , and entered into the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake , and were drowned .
when those who fed them saw what had happened , they fled , and told it in the city and in the country .
those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed .
all the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them , for they were very much afraid . he entered into the boat , and returned .
it happened , when Jesus returned , that the multitude welcomed him , for they were all waiting for him .
behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue . he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and begged him to come into his house ,
for he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . but as he went , the multitudes pressed against him .
a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years , who had spent all her living on physicians , and could not be healed by any ,
came behind him , and touched the fringe of his cloak , and immediately the flow of her blood stopped .
when he came to the house , he didn 't allow anyone to enter in , except Peter , John , James , the father of the child , and her mother .
but he put them all outside , and taking her by the hand , he called , saying , " Child , arise ! "
he sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
as many as don 't receive you , when you depart from that city , shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them . "
the Apostles , when they had returned , told him what things they had done . he took them , and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida .
but the multitudes , perceiving it , followed him . he welcomed them , and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God , and he cured those who needed healing .
he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to the sky , he blessed them , and broke them , and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude .
they ate , and were all filled . they gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over .
he said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " The Christ of God . "
he said to all , " If anyone desires to come after me , let him deny himself , take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever desires to save his life will lose it , but whoever will lose his life for my sake , the same will save it .
for whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be ashamed , when he comes in his glory , and the glory of the Father , and of the holy angels .
but I tell you the truth : there are some of those who stand here , who will in no way taste of death , until they see the Kingdom of God . "
it happened about eight days after these sayings , that he took with him Peter , John , and James , and went up onto the mountain to pray .
as he was praying , the appearance of his face was altered , and his clothing became white and dazzling .
behold , two men were talking with him , who were Moses and Elijah ,
now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep , but when they were fully awake , they saw his glory , and the two men who stood with him .
while he said these things , a cloud came and overshadowed them , and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud .
when the voice came , Jesus was found alone . they were silent , and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen .
it happened on the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , that a great multitude met him .
behold , a man from the crowd called out , saying , " Teacher , I beg you to look at my son , for he is my only child .
while he was still coming , the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently . but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
but they didn 't understand this saying . it was concealed from them , that they should not perceive it , and they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
it came to pass , when the days were near that he should be taken up , he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
and sent messengers before his face . they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , so as to prepare for him .
they didn 't receive him , because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem .
when his disciples , James and John , saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky , and destroy them , just as Elijah did ? "
but he turned and rebuked them , " You don 't know of what kind of spirit you are .
for the Son of Man didn 't come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . " they went to another village .
as they went on the way , a certain man said to him , " I want to follow you wherever you go , Lord . "
Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
but Jesus said to him , " No one , having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , is fit for the Kingdom of God . "
now after these things , the Lord also appointed seventy others , and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place , where he was about to come .
then he said to them , " The harvest is indeed plentiful , but the laborers are few . pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest , that he may send out laborers into his harvest .
if a son of peace is there , your peace will rest on him ; but if not , it will return to you .
remain in that same house , eating and drinking the things they give , for the laborer is worthy of his wages . Don 't go from house to house .
into whatever city you enter , and they receive you , eat the things that are set before you .
heal the sick who are therein , and tell them , ' The Kingdom of God has come near to you . '
" Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
nevertheless , don 't rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . "
for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them , and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them . "
by chance a certain priest was going down that way . when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
in the same way a Levite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side .
but a certain Samaritan , as he traveled , came where he was . when he saw him , he was moved with compassion ,
it happened as they went on their way , he entered into a certain village , and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
she had a sister called Mary , who also sat at Jesus ' feet , and heard his word .
forgive us our sins , for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us . bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . ' "
" I tell you , keep asking , and it will be given you . keep seeking , and you will find . keep knocking , and it will be opened to you .
for everyone who asks receives . he who seeks finds . to him who knocks it will be opened .
or if he asks for an egg , he won 't give him a scorpion , will he ?
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ? "
he was casting out a demon , and it was mute . it happened , when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke ; and the multitudes marveled .
but he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation . a house divided against itself falls .
but if I by the finger of God cast out demons , then the Kingdom of God has come to you .
" he that is not with me is against me . he who doesn 't gather with me scatters .
the unclean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through dry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house from which I came out . '
then he goes , and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself , and they enter in and dwell there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . "
but he said , " On the contrary , blessed are those who hear the word of God , and keep it . "
for even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so will also the Son of Man be to this generation .
the men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation , and will condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , one greater than Jonah is here .
the lamp of the body is the eye . therefore when your eye is good , your whole body is also full of light ; but when it is evil , your body also is full of darkness .
if therefore your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wholly full of light , as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light . "
now as he spoke , a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him . he went in , and sat at the table .
when the Pharisee saw it , he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner .
but give for gifts to the needy those things which are within , and behold , all things will be clean to you .
Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you are like hidden graves , and the men who walk over them don 't know it . "
Woe to you ! for you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
Woe to you lawyers ! for you took away the key of knowledge . you didn 't enter in yourselves , and those who were entering in , you hindered . "
as he said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry , and to draw many things out of him ;
lying in wait for him , and seeking to catch him in something he might say , that they might accuse him .
but there is nothing covered up , that will not be revealed , nor hidden , that will not be known .
therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light . what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops .
" I tell you , my friends , don 't be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
but I will warn you whom you should fear . fear him , who after he has killed , has power to cast into Gehenna . yes , I tell you , fear him .
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered . therefore don 't be afraid . you are of more value than many sparrows .
but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God .
everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
he reasoned within himself , saying , ' What will I do , because I don 't have room to store my crops ? '
he said , ' This is what I will do . I will pull down my barns , and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
I will tell my soul , " Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years . take your ease , eat , drink , be merry . " '
which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height ?
if then you aren 't able to do even the least things , why are you anxious about the rest ?
but if this is how God clothes the grass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , O you of little faith ?
for the nations of the world seek after all of these things , but your Father knows that you need these things .
be like men watching for their lord , when he returns from the marriage feast ; that , when he comes and knocks , they may immediately open to him .
blessed are those servants , whom the lord will find watching when he comes . most certainly I tell you , that he will dress himself , and make them recline , and will come and serve them .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not allowed his house to be broken into .
therefore be ready also , for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don 't expect him . "
that servant , who knew his lord 's will , and didn 't prepare , nor do what he wanted , will be beaten with many stripes ,
do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth ? I tell you , no , but rather division .
for from now on , there will be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
when a south wind blows , you say , ' There will be a scorching heat , ' and it happens .
you hypocrites ! you know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky , but how is it that you don 't interpret this time ?
I tell you , you will by no means get out of there , until you have paid the very last penny . "
I tell you , no , but unless you repent , you will all perish in the same way .
or those Eighteen , on whom the tower in Siloam fell , and killed them ; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem ?
I tell you , no , but , unless you repent , you will all perish in the same way . "
if it bears fruit , fine ; but if not , after that , you can cut it down . ' "
behold , there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity Eighteen years , and she was bent over , and could in no way straighten herself up .
as he said these things , all his adversaries were disappointed , and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
he went on his way through cities and villages , teaching , and traveling on to Jerusalem .
they will come from the east , west , north , and south , and will sit down in the Kingdom of God .
behold , there are some who are last who will be first , and there are some who are first who will be last . "
on that same day , some Pharisees came , saying to him , " Get out of here , and go away , for Herod wants to kill you . "
nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day , for it can 't be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem . '
behold , your house is left to you desolate . I tell you , you will not see me , until you say , ' blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ' "
it happened , when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread , that they were watching him .
he answered them , " Which of you , if your son or an ox fell into a well , wouldn 't immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day ? "
for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . "
but when you make a feast , ask the poor , the maimed , the lame , or the blind ;
and you will be blessed , because they don 't have the resources to repay you . for you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous . "
when one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things , he said to him , " blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God ! "
he sent out his servant at Supper time to tell those who were invited , ' Come , for everything is ready now . '
" the lord said to the servant , ' Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
whoever doesn 't bear his own cross , and come after me , can 't be my disciple .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sends an envoy , and asks for conditions of peace .
so therefore whoever of you who doesn 't renounce all that he has , he can 't be my disciple .
it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile . it is thrown out . he who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
when he has found it , he carries it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
or what woman , if she had ten drachma coins , if she lost one drachma coin , wouldn 't light a lamp , sweep the house , and seek diligently until she found it ?
when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ' rejoice with me , for I have found the drachma which I had lost . '
he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country , and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs .
but when he came to himself he said , ' How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough to spare , and I 'm dying with hunger !
I will get up and go to my father , and will tell him , " Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in your sight .
the son said to him , ' Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in your sight . I am no longer worthy to be called your son . '
bring the fattened calf , kill it , and let us eat , and celebrate ;
for this , my son , was dead , and is alive again . he was lost , and is found . ' they began to celebrate .
" now his elder son was in the field . as he came near to the house , he heard music and dancing .
he said to him , ' Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fattened calf , because he has received him back safe and healthy . '
but when this , your son , came , who has devoured your living with prostitutes , you killed the fattened calf for him . '
but it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad , for this , your brother , was dead , and is alive again . he was lost , and is found . ' "
I know what I will do , so that when I am removed from management , they may receive me into their houses . '
if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
if you have not been faithful in that which is another 's , who will give you that which is your own ?
the Pharisees , who were lovers of money , also heard all these things , and they scoffed at him .
the law and the prophets were until John . from that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached , and everyone is forcing his way into it .
but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall .
it happened that the beggar died , and that he was carried away by the angels to Abraham 's bosom . the rich man also died , and was buried .
in Hades , he lifted up his eyes , being in torment , and saw Abraham far off , and Lazarus at his bosom .
for I have five brothers , that he may testify to them , so they won 't also come into this place of torment . '
" he said to him , ' If they don 't listen to Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead . ' "
it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble .
the Lord said , " If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed , you would tell this sycamore tree , ' Be uprooted , and be planted in the sea , ' and it would obey you .
but who is there among you , having a servant plowing or keeping sheep , that will say , when he comes in from the field , ' Come immediately and sit down at the table , '
and will not rather tell him , ' Prepare my Supper , clothe yourself properly , and serve me , while I eat and drink . afterward you shall eat and drink ' ?
does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded ? I think not .
even so you also , when you have done all the things that are commanded you , say , ' We are unworthy servants . we have done our duty . ' "
it happened as he was on his way to Jerusalem , that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee .
when he saw them , he said to them , " Go and show yourselves to the priests . " it happened that as they went , they were cleansed .
neither will they say , ' Look , here ! ' or , ' Look , there ! ' for behold , the Kingdom of God is within you . "
he said to the disciples , " The days will come , when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
for as the lightning , when it flashes out of the one part under the sky , shines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
as it happened in the days of Noah , even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man .
they ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise , even as it happened in the days of lot : they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ;
but in the day that lot went out from Sodom , it rained fire and sulfur from the sky , and destroyed them all .
it will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed .
I tell you , in that night there will be two people in one bed . the one will be taken , and the other will be left .
there will be two grinding grain together . one will be taken , and the other will be left . "
won 't God avenge his chosen ones , who are crying out to him day and night , and yet he exercises patience with them ?
I tell you that he will avenge them quickly . nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on the earth ? "
but the tax collector , standing far away , wouldn 't even lift up his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ' God , be merciful to me , a sinner ! '
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be exalted . "
they were also bringing their babies to him , that he might touch them . but when the disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
most certainly , I tell you , whoever doesn 't receive the Kingdom of God like a little child , he will in no way enter into it . "
you know the commandments : ' Don 't commit adultery , ' ' Don 't murder , ' ' Don 't steal , ' ' Don 't give false testimony , ' ' honor your father and your mother . ' "
Jesus , seeing that he became very sad , said , " How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God !
for it is easier for a Camel to enter in through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
he took the twelve aside , and said to them , " behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
they understood none of these things . this saying was hidden from them , and they didn 't understand the things that were said .
it happened , as he came near Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the road , begging .
those who led the way rebuked him , that he should be quiet ; but he cried out all the more , " You son of David , have mercy on me ! "
there was a man named Zacchaeus . he was a chief tax collector , and he was rich .
he was trying to see who Jesus was , and couldn 't because of the crowd , because he was short .
he ran on ahead , and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him , for he was to pass that way .
when Jesus came to the place , he looked up and saw him , and said to him , " Zacchaeus , hurry and come down , for today I must stay at your house . "
when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , " He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner . "
for the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost . "
as they heard these things , he went on and told a parable , because he was near Jerusalem , and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately .
he called ten servants of his , and gave them ten Mina coins , and told them , ' Conduct business until I come . '
for I feared you , because you are an exacting man . you take up that which you didn 't lay down , and reap that which you didn 't sow . '
then why didn 't you deposit my money in the bank , and at my coming , I might have earned interest on it ? '
he said to those who stood by , ' Take the Mina away from him , and give it to him who has the ten minas . '
'For I tell you that to everyone who has , will more be given ; but from him who doesn 't have , even that which he has will be taken away from him .
as they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , " Why are you untying the colt ? "
they brought it to Jesus . they threw their cloaks on the colt , and set Jesus on them .
saying , " blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! peace in heaven , and glory in the highest ! "
when he drew near , he saw the city and wept over it ,
saying , " If you , even you , had known today the things which belong to your peace ! but now , they are hidden from your eyes .
for the days will come on you , when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you , surround you , hem you in on every side ,
and will dash you and your children within you to the ground . they will not leave in you one stone on another , because you didn 't know the time of your visitation . "
he entered into the temple , and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it ,
saying to them , " It is written , ' My house is a house of prayer , ' but you have made it a ' den of robbers ' ! "
he answered them , " I also will ask you one question . tell me :
they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will say , ' Why didn 't you believe him ? '
but if we say , ' From men , ' all the people will stone us , for they are persuaded that John was a prophet . "
he began to tell the people this parable . " a man planted a vineyard , and rented it out to some farmers , and went into another country for a long time .
at the proper season , he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard . but the farmers beat him , and sent him away empty .
he sent yet a third , and they also wounded him , and threw him out .
" but when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . '
they threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them ?
he will come and destroy these farmers , and will give the vineyard to others . " when they heard it , they said , " May it never be ! "
the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour , but they feared the people--for they knew he had spoken this parable against them .
but he perceived their craftiness , and said to them , " Why do you test me ?
he said to them , " Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . "
they weren 't able to trap him in his words before the people . they marveled at his answer , and were silent .
but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage .
for they can 't die any more , for they are like the angels , and are children of God , being children of the resurrection .
but that the dead are raised , even Moses showed at the bush , when he called the Lord ' The God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . '
now he is not the God of the dead , but of the living , for all are alive to him . "
some of the scribes answered , " Teacher , you speak well . "
for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance , but she , out of her poverty , put in all that she had to live on . "
when you hear of wars and disturbances , don 't be terrified , for these things must happen first , but the end won 't come immediately . "
there will be great earthquakes , famines , and plagues in various places . there will be terrors and great signs from heaven .
but before all these things , they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you , delivering you up to synagogues and prisons , bringing you before kings and governors for my name 's sake .
you will be handed over even by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends . they will cause some of you to be put to death .
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . let those who are in the midst of her depart . let those who are in the country not enter therein .
for these are days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days ! for there will be great distress in the land , and wrath to this people .
men fainting for fear , and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world : for the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
but when these things begin to happen , look up , and lift up your heads , because your redemption is near . "
when they are already budding , you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near .
even so you also , when you see these things happening , know that the Kingdom of God is near .
every day Jesus was teaching in the temple , and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet .
now the feast of unleavened bread , which is called the Passover , drew near .
the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death , for they feared the people .
he went away , and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them .
the day of unleavened bread came , on which the Passover must be sacrificed .
for I tell you , I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God . "
he received a cup , and when he had given thanks , he said , " Take this , and share it among yourselves ,
for I tell you , I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine , until the Kingdom of God comes . "
he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and gave to them , saying , " This is my body which is given for you . do this in memory of me . "
likewise , he took the cup after Supper , saying , " This cup is the new Covenant in my blood , which is poured out for you .
the Son of Man indeed goes , as it has been determined , but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed ! "
they began to question among themselves , which of them it was who would do this thing .
but not so with you . but one who is the greater among you , let him become as the younger , and one who is governing , as one who serves .
for who is greater , one who sits at the table , or one who serves ? Isn 't it he who sits at the table ? but I am in the midst of you as one who serves .
that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom . you will sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . "
the Lord said , " Simon , Simon , behold , Satan asked to have you , that he might sift you as wheat ,
but I prayed for you , that your faith wouldn 't fail . you , when once you have turned again , establish your brothers . "
then he said to them , " But now , whoever has a purse , let him take it , and likewise a wallet . whoever has none , let him sell his cloak , and buy a sword .
he came out , and went , as his custom was , to the Mount of olives . his disciples also followed him .
when he was at the place , he said to them , " pray that you don 't enter into temptation . "
when he rose up from his prayer , he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping because of grief ,
when those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said to him , " Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? "
a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
Jesus said to the chief priests , captains of the temple , and elders , who had come against him , " Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs ?
when I was with you in the temple daily , you didn 't stretch out your hands against me . but this is your hour , and the power of darkness . "
they seized him , and led him away , and brought him into the high priest 's house . but Peter followed from a distance .
when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard , and had sat down together , Peter sat among them .
a certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light , and looking intently at him , said , " This man also was with him . "
having blindfolded him , they struck him on the face and asked him , " Prophesy ! who is the one who struck you ? "
as soon as it was day , the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together , both chief priests and scribes , and they led him away into their council , saying ,
and if I ask , you will in no way answer me or let me go .
from now on , the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God . "
Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes , " I find no basis for a charge against this man . "
when he found out that he was in Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who was also in Jerusalem during those days .
Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day , for before that they were enemies with each other .
he released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder , for whom they asked , but he delivered Jesus up to their will .
when they led him away , they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene , coming from the country , and laid on him the cross , to carry it after Jesus .
for behold , the days are coming in which they will say , ' blessed are the barren , the wombs that never bore , and the breasts that never nursed . '
for if they do these things in the green tree , what will be done in the dry ? "
there were also others , two criminals , led with him to be put to death .
when they came to the place that is called The skull , they crucified him there with the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
the people stood watching . the rulers with them also scoffed at him , saying , " He saved others . let him save himself , if this is the Christ of God , his chosen one ! "
the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him and offering him vinegar ,
an inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and Hebrew : " this IS the King of the Jews . "
but the other answered , and rebuking him said , " Don 't you even fear God , seeing you are under the same condemnation ?
all the multitudes that came together to see this , when they saw the things that were done , returned home beating their breasts .
all his acquaintances , and the women who followed with him from Galilee , stood at a distance , watching these things .
behold , a man named Joseph , who was a member of the council , a good and righteous man
( he had not consented to their counsel and deed ) , from Arimathaea , a city of the Jews , who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God :
this man went to Pilate , and asked for Jesus ' body .
he took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no one had ever been laid .
it was the day of the Preparation , and the Sabbath was drawing near .
the women , who had come with him out of Galilee , followed after , and saw the tomb , and how his body was laid .
but on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they and some others came to the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared .
they entered in , and didn 't find the Lord Jesus ' body .
he isn 't here , but is risen . remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee ,
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again ? "
returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
now they were Mary Magdalene , Joanna , and Mary the mother of James . the other women with them told these things to the Apostles .
but Peter got up and ran to the tomb . Stooping and looking in , he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves , and he departed to his home , wondering what had happened .
they talked with each other about all of these things which had happened .
it happened , while they talked and questioned together , that Jesus himself came near , and went with them .
it happened , that when he had sat down at the table with them , he took the bread and gave thanks . breaking it , he gave to them .
they said one to another , " Weren 't our hearts burning within us , while he spoke to us along the way , and while he opened the Scriptures to us ? "
they rose up that very hour , returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and those who were with them ,
they related the things that happened along the way , and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread .
but they were terrified and filled with fear , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb .
behold , I send forth the promise of my Father on you . but wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high . "
it happened , while he blessed them , that he withdrew from them , and was carried up into heaven .
in the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
in him was life , and the life was the light of men .
the light shines in the darkness , and the darkness hasn 't overcome it .
the same came as a witness , that he might testify about the light , that all might believe through him .
he was not the light , but was sent that he might testify about the light .
he was in the world , and the world was made through him , and the world didn 't recognize him .
he came to his own , and those who were his own didn 't receive him .
but as many as received him , to them he gave the right to become God 's children , to those who believe in his name :
who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
the Word became flesh , and lived among us . we saw his glory , such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father , full of grace and truth .
no one has seen God at any time . the one and only Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he has declared him .
he said , " I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , ' Make straight the way of the Lord , ' as Isaiah the prophet said . "
he is the one who comes after me , who is preferred before me , whose sandal strap I 'm not worthy to loosen . "
the next day , he saw Jesus coming to him , and said , " behold , the lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
I didn 't know him , but for this reason I came baptizing in water : that he would be revealed to Israel . "
John testified , saying , " I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven , and it remained on him .
again , the next day , John was standing with two of his disciples ,
and he looked at Jesus as he walked , and said , " behold , the lamb of God ! "
one of the two who heard John , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother .
he first found his own brother , Simon , and said to him , " We have found the Messiah ! " ( which is , being interpreted , Christ ) .
he brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him , and said , " You are Simon the son of Jonah . you shall be called Cephas " ( which is by interpretation , Peter ) .
on the next day , he was determined to go out into Galilee , and he found Philip . Jesus said to him , " Follow me . "
Philip found Nathanael , and said to him , " We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , wrote : Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . "
Nathanael said to him , " How do you know me ? " Jesus answered him , " Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . "
Jesus answered him , " Because I told you , ' I saw you underneath the fig tree , ' do you believe ? you will see greater things than these ! "
he said to him , " Most certainly , I tell you , hereafter you will see heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man . "
Jesus also was invited , with his disciples , to the marriage .
when the wine ran out , Jesus ' mother said to him , " They have no wine . "
now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews ' way of purifying , containing two or three metretes apiece .
he said to them , " Now draw some out , and take it to the ruler of the feast . " so they took it .
after this , he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , his brothers , and his disciples ; and they stayed there a few days .
he made a whip of cords , and threw all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen ; and he poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew their tables .
to those who sold the doves , he said , " Take these things out of here ! Don 't make my Father 's house a marketplace ! "
when therefore he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he said this , and they believed the Scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover , during the feast , many believed in his name , observing his signs which he did .
Jesus answered him , " Most certainly , I tell you , unless one is born anew , he can 't see the Kingdom of God . "
Nicodemus said to him , " How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ? "
Jesus answered , " Most certainly I tell you , unless one is born of water and spirit , he can 't enter into the Kingdom of God !
that which is born of the flesh is flesh . that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
most certainly I tell you , we speak that which we know , and testify of that which we have seen , and you don 't receive our witness .
if I told you earthly things and you don 't believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
no one has ascended into heaven , but he who descended out of heaven , the Son of Man , who is in heaven .
as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
for God didn 't send his Son into the world to judge the world , but that the world should be saved through him .
he who believes in him is not judged . he who doesn 't believe has been judged already , because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God .
this is the judgment , that the light has come into the world , and men loved the darkness rather than the light ; for their works were evil .
for everyone who does evil hates the light , and doesn 't come to the light , lest his works would be exposed .
but he who does the truth comes to the light , that his works may be revealed , that they have been done in God . "
after these things , Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea . he stayed there with them , and baptized .
you yourselves testify that I said , ' I am not the Christ , ' but , ' I have been sent before him . '
he who comes from above is above all . he who is from the earth belongs to the earth , and speaks of the earth . he who comes from heaven is above all .
he who has received his witness has set his seal to this , that God is true .
for he whom God has sent speaks the words of God ; for God gives the Spirit without measure .
so he came to a city of Samaria , called Sychar , near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son , Joseph .
Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being tired from his journey , sat down by the well . it was about the sixth hour .
the Samaritan woman therefore said to him , " How is it that you , being a Jew , ask for a drink from me , a Samaritan woman ? " ( for Jews have no dealings with Samaritans . )
are you greater than our father , Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank of it himself , as did his children , and his livestock ? "
for you have had five husbands ; and he whom you now have is not your husband . this you have said truly . "
our fathers worshiped in this mountain , and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship . "
you worship that which you don 't know . we worship that which we know ; for salvation is from the Jews .
but the hour comes , and now is , when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers .
the woman said to him , " I know that Messiah comes , " ( he who is called Christ ) . " when he has come , he will declare to us all things . "
he who reaps receives wages , and gathers fruit to eternal life ; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together .
from that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman , who testified , " He told me everything that I did . "
so when the Samaritans came to him , they begged him to stay with them . he stayed there two days .
they said to the woman , " Now we believe , not because of your speaking ; for we have heard for ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Savior of the world . "
so when he came into Galilee , the Galileans received him , having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast , for they also went to the feast .
Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee , where he made the water into wine . there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum .
when he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee , he went to him , and begged him that he would come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your son lives . " the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he went his way .
as he was now going down , his servants met him and reported , saying " Your child lives ! "
so he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better . they said therefore to him , " Yesterday at the seventh hour , the fever left him . "
after these things , there was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate , there is a pool , which is called in Hebrew , " Bethesda , " having five porches .
in these lay a great multitude of those who were sick , blind , lame , or paralyzed , waiting for the moving of the water ;
a certain man was there , who had been sick for thirty @-@ eight years .
when Jesus saw him lying there , and knew that he had been sick for a long time , he asked him , " Do you want to be made well ? "
immediately , the man was made well , and took up his Mat and walked . now it was the Sabbath on that day .
then they asked him , " Who is the man who said to you , ' Take up your Mat , and walk ' ? "
but he who was healed didn 't know who it was , for Jesus had withdrawn , a crowd being in the place .
afterward Jesus found him in the temple , and said to him , " behold , you are made well . sin no more , so that nothing worse happens to you . "
the man went away , and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus , and sought to kill him , because he did these things on the Sabbath .
Jesus therefore answered them , " Most certainly , I tell you , the Son can do nothing of himself , but what he sees the Father doing . for whatever things he does , these the Son also does likewise .
for the Father has affection for the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does . he will show him greater works than these , that you may marvel .
for as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires .
for the Father judges no one , but he has given all judgment to the Son ,
that all may honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . he who doesn 't honor the Son doesn 't honor the Father who sent him .
" most certainly I tell you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has eternal life , and doesn 't come into judgment , but has passed out of death into life .
most certainly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God 's voice ; and those who hear will live .
for as the Father has life in himself , even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself .
he also gave him authority to execute judgment , because he is a son of man .
Don 't marvel at this , for the hour comes , in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice ,
and will come out ; those who have done good , to the resurrection of life ; and those who have done evil , to the resurrection of judgment .
but the testimony which I receive is not from man . however , I say these things that you may be saved .
the Father himself , who sent me , has testified about me . you have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his form .
you don 't have his word living in you ; because you don 't believe him whom he sent .
" you search the Scriptures , because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and these are they which testify about me .
I have come in my Father 's name , and you don 't receive me . if another comes in his own name , you will receive him .
how can you believe , who receive glory from one another , and you don 't seek the glory that comes from the only God ?
" Don 't think that I will accuse you to the Father . there is one who accuses you , even Moses , on whom you have set your hope .
after these things , Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee , which is also called the Sea of Tiberias .
a great multitude followed him , because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick .
Jesus went up into the mountain , and he sat there with his disciples .
now the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was at hand .
Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes , and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him , said to Philip , " Where are we to buy bread , that these may eat ? "
Jesus said , " Have the people sit down . " now there was much grass in that place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
when they were filled , he said to his disciples , " Gather up the broken pieces which are left over , that nothing be lost . "
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which were left over by those who had eaten .
when therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did , they said , " This is truly the prophet who comes into the world . "
Jesus therefore , perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
when evening came , his disciples went down to the sea ,
and they entered into the boat , and were going over the sea to Capernaum . it was now dark , and Jesus had not come to them .
when therefore they had rowed about twenty @-@ five or thirty stadia , they saw Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
they were willing therefore to receive him into the boat . immediately the boat was at the land where they were going .
however boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn 't there , nor his disciples , they themselves got into the boats , and came to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
Jesus answered them , " Most certainly I tell you , you seek me , not because you saw signs , but because you ate of the loaves , and were filled .
for the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven , and gives life to the world . "
Jesus said to them , " I am the bread of life . he who comes to me will not be hungry , and he who believes in me will never be thirsty .
all those whom the Father gives me will come to me . he who comes to me I will in no way throw out .
for I have come down from heaven , not to do my own will , but the will of him who sent me .
this is the will of my Father who sent me , that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing , but should raise him up at the last day .
the Jews therefore murmured concerning him , because he said , " I am the bread which came down out of heaven . "
not that anyone has seen the Father , except he who is from God . he has seen the Father .
this is the bread which comes down out of heaven , that anyone may eat of it and not die .
I am the living bread which came down out of heaven . if anyone eats of this bread , he will live forever . yes , the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh . "
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you don 't have life in yourselves .
he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up at the last day .
he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me , and I in him .
as the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father ; so he who feeds on me , he will also live because of me .
therefore many of his disciples , when they heard this , said , " This is a hard saying ! who can listen to it ? "
but Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this , said to them , " Does this cause you to stumble ?
it is the spirit who gives life . the flesh profits nothing . the words that I speak to you are spirit , and are life .
but there are some of you who don 't believe . " for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn 't believe , and who it was who would betray him .
he said , " For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me , unless it is given to him by my Father . "
we have come to believe and know that you are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
after these things , Jesus was walking in Galilee , for he wouldn 't walk in Judea , because the Jews sought to kill him .
now the feast of the Jews , the Feast of booths , was at hand .
for no one does anything in secret , and himself seeks to be known openly . if you do these things , reveal yourself to the world . "
the world can 't hate you , but it hates me , because I testify about it , that its works are evil .
you go up to the feast . I am not yet going up to this feast , because my time is not yet fulfilled . "
but when his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
but when it was now the midst of the feast , Jesus went up into the temple and taught .
if anyone desires to do his will , he will know about the teaching , whether it is from God , or if I am speaking from myself .
he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory , but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
Moses has given you circumcision ( not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers ) , and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy .
if a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be broken , are you angry with me , because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath ?
they sought therefore to take him ; but no one laid a hand on him , because his hour had not yet come .
but of the multitude , many believed in him . they said , " When the Christ comes , he won 't do more signs than those which this man has done , will he ? "
the Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him , and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him .
you will seek me , and won 't find me ; and where I am , you can 't come . "
what is this word that he said , ' You will seek me , and won 't find me ; and where I am , you can 't come ' ? "
now on the last and greatest day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , " If anyone is thirsty , let him come to me and drink !
but he said this about the Spirit , which those believing in him were to receive . for the Holy Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus wasn 't yet glorified .
many of the multitude therefore , when they heard these words , said , " This is truly the prophet . "
the officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , " Why didn 't you bring him ? "
now very early in the morning , he came again into the temple , and all the people came to him . he sat down , and taught them .
they said this testing him , that they might have something to accuse him of . but Jesus stooped down , and wrote on the ground with his finger .
but when they continued asking him , he looked up and said to them , " He who is without sin among you , let him throw the first stone at her . "
again he stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground .
even if I do judge , my judgment is true , for I am not alone , but I am with the Father who sent me .
Jesus spoke these words in the treasury , as he taught in the temple . yet no one arrested him , because his hour had not yet come .
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . however he who sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these I say to the world . "
he who sent me is with me . the Father hasn 't left me alone , for I always do the things that are pleasing to him . "
I know that you are Abraham 's seed , yet you seek to kill me , because my word finds no place in you .
I say the things which I have seen with my Father ; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father . "
they answered him , " Our father is Abraham . " Jesus said to them , " If you were Abraham 's children , you would do the works of Abraham .
but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . Abraham didn 't do this .
you do the works of your father . " they said to him , " We were not born of sexual immorality . we have one Father , God . "
therefore Jesus said to them , " If God were your father , you would love me , for I came out and have come from God . for I haven 't come of myself , but he sent me .
which of you convicts me of sin ? if I tell the truth , why do you not believe me ?
he who is of God hears the words of God . for this cause you don 't hear , because you are not of God . "
most certainly , I tell you , if a person keeps my word , he will never see death . "
Jesus answered , " If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . it is my Father who glorifies me , of whom you say that he is our God .
therefore they took up stones to throw at him , but Jesus was hidden , and went out of the temple , having gone through their midst , and so passed by .
I must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day . the night is coming , when no one can work .
when he had said this , he spat on the ground , made mud with the saliva , anointed the blind man 's eyes with the mud ,
and said to him , " Go , wash in the pool of Siloam " ( which means " sent " ) . so he went away , washed , and came back seeing .
the neighbors therefore , and those who saw that he was blind before , said , " Isn 't this he who sat and begged ? "
again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight . he said to them , " He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and I see . "
the Jews therefore did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of him who had received his sight ,
but how he now sees , we don 't know ; or who opened his eyes , we don 't know . he is of age . ask him . he will speak for himself . "
his parents said these things because they feared the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ , he would be put out of the synagogue .
he answered them , " I told you already , and you didn 't listen . why do you want to hear it again ? you don 't also want to become his disciples , do you ? "
we know that God has spoken to Moses . but as for this man , we don 't know where he comes from . "
we know that God doesn 't listen to sinners , but if anyone is a worshipper of God , and does his will , he listens to him .
since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind .
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , and finding him , he said , " Do you believe in the Son of God ? "
Jesus said , " I came into this world for judgment , that those who don 't see may see ; and that those who see may become blind . "
" most certainly , I tell you , one who doesn 't enter by the door into the sheep fold , but climbs up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
but one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
the gatekeeper opens the gate for him , and the sheep listen to his voice . he calls his own sheep by name , and leads them out .
whenever he brings out his own sheep , he goes before them , and the sheep follow him , for they know his voice .
they will by no means follow a stranger , but will flee from him ; for they don 't know the voice of strangers . "
all who came before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep didn 't listen to them .
I am the door . if anyone enters in by me , he will be saved , and will go in and go out , and will find pasture .
I am the good shepherd . the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
the hired hand flees because he is a hired hand , and doesn 't care for the sheep .
I am the good shepherd . I know my own , and I 'm known by my own ;
I have other sheep , which are not of this fold . I must bring them also , and they will hear my voice . they will become one flock with one shepherd .
therefore the Father loves me , because I lay down my life , that I may take it again .
no one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
it was winter , and Jesus was walking in the temple , in Solomon 's porch .
Jesus answered them , " I told you , and you don 't believe . the works that I do in my Father 's name , these testify about me .
but you don 't believe , because you are not of my sheep , as I told you .
I give eternal life to them . they will never perish , and no one will snatch them out of my hand .
my Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all . no one is able to snatch them out of my Father 's hand .
if he called them gods , to whom the word of God came ( and the Scripture can 't be broken ) ,
do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ' You blaspheme , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ? '
if I don 't do the works of my Father , don 't believe me .
he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first , and there he stayed .
now a certain man was sick , Lazarus from Bethany , of the village of Mary and her sister , Martha .
it was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother , Lazarus , was sick .
the sisters therefore sent to him , saying , " Lord , behold , he for whom you have great affection is sick . "
Jesus answered , " Aren 't there twelve hours of daylight ? if a man walks in the day , he doesn 't stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
but if a man walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light isn 't in him . "
now Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep .
I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , so that you may believe . nevertheless , let 's go to him . "
so when Jesus came , he found that he had been in the tomb four days already .
many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary , to console them concerning their brother .
then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went and met him , but Mary stayed in the house .
when she had said this , she went away , and called Mary , her sister , secretly , saying , " The Teacher is here , and is calling you . "
now Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was in the place where Martha met him .
therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wouldn 't have died . "
when Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
some of them said , " Couldn 't this man , who opened the eyes of him who was blind , have also kept this man from dying ? "
Jesus therefore , again groaning in himself , came to the tomb . now it was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
Jesus said , " Take away the stone . " Martha , the sister of him who was dead , said to him , " Lord , by this time there is a stench , for he has been dead four days . "
so they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying . Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , " Father , I thank you that you listened to me .
I know that you always listen to me , but because of the multitude that stands around I said this , that they may believe that you sent me . "
he who was dead came out , bound hand and foot with wrappings , and his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus said to them , " Free him , and let him go . "
but some of them went away to the Pharisees , and told them the things which Jesus had done .
if we leave him alone like this , everyone will believe in him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . "
but a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being high priest that year , said to them , " You know nothing at all ,
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews , but departed from there into the country near the wilderness , to a city called Ephraim . he stayed there with his disciples .
now the Passover of the Jews was at hand . many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover , to purify themselves .
then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another , as they stood in the temple , " What do you think--that he isn 't coming to the feast at all ? "
now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was , he should report it , that they might seize him .
then six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
so they made him a Supper there . Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him .
Mary , therefore , took a pound of ointment of pure Nard , very precious , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair . the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment .
now he said this , not because he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and having the money box , used to steal what was put into it .
because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus .
on the next day a great multitude had come to the feast . when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
his disciples didn 't understand these things at first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written about him , and that they had done these things to him .
the multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , was testifying about it .
for this cause also the multitude went and met him , because they heard that he had done this sign .
these , therefore , came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida of Galilee , and asked him , saying , " Sir , we want to see Jesus . "
most certainly I tell you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains by itself alone . but if it dies , it bears much fruit .
he who loves his life will lose it . he who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life .
if anyone serves me , let him follow me . where I am , there will my servant also be . if anyone serves me , the Father will honor him .
and I , if I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all people to myself . "
but he said this , signifying by what kind of death he should die .
the multitude answered him , " We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever . how do you say , ' The Son of Man must be lifted up ? ' who is this Son of Man ? "
while you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become children of light . " Jesus said these things , and he departed and hid himself from them .
but though he had done so many signs before them , yet they didn 't believe in him ,
that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spoke , " Lord , who has believed our report ? to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? "
nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him , but because of the Pharisees they didn 't confess it , so that they wouldn 't be put out of the synagogue ,
I have come as a light into the world , that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness .
if anyone listens to my sayings , and doesn 't believe , I don 't judge him . for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he who rejects me , and doesn 't receive my sayings , has one who judges him . the word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
for I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
I know that his commandment is eternal life . the things therefore which I speak , even as the Father has said to me , so I speak . "
during Supper , the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ,
Jesus , knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he came forth from God , and was going to God ,
arose from Supper , and laid aside his outer garments . he took a towel , and wrapped a towel around his waist .
then he poured water into the basin , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
Peter said to him , " You will never wash my feet ! " Jesus answered him , " If I don 't wash you , you have no part with me . "
Jesus said to him , " Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed , but is completely clean . you are clean , but not all of you . "
so when he had washed their feet , put his outer garment back on , and sat down again , he said to them , " Do you know what I have done to you ?
you call me , ' Teacher ' and ' Lord . ' you say so correctly , for so I am .
if I then , the Lord and the Teacher , have washed your feet , you also ought to wash one another 's feet .
for I have given you an example , that you also should do as I have done to you .
most certainly I tell you , a servant is not greater than his lord , neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him .
I don 't speak concerning all of you . I know whom I have chosen . but that the Scripture may be fulfilled , ' He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me . '
from now on , I tell you before it happens , that when it happens , you may believe that I am he .
one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved , was at the table , leaning against Jesus ' breast .
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , and said to him , " Tell us who it is of whom he speaks . "
when he had gone out , Jesus said , " Now the Son of Man has been glorified , and God has been glorified in him .
if God has been glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself , and he will glorify him immediately .
little children , I will be with you a little while longer . you will seek me , and as I said to the Jews , ' Where I am going , you can 't come , ' so now I tell you .
a new commandment I give to you , that you love one another , just like I have loved you ; that you also love one another .
by this everyone will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another . "
in my Father 's house are many homes . if it weren 't so , I would have told you . I am going to prepare a place for you .
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
where I go , you know , and you know the way . "
Jesus said to him , " I am the way , the truth , and the life . no one comes to the Father , except through me .
if you had known me , you would have known my Father also . from now on , you know him , and have seen him . "
believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ; or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my Father .
whatever you will ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
yet a little while , and the world will see me no more ; but you will see me . because I live , you will live also .
in that day you will know that I am in my Father , and you in me , and I in you .
one who has my commandments , and keeps them , that person is one who loves me . one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to him , " Lord , what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us , and not to the world ? "
Jesus answered him , " If a man loves me , he will keep my word . my Father will love him , and we will come to him , and make our home with him .
he who doesn 't love me doesn 't keep my words . the word which you hear isn 't mine , but the Father 's who sent me .
peace I leave with you . my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . Don 't let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fearful .
every branch in me that doesn 't bear fruit , he takes away . every branch that bears fruit , he prunes , that it may bear more fruit .
you are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you .
remain in me , and I in you . as the branch can 't bear fruit by itself , unless it remains in the vine , so neither can you , unless you remain in me .
I am the vine . you are the branches . he who remains in me , and I in him , the same bears much fruit , for apart from me you can do nothing .
if a man doesn 't remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is withered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
if you remain in me , and my words remain in you , you will ask whatever you desire , and it will be done for you .
" in this is my Father glorified , that you bear much fruit ; and so you will be my disciples .
if you keep my commandments , you will remain in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and remain in his love .
I have spoken these things to you , that my joy may remain in you , and that your joy may be made full .
" this is my commandment , that you love one another , even as I have loved you .
no longer do I call you servants , for the servant doesn 't know what his lord does . but I have called you friends , for everything that I heard from my Father , I have made known to you .
if you were of the world , the world would love its own . but because you are not of the world , since I chose you out of the world , therefore the world hates you .
but all these things will they do to you for my name 's sake , because they don 't know him who sent me .
if I had not come and spoken to them , they would not have had sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
if I hadn 't done among them the works which no one else did , they wouldn 't have had sin . but now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father .
but this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law , ' They hated me without a cause . '
" when the counselor has come , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will testify about me .
" these things have I spoken to you , so that you wouldn 't be caused to stumble .
they will put you out of the synagogues . yes , the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God .
they will do these things because they have not known the Father , nor me .
but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I didn 't tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
but because I have told you these things , sorrow has filled your heart .
about righteousness , because I am going to my Father , and you won 't see me any more ;
he will glorify me , for he will take from what is mine , and will declare it to you .
all things whatever the Father has are mine ; therefore I said that he takes of mine , and will declare it to you .
they said therefore , " What is this that he says , ' A little while ? ' we don 't know what he is saying . "
most certainly I tell you , that you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . you will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
therefore you now have sorrow , but I will see you again , and your heart will rejoice , and no one will take your joy away from you .
" in that day you will ask me no questions . most certainly I tell you , whatever you may ask of the Father in my name , he will give it to you .
until now , you have asked nothing in my name . ask , and you will receive , that your joy may be made full .
I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech . but the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech , but will tell you plainly about the Father .
in that day you will ask in my name ; and I don 't say to you , that I will pray to the Father for you ,
for the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me , and have believed that I came forth from God .
I came out from the Father , and have come into the world . again , I leave the world , and go to the Father . "
now we know that you know all things , and don 't need for anyone to question you . by this we believe that you came forth from God . "
I have told you these things , that in me you may have peace . in the world you have oppression ; but cheer up ! I have overcome the world . "
Jesus said these things , and lifting up his eyes to heaven , he said , " Father , the time has come . Glorify your Son , that your Son may also glorify you ;
this is eternal life , that they should know you , the only true God , and him whom you sent , Jesus Christ .
I glorified you on the earth . I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do .
now , Father , glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed .
now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you ,
for the words which you have given me I have given to them , and they received them , and knew for sure that I came forth from you , and they have believed that you sent me .
I pray for them . I don 't pray for the world , but for those whom you have given me , for they are yours .
all things that are mine are yours , and yours are mine , and I am glorified in them .
but now I come to you , and I say these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
I pray not that you would take them from the world , but that you would keep them from the evil one .
as you sent me into the world , even so I have sent them into the world .
for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth .
the glory which you have given me , I have given to them ; that they may be one , even as we are one ;
I in them , and you in me , that they may be perfected into one ; that the world may know that you sent me , and loved them , even as you loved me .
father , I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am , that they may see my glory , which you have given me , for you loved me before the foundation of the world .
I made known to them your name , and will make it known ; that the love with which you loved me may be in them , and I in them . "
when Jesus had spoken these words , he went out with his disciples over the Brook Kidron , where there was a garden , into which he and his disciples entered .
Jesus therefore , knowing all the things that were happening to him , went forth , and said to them , " Who are you looking for ? "
so the detachment , the commanding officer , and the officers of the Jews , seized Jesus and bound him ,
and led him to Annas first , for he was father @-@ in @-@ law to Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
Simon Peter followed Jesus , as did another disciple . now that disciple was known to the high priest , and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ;
now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of coals , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
why do you ask me ? ask those who have heard me what I said to them . behold , these know the things which I said . "
when he had said this , one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand , saying , " Do you answer the high priest like that ? "
one of the servants of the high priest , being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off , said , " Didn 't I see you in the garden with him ? "
they led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium . it was early , and they themselves didn 't enter into the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
Pilate therefore said to them , " Take him yourselves , and judge him according to your law . " therefore the Jews said to him , " It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death , "
that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spoke , signifying by what kind of death he should die .
but you have a custom , that I should release someone to you at the Passover . therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? "
the soldiers twisted thorns into a crown , and put it on his head , and dressed him in a purple garment .
then Pilate went out again , and said to them , " behold , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
Pilate therefore said to him , " Aren 't you speaking to me ? Don 't you know that I have power to release you , and have power to crucify you ? "
when Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pavement , " but in Hebrew , " Gabbatha . "
so then he delivered him to them to be crucified . so they took Jesus and led him away .
he went out , bearing his cross , to the place called " The Place of a skull , " which is called in Hebrew , " golgotha , "
Pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . there was written , " Jesus of NAZARETH , the King of the Jews . "
therefore many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , in Latin , and in Greek .
the chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate , " Don 't write , ' The King of the Jews , ' but , ' he said , I am King of the Jews . ' "
but there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
therefore when Jesus saw his mother , and the disciple whom he loved standing there , he said to his mother , " Woman , behold your son ! "
now a vessel full of vinegar was set there ; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop , and held it at his mouth .
when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , " It is finished . " he bowed his head , and gave up his spirit .
but when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was already dead , they didn 't break his legs .
Nicodemus , who at first came to Jesus by night , also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred Roman pounds .
so they took Jesus ' body , and bound it in linen cloths with the spices , as the custom of the Jews is to bury .
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden . in the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid .
for as yet they didn 't know the Scripture , that he must rise from the dead .
but Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping . so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ,
and she saw two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
they told her , " Woman , why are you weeping ? " she said to them , " Because they have taken away my Lord , and I don 't know where they have laid him . "
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . the disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord .
if you forgive anyone 's sins , they have been forgiven them . if you retain anyone 's sins , they have been retained . "
after eight days again his disciples were inside , and Thomas was with them . Jesus came , the doors being locked , and stood in the midst , and said , " Peace be to you . "
then he said to Thomas , " Reach here your finger , and see my hands . reach here your hand , and put it into my side . Don 't be unbelieving , but believing . "
therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book ;
but when day had already come , Jesus stood on the beach , yet the disciples didn 't know that it was Jesus .
but the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cubits away ) , dragging the net full of fish .
so when they got out on the land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid on it , and bread .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fish , one hundred fifty @-@ three ; and even though there were so many , the net wasn 't torn .
this is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples , after he had risen from the dead .
now he said this , signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God . when he had said this , he said to him , " Follow me . "
this is the disciple who testifies about these things , and wrote these things . we know that his witness is true .
there are also many other things which Jesus did , which if they would all be written , I suppose that even the world itself wouldn 't have room for the books that would be written .
to these he also showed himself alive after he suffered , by many proofs , appearing to them over a period of forty days , and speaking about God 's Kingdom .
being assembled together with them , he commanded them , " Don 't depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which you heard from me .
but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you . you will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem , in all Judea and Samaria , and to the uttermost parts of the earth . "
when he had said these things , as they were looking , he was taken up , and a cloud received him out of their sight .
then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet , which is near Jerusalem , a Sabbath day 's journey away .
all these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication , along with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers .
it became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called ' Akeldama , ' that is , ' The field of blood . '
now when the day of Pentecost had come , they were all with one accord in one place .
suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and began to speak with other languages , as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak .
now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews , devout men , from every nation under the sky .
when this sound was heard , the multitude came together , and were bewildered , because everyone heard them speaking in his own language .
yes , and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days , I will pour out my Spirit , and they will prophesy .
I will show wonders in the sky above , and signs on the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and billows of smoke .
the sun will be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes .
it will be , that whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved . '
" men of Israel , hear these words ! Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you , even as you yourselves know ,
him , being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God , you have taken by the hand of lawless men , crucified and killed ;
whom God raised up , having freed him from the agony of death , because it was not possible that he should be held by it .
for David says concerning him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved .
because you will not leave my soul in Hades , neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay .
you made known to me the ways of life . you will make me full of gladness with your presence . '
" brothers , I may tell you freely of the patriarch David , that he both died and was buried , and his tomb is with us to this day .
he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ , that neither was his soul left in Hades , nor did his flesh see decay .
being therefore exalted by the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this , which you now see and hear .
now when they heard this , they were cut to the heart , and said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles , " Brothers , what shall we do ? "
for the promise is to you , and to your children , and to all who are far off , even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself . "
they continued steadfastly in the Apostles ' teaching and fellowship , in the breaking of bread , and prayer .
they sold their possessions and goods , and distributed them to all , according as anyone had need .
Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer , the ninth hour .
seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple , he asked to receive gifts for the needy .
but Peter said , " Silver and gold have I none , but what I have , that I give you . in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , get up and walk ! "
he took him by the right hand , and raised him up . immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength .
Leaping up , he stood , and began to walk . he entered with them into the temple , walking , leaping , and praising God .
they recognized him , that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple . they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him .
as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
but you denied the Holy and Righteous One , and asked for a murderer to be granted to you ,
but the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets , that Christ should suffer , he thus fulfilled .
it will be , that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people . '
yes , and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
God , having raised up his servant , Jesus , sent him to you first , to bless you , in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness . "
as they spoke to the people , the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them ,
they laid hands on them , and put them in custody until the next day , for it was now evening .
it happened in the morning , that their rulers , elders , and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem .
Annas the high priest was there , with Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and as many as were relatives of the high priest .
when they had stood them in the middle of them , they inquired , " By what power , or in what name , have you done this ? "
then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said to them , " You rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
he is ' the stone which was regarded as worthless by you , the builders , which has become the head of the corner . '
there is salvation in none other , for neither is there any other name under heaven , that is given among men , by which we must be saved ! "
now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marveled . they recognized that they had been with Jesus .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
but so that this spreads no further among the people , let 's threaten them , that from now on they don 't speak to anyone in this name . "
for we can 't help telling the things which we saw and heard . "
when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding no way to punish them , because of the people ; for everyone glorified God for that which was done .
for the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old .
being let go , they came to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them .
who by the mouth of your servant , David , said , ' Why do the nations rage , and the peoples plot a vain thing ?
the kings of the earth take a stand , and the rulers take council together , against the Lord , and against his Christ . '
while you stretch out your hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus . "
when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they spoke the word of God with boldness .
but a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira , his wife , sold a possession ,
the young men arose and wrapped him up , and they carried him out and buried him .
she fell down immediately at his feet , and died . the young men came in and found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her by her husband .
by the hands of the Apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people . they were all with one accord in Solomon 's porch .
multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem , bringing sick people , and those who were tormented by unclean spirits : and they were all healed .
but the high priest rose up , and all those who were with him ( which is the sect of the Sadducees ) , and they were filled with jealousy ,
then the captain went with the officers , and brought them without violence , for they were afraid that the people might stone them .
the God of our fathers raised up Jesus , whom you killed , hanging him on a tree .
God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior , to give repentance to Israel , and remission of sins .
we are His witnesses of these things ; and so also is the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to those who obey him . "
but they , when they heard this , were cut to the heart , and determined to kill them .
they agreed with him . summoning the Apostles , they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
they therefore departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for Jesus ' name .
therefore select from among you , brothers , seven men of good report , full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly . a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
but some of those who were of the synagogue called " The Libertines , " and of the Cyrenians , of the Alexandrians , and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose , disputing with Stephen .
they weren 't able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke .
they stirred up the people , the elders , and the scribes , and came against him and seized him , and brought him in to the council ,
for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place , and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us . "
all who sat in the council , fastening their eyes on him , saw his face like it was the face of an angel .
then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and lived in Haran . from there , when his father was dead , God moved him into this land , where you are now living .
God spoke in this way : that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land , and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years .
but when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent out our fathers the first time .
on the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers , and Joseph 's race was revealed to Pharaoh .
and they were brought back to Shechem , and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem .
" but as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham , the people grew and multiplied in Egypt ,
the same took advantage of our race , and mistreated our fathers , and forced them to throw out their babies , so that they wouldn 't stay alive .
but when he was forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brothers , the children of Israel .
he supposed that his brothers understood that God , by his hand , was giving them deliverance ; but they didn 't understand .
" the day following , he appeared to them as they fought , and urged them to be at peace again , saying , ' Sirs , you are brothers . why do you wrong one another ? '
Moses fled at this saying , and became a stranger in the land of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
" when forty years were fulfilled , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai , in a flame of fire in a bush .
the Lord said to him , ' Take your sandals off of your feet , for the place where you stand is holy ground .
I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their groaning . I have come down to deliver them . now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
this man led them out , having worked wonders and signs in Egypt , in the Red Sea , and in the wilderness for forty years .
this is that Moses , who said to the children of Israel , ' The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . '
saying to Aaron , ' Make us gods that will go before us , for as for this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don 't know what has become of him . '
you took up the tabernacle of Moloch , the star of your god Rephan , the figures which you made to worship . I will carry you away beyond Babylon . '
" our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness , even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen ;
who found favor in the sight of God , and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob .
now when they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed at him with their teeth .
but he , being full of the Holy Spirit , looked up steadfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
but they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and rushed at him with one accord .
he kneeled down , and cried with a loud voice , " Lord , don 't hold this sin against them ! " when he had said this , he fell asleep .
Saul was consenting to his death . a great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day . they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria , except for the Apostles .
the multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
for unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them . they came out , crying with a loud voice . many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed .
they listened to him , because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries .
but when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
now when the Apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them ,
who , when they had come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Spirit ;
for as yet he had fallen on none of them . they had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus .
repent therefore of this , your wickedness , and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you .
for I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity . "
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans .
but an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip , saying , " arise , and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza . this is a desert . "
he was returning and sitting in his chariot , and was reading the prophet Isaiah .
now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this , " He was led as a sheep to the slaughter . as a lamb before his shearer is silent , so he doesn 't open his mouth .
in his humiliation , his judgment was taken away . who will declare His generation ? for his life is taken from the earth . "
he commanded the chariot to stand still , and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the eunuch , and he baptized him .
when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away , and the eunuch didn 't see him any more , for he went on his way rejoicing .
as he traveled , it happened that he got close to Damascus , and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him .
Saul arose from the ground , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no one . they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in , and laying his hands on him , that he might receive his sight . "
immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ , that he is the Son of God .
but his disciples took him by night , and let him down through the wall , lowering him in a basket .
he was with them entering into Jerusalem ,
preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus . he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists , but they were seeking to kill him .
when the brothers knew it , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him off to Tarsus .
so the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace , and were built up . they were multiplied , walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit .
it happened , as Peter went throughout all those parts , he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda .
there he found a certain man named Aeneas , who had been bedridden for eight years , because he was paralyzed .
all who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which when translated , means Dorcas . this woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did .
it happened in those days that she fell sick , and died . when they had washed her , they laid her in an upper room .
now there was a certain man in Caesarea , Cornelius by name , a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment ,
a devout man , and one who feared God with all his house , who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people , and always prayed to God .
when the angel who spoke to him had departed , Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually .
now on the next day as they were on their journey , and got close to the city , Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon .
he became hungry and desired to eat , but while they were preparing , he fell into a trance .
he saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him , like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth ,
in which were all kinds of four @-@ footed animals of the earth , wild animals , reptiles , and birds of the sky .
now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , behold , the men who were sent by Cornelius , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
on the next day they entered into Caesarea . Cornelius was waiting for them , having called together his relatives and his near friends .
when it happened that Peter entered , Cornelius met him , fell down at his feet , and worshiped him .
Cornelius said , " Four days ago , I was fasting until this hour , and at the ninth hour , I prayed in my house , and behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
and said , ' Cornelius , your prayer is heard , and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God .
the word which he sent to the children of Israel , preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ--he is Lord of all--
we are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they also killed , hanging him on a tree .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead .
while Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word .
they of the circumcision who believed were amazed , as many as came with Peter , because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles .
now the Apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God .
when Peter had come up to Jerusalem , those who were of the circumcision contended with him ,
when I had looked intently at it , I considered , and saw the four @-@ footed animals of the earth , wild animals , creeping things , and birds of the sky .
but a voice answered me the second time out of heaven , ' What God has cleansed , don 't you call unclean . '
the Spirit told me to go with them , without discriminating . these six brothers also accompanied me , and we entered into the man 's house .
he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house , and saying to him , ' Send to Joppa , and get Simon , whose surname is Peter ,
who will speak to you words by which you will be saved , you and all your house . '
I remembered the word of the Lord , how he said , ' John indeed baptized in water , but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit . '
if then God gave to them the same gift as us , when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I , that I could withstand God ? "
they therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , speaking the word to no one except to Jews only .
but there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who , when they had come to Antioch , spoke to the Hellenists , preaching the Lord Jesus .
the hand of the Lord was with them , and a great number believed and turned to the Lord .
the report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem . they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch ,
one of them named Agabus stood up , and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world , which also happened in the days of Claudius .
now about that time , King Herod stretched out his hands to oppress some of the assembly .
he killed James , the brother of John , with the sword .
when he saw that it pleased the Jews , he proceeded to seize Peter also . this was during the days of unleavened bread .
the same night when Herod was about to bring him out , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains . guards in front of the door kept the prison .
and he went out and followed him . he didn 't know that what was being done by the angel was real , but thought he saw a vision .
thinking about that , he came to the house of Mary , the mother of John whose surname was Mark , where many were gathered together and were praying .
when she recognized Peter 's voice , she didn 't open the gate for joy , but ran in , and reported that Peter was standing in front of the gate .
when Herod had sought for him , and didn 't find him , he examined the guards , and commanded that they should be put to death . he went down from Judea to Caesarea , and stayed there .
on an appointed day , Herod dressed himself in royal clothing , sat on the throne , and gave a speech to them .
now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers : Barnabas , Simeon who was called Niger , Lucius of Cyrene , Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
as they served the Lord and fasted , the Holy Spirit said , " separate Barnabas and Saul for me , for the work to which I have called them . "
so , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia . from there they sailed to Cyprus .
when they were at Salamis , they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues . they had also John as their attendant .
when they had gone through the island to Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Bar Jesus ,
then the proconsul , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the teaching of the Lord .
now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos , and came to Perga in Pamphylia . John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem .
but they , passing on from Perga , came to Antioch of Pisidia . they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and sat down .
after the reading of the law and the prophets , the rulers of the synagogue sent to them , saying , " Brothers , if you have any word of exhortation for the people , speak . "
afterward they asked for a king , and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
brothers , children of the stock of Abraham , and those among you who fear God , the word of this salvation is sent out to you .
for those who dwell in Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they didn 't know him , nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath , fulfilled them by condemning him .
when they had fulfilled all things that were written about him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a tomb .
and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are his witnesses to the people .
" concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has spoken thus : ' I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . '
for David , after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God , fell asleep , and was laid with his fathers , and saw decay .
so when the Jews went out of the synagogue , the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath .
now when the synagogue broke up , many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas ; who , speaking to them , urged them to continue in the grace of God .
but when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with jealousy , and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul , and blasphemed .
for so has the Lord commanded us , saying , ' I have set you as a light for the Gentiles , that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth . ' "
as the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of God . as many as were appointed to eternal life believed .
but the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city , and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and threw them out of their borders .
it happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews , and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed .
but the multitude of the city was divided . part sided with the Jews , and part with the Apostles .
when some of both the Gentiles and the Jews , with their rulers , made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them ,
at Lystra a certain man sat , impotent in his feet , a cripple from his mother 's womb , who never had walked .
when the multitude saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice , saying in the language of Lycaonia , " The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men ! "
they called Barnabas " Jupiter , " and Paul " Mercury , " because he was the chief speaker .
the priest of Jupiter , whose temple was in front of their city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates , and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes .
but when the Apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of it , they tore their clothes , and sprang into the multitude , crying out ,
yet he didn 't leave himself without witness , in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness . "
even saying these things , they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them .
but some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there , and having persuaded the multitudes , they stoned Paul , and dragged him out of the city , supposing that he was dead .
but as the disciples stood around him , he rose up , and entered into the city . on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe .
when they had appointed elders for them in every assembly , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they had believed .
when they had spoken the word in Perga , they went down to Attalia .
from there they sailed to Antioch , from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled .
when they had arrived , and had gathered the assembly together , they reported all the things that God had done with them , and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations .
some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers , " Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses , you can 't be saved . "
they , being sent on their way by the assembly , passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles . they caused great joy to all the brothers .
when they had come to Jerusalem , they were received by the assembly and the Apostles and the elders , and they reported all things that God had done with them .
but some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up , saying , " It is necessary to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the law of Moses . "
the Apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter .
now therefore why do you tempt God , that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
but we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus , just as they are . "
" therefore my judgment is that we don 't trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God ,
but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols , from sexual immorality , from what is strangled , and from blood .
they wrote these things by their hand : " the Apostles , the elders , and the brothers , to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch , Syria , and Cilicia : greetings .
it seemed good to us , having come to one accord , to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
we have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth .
so , when they were sent off , they came to Antioch . having gathered the multitude together , they delivered the letter .
but Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
but Paul didn 't think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia , and didn 't go with them to do the work .
then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other . Barnabas took Mark with him , and sailed away to Cyprus ,
but Paul chose Silas , and went out , being commended by the brothers to the grace of God .
he came to Derbe and Lystra : and behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timothy , the son of a Jewess who believed ; but his father was a Greek .
the brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him .
Paul wanted to have him go out with him , and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts ; for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
as they went on their way through the cities , they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the Apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem .
when they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia , they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia .
when they had come opposite Mysia , they tried to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit didn 't allow them .
a vision appeared to Paul in the night . there was a man of Macedonia standing , begging him , and saying , " Come over into Macedonia and help us . "
when he had seen the vision , immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia , concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them .
setting sail therefore from Troas , we made a straight course to Samothrace , and the day following to Neapolis ;
and from there to Philippi , which is a city of Macedonia , the foremost of the district , a Roman colony . we were staying some days in this city .
on the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside , where we supposed there was a place of prayer , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
following Paul and us , she cried out , " These men are servants of the Most High God , who proclaim to us a way of salvation ! "
but when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they seized Paul and Silas , and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers .
the multitude rose up together against them , and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them , and commanded them to be beaten with rods .
when they had laid many stripes on them , they threw them into prison , charging the jailer to keep them safely ,
who , having received such a command , threw them into the inner prison , and secured their feet in the stocks .
suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken ; and immediately all the doors were opened , and everyone 's bonds were loosened .
they spoke the word of the Lord to him , and to all who were in his house .
he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes , and was immediately baptized , he and all his household .
he brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and rejoiced greatly , with all his household , having believed in God .
the jailer reported these words to Paul , saying , " The magistrates have sent to let you go ; now therefore come out , and go in peace . "
and they came and begged them . when they had brought them out , they asked them to depart from the city .
they went out of the prison , and entered into Lydia 's house . when they had seen the brothers , they encouraged them , and departed .
now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where there was a Jewish synagogue .
Paul , as was his custom , went in to them , and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures ,
explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead , and saying , " This Jesus , whom I proclaim to you , is the Christ . "
some of them were persuaded , and joined Paul and Silas , of the devout Greeks a great multitude , and not a few of the chief women .
when they didn 't find them , they dragged Jason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city , crying , " These who have turned the world Upside down have come here also ,
the multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things .
the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea . when they arrived , they went into the Jewish synagogue .
now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind , examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so .
but when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also , they came there likewise , agitating the multitudes .
then the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea , and Silas and Timothy still stayed there .
but those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens . receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly , they departed .
now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols .
they took hold of him , and brought him to the Areopagus , saying , " May we know what this new teaching is , which is spoken by you ?
now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to hear some new thing .
Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus , and said , " You men of Athens , I perceive that you are very religious in all things .
for as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an altar with this inscription : ' to an unknown God . ' what therefore you worship in ignorance , this I announce to you .
the God who made the world and all things in it , he , being Lord of heaven and earth , doesn 't dwell in temples made with hands ,
he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth , having determined appointed seasons , and the boundaries of their dwellings ,
that they should seek the Lord , if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
'For in him we live , and move , and have our being . ' as some of your own poets have said , ' For we are also his offspring . '
being then the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold , or silver , or stone , engraved by art and design of man .
because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained ; of which he has given assurance to all men , in that he has raised him from the dead . "
but certain men joined with him , and believed , among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
he departed there , and went into the house of a certain man named Justus , one who worshiped God , whose house was next door to the synagogue .
Crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord with all his house . many of the Corinthians , when they heard , believed and were baptized .
the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision , " Don 't be afraid , but speak and don 't be silent ;
but when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat ,
then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . Gallio didn 't care about any of these things .
he came to Ephesus , and he left them there ; but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
but taking his leave of them , and saying , " I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem , but I will return again to you if God Wills , " he set sail from Ephesus .
when he had landed at Caesarea , he went up and greeted the assembly , and went down to Antioch .
having spent some time there , he departed , and went through the region of Galatia , and Phrygia , in order , establishing all the disciples .
this man had been instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in spirit , he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus , although he knew only the baptism of John .
he began to speak boldly in the synagogue . but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him aside , and explained to him the way of God more accurately .
for he powerfully refuted the Jews , publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ .
when Paul had laid his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came on them , and they spoke with other languages and prophesied .
he entered into the synagogue , and spoke boldly for a period of three months , reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God .
this continued for two years , so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks .
the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them , and overpowered them , and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
this became known to all , both Jews and Greeks , who lived at Ephesus . fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . they counted their price , and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver .
now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him , Timothy and Erastus , he himself stayed in Asia for a while .
for a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of Artemis , brought no little business to the craftsmen ,
when they heard this they were filled with anger , and cried out , saying , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
the whole city was filled with confusion , and they rushed with one accord into the theater , having seized Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul 's companions in travel .
certain also of the Asiarchs , being his friends , sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater .
some therefore cried one thing , and some another , for the assembly was in confusion . most of them didn 't know why they had come together .
they brought Alexander out of the multitude , the Jews putting him forward . Alexander beckoned with his hand , and would have made a defense to the people .
but when they perceived that he was a Jew , all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
if therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone , the courts are open , and there are proconsuls . let them press charges against one another .
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wouldn 't be able to give an account of this commotion . "
when he had gone through those parts , and had encouraged them with many words , he came into Greece .
when he had spent three months there , and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria , he determined to return through Macedonia .
but these had gone ahead , and were waiting for us at Troas .
we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread , and came to them at Troas in five days , where we stayed seven days .
on the first day of the week , when the disciples were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , intending to depart on the next day , and continued his speech until midnight .
a certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window , weighed down with deep sleep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sleep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
Paul went down , and fell upon him , and embracing him said , " Don 't be troubled , for his life is in him . "
when he had gone up , and had broken bread , and eaten , and had talked with them a long while , even until break of day , he departed .
but we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos , intending to take Paul aboard there , for he had so arranged , intending himself to go by land .
when he met us at Assos , we took him aboard , and came to Mitylene .
sailing from there , we came the following day opposite Chios . the next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium , and the day after we came to Miletus .
for Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was hastening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .
from Miletus he sent to Ephesus , and called to himself the elders of the assembly .
serving the Lord with all humility , with many tears , and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews ;
now , behold , I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem , not knowing what will happen to me there ;
" now , behold , I know that you all , among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God , will see my face no more .
for I didn 't shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God .
for I know that after my departure , vicious wolves will enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
men will arise from among your own selves , speaking perverse things , to draw away the disciples after them .
sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken , that they should see his face no more . and they accompanied him to the ship .
when it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail , we came with a straight course to Cos , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia , we went aboard , and set sail .
having found disciples , we stayed there seven days . these said to Paul through the Spirit , that he should not go up to Jerusalem .
after saying goodbye to each other , we went on board the ship , and they returned home again .
when we had finished the voyage from Tyre , we arrived at Ptolemais . we greeted the brothers , and stayed with them one day .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's companions , departed , and came to Caesarea . we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
when we heard these things , both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem .
some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us , bringing one Mnason of Cyprus , an early disciple , with whom we would stay .
what then ? the assembly must certainly meet , for they will hear that you have come .
when the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him ,
for they had seen Trophimus , the Ephesian , with him in the city , and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple .
all the city was moved , and the people ran together . they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple . immediately the doors were shut .
as they were trying to kill him , news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
immediately he took soldiers and centurions , and ran down to them . they , when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , stopped beating Paul .
when he came to the stairs , it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd ;
Aren 't you then the Egyptian , who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins ? "
it happened that , as I made my journey , and came close to Damascus , about noon , suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me .
I fell to the ground , and heard a voice saying to me , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? '
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they didn 't understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
I said , ' What shall I do , Lord ? ' the Lord said to me , ' arise , and go into Damascus . there you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do . '
when I couldn 't see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Damascus .
he said , ' The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will , and to see the Righteous One , and to hear a voice from his mouth .
for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard .
now why do you wait ? arise , be baptized , and wash away your sins , calling on the name of the Lord . '
when the blood of Stephen , your witness , was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting to his death , and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him . '
they listened to him until he said that ; then they lifted up their voice , and said , " Rid the earth of this fellow , for he isn 't fit to live ! "
when they had tied him up with thongs , Paul asked the centurion who stood by , " Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman , and not found guilty ? "
when the centurion heard it , he went to the commanding officer and told him , " Watch what you are about to do , for this man is a Roman ! "
immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him , and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
the high priest , Ananias , commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth .
Paul said , " I didn 't know , brothers , that he was high priest . for it is written , ' You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people . ' "
when he had said this , an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees , and the assembly was divided .
for the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , nor angel , nor spirit ; but the Pharisees confess all of these .
when a great argument arose , the commanding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
Paul summoned one of the centurions , and said , " Bring this young man to the commanding officer , for he has something to tell him . "
so he took him , and brought him to the commanding officer , and said , " Paul , the prisoner , summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
the commanding officer took him by the hand , and going aside , asked him privately , " What is it that you have to tell me ? "
so the commanding officer let the young man go , charging him , " Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me . "
he asked them to provide animals , that they might set Paul on one , and bring him safely to Felix the governor .
he wrote a letter like this :
when I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man , I sent him to you immediately , charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you . farewell . "
when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor , they also presented Paul to him .
after five days , the high priest , Ananias , came down with certain elders and an orator , one Tertullus . they informed the governor against Paul .
but , that I don 't delay you , I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words .
for we have found this man to be a plague , an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes .
he even tried to profane the temple , and we arrested him .
when the governor had beckoned to him to speak , Paul answered , " Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years , I cheerfully make my defense ,
having hope toward God , which these also themselves look for , that there will be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
they ought to have been here before you , and to make accusation , if they had anything against me .
or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council ,
unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them , ' concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today ! ' "
but Felix , having more exact knowledge concerning the Way , deferred them , saying , " When Lysias , the commanding officer , comes down , I will decide your case . "
he ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
but after some days , Felix came with Drusilla , his wife , who was a Jewess , and sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus .
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
but when two years were fulfilled , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus , and desiring to gain favor with the Jews , Felix left Paul in bonds .
Festus therefore , having come into the province , after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
when he had stayed among them more than ten days , he went down to Caesarea , and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat , and commanded Paul to be brought .
when he had come , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove ,
while he said in his defense , " Neither against the law of the Jews , nor against the temple , nor against Caesar , have I sinned at all . "
but Festus , desiring to gain favor with the Jews , answered Paul and said , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem , and be judged by me there concerning these things ? "
then Festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , " You have appealed to Caesar . to Caesar you shall go . "
about whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , asking for a sentence against him .
when therefore they had come together here , I didn 't delay , but on the next day sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought .
being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things , I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters .
for it seems to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not to also specify the charges against him . "
" indeed , all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up , which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem ;
having known me from the first , if they are willing to testify , that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
" I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
this I also did in Jerusalem . I both shut up many of the saints in prisons , having received authority from the chief priests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
at noon , O king , I saw on the way a light from the sky , brighter than the sun , shining around me and those who traveled with me .
when we had all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? it is hard for you to kick against the goads . '
for this reason the Jews seized me in the temple , and tried to kill me .
how the Christ must suffer , and how , by the resurrection of the dead , he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles . "
when it was determined that we should sail for Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius , of the Augustan band .
embarking in a ship of Adramyttium , which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia , we put to sea ; Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
the next day , we touched at Sidon . Julius treated Paul kindly , and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself .
when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
when we had sailed slowly many days , and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus , the wind not allowing us further , we sailed under the Lee of Crete , opposite Salmone .
but the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul .
when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete , close to shore .
when the ship was caught , and couldn 't face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven along .
running under the Lee of a small island called Clauda , we were able , with difficulty , to secure the boat .
after they had hoisted it up , they used cables to help reinforce the ship . fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars , they lowered the sea anchor , and so were driven along .
when neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days , and no small storm pressed on us , all hope that we would be saved was now taken away .
now I exhort you to cheer up , for there will be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship .
therefore , sirs , cheer up ! for I believe God , that it will be just as it has been spoken to me .
but when the fourteenth night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land .
fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground , they let go four anchors from the stern , and wished for daylight .
as the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea , pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow ,
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , " Unless these stay in the ship , you can 't be saved . "
then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat , and let it fall off .
in all , we were two hundred seventy @-@ six souls on the ship .
when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , throwing out the wheat into the sea .
when it was day , they didn 't recognize the land , but they noticed a certain bay with a beach , and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it .
casting off the anchors , they left them in the sea , at the same time untying the rudder ropes . Hoisting up the foresail to the wind , they made for the beach .
the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , so that none of them would swim out and escape .
when we had escaped , then they learned that the island was called Malta .
the natives showed us uncommon kindness ; for they kindled a fire , and received us all , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
but when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island , named Publius , who received us , and courteously entertained us for three days .
it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery . Paul entered in to him , prayed , and laying his hands on him , healed him .
then when this was done , the rest also who had diseases in the island came , and were cured .
they also honored us with many honors , and when we sailed , they put on board the things that we needed .
after three months , we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island , whose sign was " The Twin Brothers . "
from there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium . after one day , a south wind sprang up , and on the second day we came to Puteoli ,
where we found brothers , and were entreated to stay with them for seven days . so we came to Rome .
from there the brothers , when they heard of us , came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three taverns . when Paul saw them , he thanked God , and took courage .
when we entered into Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
who , when they had examined me , desired to set me free , because there was no cause of death in me .
for this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you . for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain . "
but we desire to hear from you what you think . for , as concerning this sect , it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against . "
when they didn 't agree among themselves , they departed after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah , the prophet , to our fathers ,
Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an Apostle , set apart for the Good News of God ,
to all who are in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
first , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world .
for I long to see you , that I may impart to you some spiritual gift , to the end that you may be established ;
that is , that I with you may be encouraged in you , each of us by the other 's faith , both yours and mine .
I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners , both to the wise and to the foolish .
so , as much as is in me , I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome .
for I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ , for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes ; for the Jew first , and also for the Greek .
for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who suppress the truth in unrighteousness ,
for the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made , even his everlasting power and divinity ; that they may be without excuse .
because , knowing God , they didn 't glorify him as God , neither gave thanks , but became vain in their reasoning , and their senseless heart was darkened .
and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man , and of birds , and four @-@ footed animals , and creeping things .
therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness , that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves ,
for this reason , God gave them up to vile passions . for their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature .
even as they refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not fitting ;
being filled with all unrighteousness , sexual immorality , wickedness , covetousness , malice ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , evil habits , secret slanderers ,
backbiters , hateful to God , insolent , haughty , boastful , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
who , knowing the ordinance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but also approve of those who practice them .
we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things .
do you think this , O man who judges those who practice such things , and do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
or do you despise the riches of his Goodness , forbearance , and patience , not knowing that the Goodness of God leads you to repentance ?
but according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath , revelation , and of the righteous judgment of God ;
to those who by patience in well @-@ doing seek for glory , honor , and incorruptibility , eternal life ;
but to those who are self @-@ seeking , and don 't obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , will be wrath and indignation ,
for as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law . as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law .
for it isn 't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God , but the doers of the law will be justified
( for when Gentiles who don 't have the law do by nature the things of the law , these , not having the law , are a law to themselves ,
in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience testifying with them , and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them )
indeed you bear the name of a Jew , and rest on the law , and glory in God ,
and know his will , and approve the things that are excellent , being instructed out of the law ,
you therefore who teach another , don 't you teach yourself ? you who preach that a man shouldn 't steal , do you steal ?
you who glory in the law , through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God ?
for circumcision indeed profits , if you are a doer of the law , but if you are a transgressor of the law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
if therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law , won 't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision ?
won 't the uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfills the law , judge you , who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law ?
then what advantage does the Jew have ? or what is the profit of circumcision ?
May it never be ! yes , let God be found true , but every man a liar . as it is written , " That you might be justified in your words , and might prevail when you come into judgment . "
but if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God , what will we say ? is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath ? I speak like men do .
why not ( as we are slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ) , " Let us do evil , that good may come ? " those who say so are justly condemned .
there is no one who understands . there is no one who seeks after God .
they have all turned aside . they have together become unprofitable . there is no one who does good , no , not , so much as one . "
" their throat is an open tomb . with their tongues they have used deceit . " " the poison of vipers is under their lips " ;
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
because by the works of the law , no flesh will be justified in his sight . for through the law comes the knowledge of sin .
but now apart from the law , a righteousness of God has been revealed , being testified by the law and the prophets ;
since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith , and the uncircumcised through faith .
what then will we say that Abraham , our forefather , has found according to the flesh ?
now to him who works , the reward is not counted as grace , but as something owed .
but to him who doesn 't work , but believes in him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is accounted for righteousness .
blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin . "
how then was it counted ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
he is the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had in uncircumcision .
for the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn 't through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
for if those who are of the law are heirs , faith is made void , and the promise is made of no effect .
without being weakened in faith , he didn 't consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the deadness of Sarah 's womb .
yet , looking to the promise of God , he didn 't waver through unbelief , but grew strong through faith , giving glory to God ,
and being fully assured that what he had promised , he was also able to perform .
therefore it also was " reckoned to him for righteousness . "
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand . we rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
not only this , but we also rejoice in our sufferings , knowing that suffering works perseverance ;
and hope doesn 't disappoint us , because God 's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
much more then , being now justified by his blood , we will be saved from God 's wrath through him .
for if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we will be saved by his life .
for until the law , sin was in the world ; but sin is not charged when there is no law .
nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses , even over those whose sins weren 't like Adam 's disobedience , who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come .
for as through the one man 's disobedience many were made sinners , even so through the obedience of the one , many will be made righteous .
May it never be ! we who died to sin , how could we live in it any longer ?
or don 't you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
we were buried therefore with him through baptism to death , that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we also might walk in newness of life .
for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death , we will also be part of his resurrection ;
knowing this , that our old man was crucified with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin .
but if we died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him ;
for the death that he died , he died to sin one time ; but the life that he lives , he lives to God .
therefore don 't let sin reign in your mortal body , that you should obey it in its lusts .
neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness , but present yourselves to God , as alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness to God .
but thanks be to God , that , whereas you were bondservants of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered .
for when you were servants of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
but now , being made free from sin , and having become servants of God , you have your fruit of sanctification , and the result of eternal life .
or don 't you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives ?
for the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives , but if the husband dies , she is discharged from the law of the husband .
for when we were in the flesh , the sinful passions which were through the law , worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death .
for I don 't know what I am doing . for I don 't practice what I desire to do ; but what I hate , that I do .
but if what I don 't desire , that I do , I consent to the law that it is good .
so now it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwells in me .
for I know that in me , that is , in my flesh , dwells no good thing . for desire is present with me , but I don 't find it doing that which is good .
for the good which I desire , I don 't do ; but the evil which I don 't desire , that I practice .
but if what I don 't desire , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwells in me .
but I see a different law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members .
what a wretched man I am ! who will deliver me out of the body of this death ?
there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus , who don 't walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
for the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death .
that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit , the things of the Spirit .
for the mind of the flesh is death , but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace ;
because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God ; for it is not subject to God 's law , neither indeed can it be .
but you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you . but if any man doesn 't have the Spirit of Christ , he is not his .
if Christ is in you , the body is dead because of sin , but the spirit is alive because of righteousness .
but if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you .
for if you live after the flesh , you must die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
for as many as are led by the Spirit of God , these are children of God .
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint heirs with Christ ; if indeed we suffer with him , that we may also be glorified with him .
for I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us .
for the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed .
not only so , but ourselves also , who have the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for adoption , the redemption of our body .
for we were saved in hope , but hope that is seen is not hope . for who hopes for that which he sees ?
but if we hope for that which we don 't see , we wait for it with patience .
we know that all things work together for good for those who love God , to those who are called according to his purpose .
whom he predestined , those he also called . whom he called , those he also justified . whom he justified , those he also glorified .
what then shall we say about these things ? if God is for us , who can be against us ?
he who didn 't spare his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how would he not also with him freely give us all things ?
who could bring a charge against God 's chosen ones ? it is God who justifies .
even as it is written , " For your sake we are killed all day long . we were accounted as sheep for the slaughter . "
no , in all these things , we are more than conquerors through him who loved us .
but it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing . for they are not all Israel , that are of Israel .
that is , it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God , but the children of the promise are counted as a seed .
for this is a word of promise , " At the appointed time I will come , and Sarah will have a son . "
for he said to Moses , " I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . "
so then it is not of him who Wills , nor of him who runs , but of God who has mercy .
so then , he has mercy on whom he desires , and he hardens whom he desires .
or hasn 't the Potter a right over the clay , from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor , and another for dishonor ?
what if God , willing to show his wrath , and to make his power known , endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction ,
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy , which he prepared beforehand for glory ,
as he says also in Hosea , " I will call them ' my people , ' which were not my people ; and her ' beloved , ' who was not beloved . "
Isaiah cries concerning Israel , " If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea , it is the remnant who will be saved ;
for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness , because the Lord will make a short work upon the earth . "
as Isaiah has said before , " Unless the Lord of Armies had left us a seed , we would have become like Sodom , and would have been made like Gomorrah . "
what shall we say then ? that the Gentiles , who didn 't follow after righteousness , attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith ;
but Israel , following after a law of righteousness , didn 't arrive at the law of righteousness .
brothers , my heart 's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel , that they may be saved .
for being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and seeking to establish their own righteousness , they didn 't subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
for with the heart , one believes unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
for , " Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved . "
how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? how will they believe in him whom they have not heard ? how will they hear without a preacher ?
and how will they preach unless they are sent ? as it is written : " how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace , who bring glad tidings of good things ! "
but I say , didn 't they hear ? yes , most certainly , " Their sound went out into all the earth , their words to the ends of the world . "
I ask then , did God reject his people ? May it never be ! for I also am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
but how does God answer him ? " I have reserved for myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to Baal . "
and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
what then ? that which Israel seeks for , that he didn 't obtain , but the chosen ones obtained it , and the rest were hardened .
David says , " Let their table be made a snare , and a trap , a stumbling block , and a retribution to them .
let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see . bow down their back always . "
now if their fall is the riches of the world , and their loss the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fullness ?
for I speak to you who are Gentiles . since then as I am an Apostle to Gentiles , I glorify my ministry ;
if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh , and may save some of them .
for if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world , what would their acceptance be , but life from the dead ?
if the first fruit is holy , so is the lump . if the root is holy , so are the branches .
true ; by their unbelief they were broken off , and you stand by your faith . Don 't be conceited , but fear ;
see then the Goodness and severity of God . toward those who fell , severity ; but toward you , Goodness , if you continue in his Goodness ; otherwise you also will be cut off .
they also , if they don 't continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
and so all Israel will be saved . even as it is written , " There will come out of Zion the Deliverer , and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob .
concerning the Good News , they are enemies for your sake . but concerning the election , they are beloved for the fathers ' sake .
for as you in time past were disobedient to God , but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience ,
Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past tracing out !
therefore I urge you , brothers , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable to God , which is your spiritual service .
Don 't be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you may prove what is the good , well @-@ pleasing , and perfect will of God .
having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us , if prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith ;
or service , let us give ourselves to service ; or he who teaches , to his teaching ;
or he who exhorts , to his exhorting : he who gives , let him do it with liberality ; he who rules , with diligence ; he who shows mercy , with cheerfulness .
let love be without hypocrisy . Abhor that which is evil . cling to that which is good .
in love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another ; in honor preferring one another ;
rejoice with those who rejoice . Weep with those who weep .
be of the same mind one toward another . Don 't set your mind on high things , but associate with the humble . Don 't be wise in your own conceits .
if it is possible , as much as it is up to you , be at peace with all men .
therefore " If your enemy is hungry , feed him . if he is thirsty , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will heap coals of fire on his head . "
Don 't be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities , for there is no authority except from God , and those who exist are ordained by God .
therefore he who resists the authority , withstands the ordinance of God ; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment .
for this reason you also pay taxes , for they are servants of God 's service , attending continually on this very thing .
do this , knowing the time , that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep , for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed .
let us walk properly , as in the day ; not in reveling and drunkenness , not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts , and not in strife and jealousy .
but put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh , for its lusts .
Don 't let him who eats despise him who doesn 't eat . Don 't let him who doesn 't eat judge him who eats , for God has accepted him .
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
for to this end Christ died , rose , and lived again , that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
but you , why do you judge your brother ? or you again , why do you despise your brother ? for we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
therefore let 's not judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block in his brother 's way , or an occasion for falling .
I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean of itself ; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
yet if because of food your brother is grieved , you walk no longer in love . Don 't destroy with your food him for whom Christ died .
so then , let us follow after things which make for peace , and things by which we may build one another up .
Don 't overthrow God 's work for food 's sake . all things indeed are clean , however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating .
do you have faith ? have it to yourself before God . happy is he who doesn 't judge himself in that which he approves .
let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good , to be building him up .
for even Christ didn 't please himself . but , as it is written , " The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me . "
for whatever things were written before were written for our learning , that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope .
now the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus ,
now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that you may abound in hope , in the power of the Holy Spirit .
I myself am also persuaded about you , my brothers , that you yourselves are full of Goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish others .
but I write the more boldly to you in part , as reminding you , because of the grace that was given to me by God ,
yes , making it my aim to preach the Good News , not where Christ was already named , that I might not build on another 's foundation .
but now , I say , I am going to Jerusalem , serving the saints .
for it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem .
yes , it has been their good pleasure , and they are their debtors . for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things .
when therefore I have accomplished this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will go on by way of you to Spain .
I know that , when I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ .
now I beg you , brothers , by our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the love of the Spirit , that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea , and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ;
that I may come to you in joy through the will of God , and together with you , find rest .
I commend to you Phoebe , our sister , who is a servant of the assembly that is at Cenchreae ,
who for my life , laid down their own necks ; to whom not only I give thanks , but also all the assemblies of the Gentiles .
greet Andronicus and Junia , my relatives and my fellow prisoners , who are notable among the Apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
greet Herodion , my kinsman . greet them of the household of Narcissus , who are in the Lord .
greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who labor in the Lord . greet Persis , the beloved , who labored much in the Lord .
greet Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
now I beg you , brothers , look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling , contrary to the doctrine which you learned , and turn away from them .
for those who are such don 't serve our Lord , Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by their smooth and flattering speech , they deceive the hearts of the innocent .
and the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet . the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
Timothy , my fellow worker , greets you , as do Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater , my relatives .
Gaius , my host and host of the whole assembly , greets you . Erastus , the treasurer of the city , greets you , as does Quartus , the brother .
I always thank my God concerning you , for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus ;
who will also confirm you until the end , blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ , our Lord .
for it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Chloe 's household , that there are contentions among you .
( I also baptized the household of Stephanas ; besides them , I don 't know whether I baptized any other . )
for Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the Good News--not in wisdom of words , so that the cross of Christ wouldn 't be made void .
for the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying , but to us who are saved it is the power of God .
for it is written , " I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing . "
where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the lawyer of this world ? Hasn 't God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
for seeing that in the wisdom of God , the world through its wisdom didn 't know God , it was God 's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe .
but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
for you see your calling , brothers , that not many are wise according to the flesh , not many mighty , and not many noble ;
but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to shame the things that are strong ;
and God chose the lowly things of the world , and the things that are despised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
but of him , you are in Christ Jesus , who was made to us wisdom from God , and righteousness and sanctification , and redemption :
when I came to you , brothers , I didn 't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom , proclaiming to you the testimony of God .
my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
that your faith wouldn 't stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
we speak wisdom , however , among those who are full grown ; yet a wisdom not of this world , nor of the rulers of this world , who are coming to nothing .
but to us , God revealed them through the Spirit . for the Spirit searches all things , yes , the deep things of God .
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spirit .
but we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
which things also we speak , not in words which man 's wisdom teaches , but which the Holy Spirit teaches , comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .
now the natural man doesn 't receive the things of God 's Spirit , for they are foolishness to him , and he can 't know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
I fed you with milk , not with meat ; for you weren 't yet ready . indeed , not even now are you ready ,
for you are still fleshly . for insofar as there is jealousy , strife , and factions among you , aren 't you fleshly , and don 't you walk in the ways of men ?
who then is Apollos , and who is Paul , but servants through whom you believed ; and each as the Lord gave to him ?
so then neither he who plants is anything , nor he who waters , but God who gives the increase .
now he who plants and he who waters are the same , but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
for no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid , which is Jesus Christ .
each man 's work will be revealed . for the Day will declare it , because it is revealed in fire ; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man 's work is .
if any man 's work remains which he built on it , he will receive a reward .
if any man 's work is burned , he will suffer loss , but he himself will be saved , but as through fire .
Don 't you know that you are a temple of God , and that God 's Spirit lives in you ?
let no one deceive himself . if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world , let him become a fool , that he may become wise .
whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come . all are yours ,
so let a man think of us as Christ 's servants , and stewards of God 's mysteries .
here , moreover , it is required of stewards , that they be found faithful .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don 't judge my own self .
for I know nothing against myself . yet I am not justified by this , but he who judges me is the Lord .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you didn 't receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
you are already filled . you have already become rich . you have come to reign without us . yes , and I wish that you did reign , that we also might reign with you .
we are fools for Christ 's sake , but you are wise in Christ . we are weak , but you are strong . you have honor , but we have dishonor .
even to this present hour we hunger , thirst , are naked , are beaten , and have no certain dwelling place .
we toil , working with our own hands . when people curse us , we bless . being persecuted , we endure .
being defamed , we entreat . we are made as the Filth of the world , the dirt wiped off by all , even until now .
I don 't write these things to shame you , but to admonish you as my beloved children .
for though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ , yet not many fathers . for in Christ Jesus , I became your father through the Good News .
now some are puffed up , as though I were not coming to you .
for the Kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .
what do you want ? shall I come to you with a rod , or in love and a spirit of gentleness ?
it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles , that one has his father 's wife .
you are puffed up , and didn 't rather mourn , that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you .
your boasting is not good . Don 't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump ?
purge out the old yeast , that you may be a new lump , even as you are unleavened . for indeed Christ , our Passover , has been sacrificed in our place .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old yeast , neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners ;
yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world , or with the covetous and extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then you would have to leave the world .
dare any of you , having a matter against his neighbor , go to law before the unrighteous , and not before the saints ?
Don 't you know that the saints will judge the world ? and if the world is judged by you , are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
Don 't you know that we will judge angels ? how much more , things that pertain to this life ?
if then , you have to judge things pertaining to this life , do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly ?
I say this to move you to shame . Isn 't there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers ?
therefore it is already altogether a defect in you , that you have lawsuits one with another . why not rather be wronged ? why not rather be defrauded ?
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sanctified . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
now God raised up the Lord , and will also raise us up by his power .
Don 't you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them members of a prostitute ? May it never be !
or don 't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body ? for , " The two , " says he , " will become one flesh . "
flee sexual immorality ! " every sin that a man does is outside the body , " but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body .
or don 't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
for you were bought with a price . therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit , which are God 's .
now concerning the things about which you wrote to me : it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
but , because of sexual immoralities , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
the wife doesn 't have authority over her own body , but the husband . likewise also the husband doesn 't have authority over his own body , but the wife .
yet I wish that all men were like me . however each man has his own gift from God , one of this kind , and another of that kind .
but I say to the unmarried and to widows , it is good for them if they remain even as I am .
but if they don 't have self @-@ control , let them marry . for it 's better to marry than to burn .
( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
but to the rest I--not the Lord--say , if any brother has an unbelieving wife , and she is content to live with him , let him not leave her .
the woman who has an unbelieving husband , and he is content to live with her , let her not leave her husband .
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband . otherwise your children would be unclean , but now they are holy .
yet if the unbeliever departs , let there be separation . the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called us in peace .
for how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
only , as the Lord has distributed to each man , as God has called each , so let him walk . so I command in all the assemblies .
was anyone called having been circumcised ? let him not become uncircumcised . has anyone been called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
were you called being a bondservant ? Don 't let that bother you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it .
for he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord 's free man . likewise he who was called being free is Christ 's bondservant .
now concerning virgins , I have no commandment from the Lord , but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy .
I think that it is good therefore , because of the distress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
are you bound to a wife ? Don 't seek to be freed . are you free from a wife ? Don 't seek a wife .
but I desire to have you to be free from cares . he who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world , how he may please his wife .
this I say for your own profit ; not that I may ensnare you , but for that which is appropriate , and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction .
but he who stands steadfast in his heart , having no necessity , but has power over his own heart , to keep his own virgin , does well .
so then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well , and he who doesn 't give her in marriage does better .
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to whomever she desires , only in the Lord .
but if anyone thinks that he knows anything , he doesn 't yet know as he ought to know .
but if anyone loves God , the same is known by him .
but food will not commend us to God . for neither , if we don 't eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
but be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak .
for if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol 's temple , won 't his conscience , if he is weak , be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols ?
therefore if food causes my brother to stumble , I will eat no meat forevermore , that I don 't cause my brother to stumble .
am I not free ? am I not an Apostle ? haven 't I seen Jesus Christ , our Lord ? Aren 't you my work in the Lord ?
if to others I am not an Apostle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer , even as the rest of the Apostles , and the brothers of the Lord , and Cephas ?
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a vineyard , and doesn 't eat of its fruit ? or who feeds a flock , and doesn 't drink from the flock 's milk ?
do I speak these things according to the ways of men ? or doesn 't the law also say the same thing ?
if we sowed to you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things ?
Don 't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple , and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar ?
even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News .
but I have used none of these things , and I don 't write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my boasting void .
for if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . but if not of my own will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me .
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
for though I was free from all , I brought myself under bondage to all , that I might gain the more .
to the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
now I do this for the sake of the Good News , that I may be a joint partaker of it .
Don 't you know that those who run in a race all run , but one receives the prize ? run like that , that you may win .
but I beat my body and bring it into submission , lest by any means , after I have preached to others , I myself should be rejected .
now I would not have you ignorant , brothers , that our fathers were all under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
and all drank the same spiritual drink . for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ .
now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted .
neither be idolaters , as some of them were . as it is written , " The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play . "
neither let us commit sexual immorality , as some of them committed , and in one day twenty @-@ three thousand fell .
neither let us test the Lord , as some of them tested , and perished by the Serpents .
now all these things happened to them by way of example , and they were written for our admonition , on whom the ends of the ages have come .
the cup of blessing which we bless , isn 't it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , isn 't it a sharing of the body of Christ ?
because there is one loaf of bread , we , who are many , are one body ; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread .
consider Israel according to the flesh . Don 't those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar ?
but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to demons , and not to God , and I don 't desire that you would have fellowship with demons .
you can 't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . you can 't both partake of the table of the Lord , and of the table of demons .
let no one seek his own , but each one his neighbor 's good .
whatever is sold in the butcher shop , eat , asking no question for the sake of conscience ,
conscience , I say , not your own , but the other 's conscience . for why is my liberty judged by another conscience ?
if I partake with thankfulness , why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks ?
give no occasions for stumbling , either to Jews , or to Greeks , or to the assembly of God ;
even as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be saved .
now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
for if a woman is not covered , let her also be shorn . but if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
for this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head , because of the angels .
nevertheless , neither is the woman independent of the man , nor the man independent of the woman , in the Lord .
for as woman came from man , so a man also comes through a woman ; but all things are from God .
but in giving you this command , I don 't praise you , that you come together not for the better but for the worse .
for first of all , when you come together in the assembly , I hear that divisions exist among you , and I partly believe it .
for there also must be factions among you , that those who are approved may be revealed among you .
when therefore you assemble yourselves together , it is not the Lord 's Supper that you eat .
in the same way he also took the cup , after Supper , saying , " This cup is the new Covenant in my blood . do this , as often as you drink , in memory of me . "
therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord 's cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of the bread , and drink of the cup .
for he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he doesn 't discern the Lord 's body .
for if we discerned ourselves , we wouldn 't be judged .
but when we are judged , we are punished by the Lord , that we may not be condemned with the world .
therefore , my brothers , when you come together to eat , wait for one another .
but if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest your coming together be for judgment . the rest I will set in order whenever I come .
you know that when you were heathen , you were led away to those mute idols , however you might be led .
there are various kinds of workings , but the same God , who works all things in all .
for as the body is one , and has many members , and all the members of the body , being many , are one body ; so also is Christ .
if the foot would say , " Because I 'm not the hand , I 'm not part of the body , " it is not therefore not part of the body .
if the ear would say , " Because I 'm not the eye , I 'm not part of the body , " it 's not therefore not part of the body .
if the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? if the whole were hearing , where would the smelling be ?
but now God has set the members , each one of them , in the body , just as he desired .
the eye can 't tell the hand , " I have no need for you , " or again the head to the feet , " I have no need for you . "
no , much rather , those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary .
those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable , on those we bestow more abundant honor ; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety ;
that there should be no division in the body , but that the members should have the same care for one another .
if I speak with the languages of men and of angels , but don 't have love , I have become sounding brass , or a clanging cymbal .
if I have the gift of prophecy , and know all mysteries and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but don 't have love , I am nothing .
if I dole out all my goods to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but don 't have love , it profits me nothing .
love is patient and is kind ; love doesn 't envy . love doesn 't brag , is not proud ,
doesn 't behave itself inappropriately , doesn 't seek its own way , is not provoked , takes no account of evil ;
but when that which is complete has come , then that which is partial will be done away with .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away childish things .
for he who speaks in another language speaks not to men , but to God ; for no one understands ; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries .
for if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound , who would prepare himself for war ?
so also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of sounds in the world , and none of them is without meaning .
if then I don 't know the meaning of the sound , I would be to him who speaks a foreigner , and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me .
so also you , since you are zealous for spiritual gifts , seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly .
what is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
for you most certainly give thanks well , but the other person is not built up .
I thank my God , I speak with other languages more than you all .
however in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in another language .
in the law it is written , " By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people . not even thus will they hear me , says the Lord . "
therefore other languages are for a sign , not to those who believe , but to the unbelieving ; but prophesying is for a sign , not to the unbelieving , but to those who believe .
and thus the secrets of his heart are revealed . so he will fall down on his face and worship God , declaring that God is among you indeed .
if any man speaks in another language , let it be two , or at the most three , and in turn ; and let one interpret .
but if there is no interpreter , let him keep silent in the assembly , and let him speak to himself , and to God .
but if a revelation is made to another sitting by , let the first keep silent .
for you all can prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be exhorted .
for God is not a God of confusion , but of peace . as in all the assemblies of the saints ,
let your wives keep silent in the assemblies , for it has not been permitted for them to speak ; but let them be in subjection , as the law also says .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly .
what ? was it from you that the word of God went out ? or did it come to you alone ?
if any man thinks himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him recognize the things which I write to you , that they are the commandment of the Lord .
therefore , brothers , desire earnestly to prophesy , and don 't forbid speaking with other languages .
now I declare to you , brothers , the Good News which I preached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand ,
by which also you are saved , if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you--unless you believed in vain .
then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once , most of whom remain until now , but some have also fallen asleep .
then he appeared to James , then to all the Apostles ,
for I am the least of the Apostles , who is not worthy to be called an Apostle , because I persecuted the assembly of God .
now if Christ is preached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
but if there is no resurrection of the dead , neither has Christ been raised .
if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain , and your faith also is in vain .
yes , we are found false witnesses of God , because we testified about God that he raised up Christ , whom he didn 't raise up , if it is so that the dead are not raised .
for if the dead aren 't raised , neither has Christ been raised .
if Christ has not been raised , your faith is vain ; you are still in your sins .
but now Christ has been raised from the dead . he became the first fruits of those who are asleep .
for as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive .
then the end comes , when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power .
when all things have been subjected to him , then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him , that God may be all in all .
or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead ? if the dead aren 't raised at all , why then are they baptized for the dead ?
if I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes , what does it profit me ? if the dead are not raised , then " let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . "
wake up righteously , and don 't sin , for some have no knowledge of God . I say this to your shame .
that which you sow , you don 't sow the body that will be , but a bare grain , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind .
but God gives it a body even as it pleased him , and to each seed a body of its own .
all flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of men , another flesh of animals , another of fish , and another of birds .
there are also celestial bodies , and terrestrial bodies ; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial .
there is one glory of the sun , another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differs from another star in glory .
so also is the resurrection of the dead . it is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption .
it is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .
it is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . there is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body .
so also it is written , " The first man , Adam , became a living soul . " the last Adam became a life @-@ giving spirit .
however that which is spiritual isn 't first , but that which is natural , then that which is spiritual .
the first man is of the earth , made of dust . the second man is the Lord from heaven .
as is the one made of dust , such are those who are also made of dust ; and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
as we have borne the image of those made of dust , let 's also bear the image of the heavenly .
but when this corruptible will have put on incorruption , and this mortal will have put on immortality , then what is written will happen : " death is swallowed up in victory . "
therefore , my beloved brothers , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the Lord 's work , because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .
on the first day of the week , let each one of you save , as he may prosper , that no collections be made when I come .
when I arrive , I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem .
but I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia , for I am passing through Macedonia .
for I do not wish to see you now in passing , but I hope to stay a while with you , if the Lord permits .
now if Timothy comes , see that he is with you without fear , for he does the work of the Lord , as I also do .
therefore let no one despise him . but set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus ; for that which was lacking on your part , they supplied .
the assemblies of Asia greet you . Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord , together with the assembly that is in their house .
Paul , an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia :
who comforts us in all our affliction , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
our hope for you is steadfast , knowing that , since you are partakers of the sufferings , so also are you of the comfort .
yes , we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead ,
for our boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in holiness and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you .
but as God is faithful , our word toward you was not " Yes and no . "
for however many are the promises of God , in him is the " Yes . " therefore also through him is the " Amen , " to the glory of God through us .
now he who establishes us with you in Christ , and anointed us , is God ;
who also sealed us , and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts .
but I call God for a witness to my soul , that I didn 't come to Corinth to spare you .
not that we have lordship over your faith , but are fellow workers with you for your joy . for you stand firm in faith .
but I determined this for myself , that I would not come to you again in sorrow .
for if I make you sorry , then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me ?
sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many ;
so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him , lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow .
for to this end I also wrote , that I might know the proof of you , whether you are obedient in all things .
now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything . for if indeed I have forgiven anything , I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ ,
that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan ; for we are not ignorant of his schemes .
now thanks be to God , who always leads us in triumph in Christ , and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place .
for we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God , in those who are saved , and in those who perish ;
to the one a stench from death to death ; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life . who is sufficient for these things ?
are we beginning again to commend ourselves ? or do we need , as do some , letters of commendation to you or from you ?
you are our letter , written in our hearts , known and read by all men ;
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
not that we are sufficient of ourselves , to account anything as from ourselves ; but our sufficiency is from God ;
who also made us sufficient as servants of a new Covenant ; not of the letter , but of the Spirit . for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
for most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect , by reason of the glory that surpasses .
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel wouldn 't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away .
but their minds were hardened , for until this very day at the reading of the old Covenant the same veil remains , because in Christ it passes away .
therefore seeing we have this ministry , even as we obtained mercy , we don 't faint .
even if our Good News is veiled , it is veiled in those who perish ;
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
but we have this treasure in clay vessels , that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God , and not from ourselves .
always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus , that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body .
for we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh .
but having the same spirit of faith , according to that which is written , " I believed , and therefore I spoke . " we also believe , and therefore also we speak ;
for all things are for your sakes , that the grace , being multiplied through the many , may cause the Thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God .
while we don 't look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal .
for we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal , in the heavens .
for most certainly in this we groan , longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven ;
if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked .
for indeed we who are in this tent do groan , being burdened ; not that we desire to be unclothed , but that we desire to be clothed , that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
now he who made us for this very thing is God , who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit .
therefore we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord ;
we are courageous , I say , and are willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be at home with the Lord .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
knowing therefore the fear of the Lord , we persuade men , but we are revealed to God ; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences .
for if we are beside ourselves , it is for God . or if we are of sober mind , it is for you .
therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on . even though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now we know him so no more .
therefore if anyone is in Christ , he is a new creation . the old things have passed away . behold , all things have become new .
but all things are of God , who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ , and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
we are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ , as though God were entreating by us : we beg you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God .
for he says , " At an acceptable time I listened to you , in a day of salvation I helped you . " behold , now is the acceptable time . behold , now is the day of salvation .
we give no occasion of stumbling in anything , that our service may not be blamed ,
Don 't be unequally yoked with unbelievers , for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity ? or what fellowship has light with darkness ?
open your hearts to us . we wronged no one . we corrupted no one . we took advantage of no one .
great is my boldness of speech toward you . great is my boasting on your behalf . I am filled with comfort . I overflow with joy in all our affliction .
for even when we had come into Macedonia , our flesh had no relief , but we were afflicted on every side . Fightings were outside . fear was inside .
therefore we have been comforted . in our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by you all .
for according to their power , I testify , yes and beyond their power , they gave of their own accord ,
begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints .
this was not as we had hoped , but first they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us through the will of God .
so we urged Titus , that as he made a beginning before , so he would also complete in you this grace .
I speak not by way of commandment , but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love .
for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
I give a judgment in this : for this is expedient for you , who were the first to start a year ago , not only to do , but also to be willing .
but now complete the doing also , that as there was the readiness to be willing , so there may be the completion also out of your ability .
for if the readiness is there , it is acceptable according to what you have , not according to what you don 't have .
but thanks be to God , who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus .
we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies .
we are avoiding this , that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us .
having regard for honorable things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies , and of our boasting on your behalf .
it is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints ,
but I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect , that , just as I said , you may be prepared ,
so that I won 't by any means , if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared , we ( to say nothing of you ) should be disappointed in this confident boasting .
remember this : he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly . he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully .
let each man give according as he has determined in his heart ; not grudgingly , or under compulsion ; for God loves a cheerful giver .
now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food , supply and multiply your seed for sowing , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ;
for this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints , but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God ;
while they themselves also , with supplication on your behalf , yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you .
for though we walk in the flesh , we don 't wage war according to the flesh ;
for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh , but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds ,
throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God , and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ ;
for though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be disappointed ,
that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters .
for , " His letters , " they say , " are weighty and strong , but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech is despised . "
let such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when we are absent , such are we also in deed when we are present .
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
for we don 't stretch ourselves too much , as though we didn 't reach to you . for we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ ,
not boasting beyond proper limits in other men 's labors , but having hope that as your faith grows , we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence ,
so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you , not to boast in what someone else has already done .
I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness , but indeed you do bear with me .
for I am Jealous over you with a godly jealousy . for I married you to one husband , that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ .
but I am afraid that somehow , as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness , so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
but though I am unskilled in speech , yet I am not unskilled in knowledge . no , in every way we have been revealed to you in all things .
or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted , because I preached to you God 's Good News free of charge ?
as the truth of Christ is in me , no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they boast , they may be found even as we .
it is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness , whose end will be according to their works .
that which I speak , I don 't speak according to the Lord , but as in foolishness , in this confidence of boasting .
for you bear with a man , if he brings you into bondage , if he devours you , if he takes you captive , if he exalts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
three times I was beaten with rods . once I was stoned . three times I suffered shipwreck . I have been a night and a day in the deep .
besides those things that are outside , there is that which presses on me daily , anxiety for all the assemblies .
who is weak , and I am not weak ? who is caused to stumble , and I don 't burn with indignation ?
if I must boast , I will boast of the things that concern my weakness .
the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ , he who is blessed forevermore , knows that I don 't lie .
it is doubtless not profitable for me to boast . for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
on behalf of such a one I will boast , but on my own behalf I will not boast , except in my weaknesses .
concerning this thing , I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me .
therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses , in injuries , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses , for Christ 's sake . for when I am weak , then am I strong .
truly the signs of an Apostle were worked among you in all patience , in signs and wonders and mighty works .
for what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this wrong .
but be it so , I did not myself burden you . but , being crafty , I caught you with deception .
did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you ?
I exhorted Titus , and I sent the brother with him . did Titus take any advantage of you ? Didn 't we walk in the same spirit ? Didn 't we walk in the same steps ?
again , do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you ? in the sight of God we speak in Christ . but all things , beloved , are for your edifying .
this is the third time I am coming to you . " at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established . "
seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me ; who toward you is not weak , but is powerful in you .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don 't you know as to your own selves , that Jesus Christ is in you ? --unless indeed you are disqualified .
but I hope that you will know that we aren 't disqualified .
now I pray to God that you do no evil ; not that we may appear approved , but that you may do that which is honorable , though we are as reprobate .
for we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong . and this we also pray for , even your perfecting .
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit , be with you all . Amen .
who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us out of this present evil age , according to the will of our God and Father--
I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different " good news " ;
and there isn 't another " good news . " only there are some who trouble you , and want to pervert the Good News of Christ .
but even though we , or an angel from heaven , should preach to you any " good news " other than that which we preached to you , let him be Cursed .
as we have said before , so I now say again : if any man preaches to you any " good news " other than that which you received , let him be Cursed .
but I make known to you , brothers , concerning the Good News which was preached by me , that it is not according to man .
for neither did I receive it from man , nor was I taught it , but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ .
for you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God , and ravaged it .
I advanced in the Jews ' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen , being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers .
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me , but I went away into Arabia . then I returned to Damascus .
but of the other Apostles I saw no one , except James , the Lord 's brother .
now about the things which I write to you , behold , before God , I 'm not lying .
I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ ,
then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking Titus also with me .
but not even Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised .
to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection , not for an hour , that the truth of the Good News might continue with you .
but to the contrary , when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision , even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision
and the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy ; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy .
but if , while we sought to be justified in Christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is Christ a servant of sin ? certainly not !
for if I build up again those things which I destroyed , I prove myself a law @-@ breaker .
for I , through the law , died to the law , that I might live to God .
foolish Galatians , who has bewitched you not to obey the truth , before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as crucified ?
I just want to learn this from you . did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by hearing of faith ?
he therefore who supplies the Spirit to you , and works miracles among you , does he do it by the works of the law , or by hearing of faith ?
the Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham , saying , " In you all the nations will be blessed . "
now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident , for , " The righteous will live by faith . "
brothers , speaking of human terms , though it is only a man 's Covenant , yet when it has been confirmed , no one makes it void , or adds to it .
for if the inheritance is of the law , it is no more of promise ; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise .
is the law then against the promises of God ? certainly not ! for if there had been a law given which could make alive , most certainly righteousness would have been of the law .
but before faith came , we were kept in custody under the law , confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
so that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
for as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
there is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free man , there is neither male nor female ; for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
but I say that so long as the heir is a child , he is no different from a bondservant , though he is lord of all ;
and because you are children , God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , crying , " ABBA , Father ! "
so you are no longer a bondservant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir of God through Christ .
but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time .
what was the blessing you enjoyed ? for I testify to you that , if possible , you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
but it is always good to be zealous in a good cause , and not only when I am present with you .
but I could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone , for I am perplexed about you .
for it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the handmaid , and one by the free woman .
however , the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh , but the son by the free woman was born through promise .
for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia , and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now , for she is in bondage with her children .
but the Jerusalem that is above is free , which is the mother of us all .
but as then , he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , so also it is now .
stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free , and don 't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage .
yes , I testify again to every man who receives circumcision , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
you are alienated from Christ , you who desire to be justified by the law . you have fallen away from grace .
you were running well ! who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth ?
I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way . but he who troubles you will bear his judgment , whoever he is .
for you , brothers , were called for freedom . only don 't use your freedom for gain to the flesh , but through love be servants to one another .
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word , in this : " you shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
but if you bite and devour one another , be careful that you don 't consume one another .
but if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
but the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , Goodness , faith ,
if we live by the Spirit , let 's also walk by the Spirit .
for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
but let each man test his own work , and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor .
but let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches .
Don 't be deceived . God is not mocked , for whatever a man sows , that he will also reap .
for he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption . but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
let us not be weary in doing good , for we will reap in due season , if we don 't give up .
so then , as we have opportunity , let 's do what is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
as many as desire to look good in the flesh , they compel you to be circumcised ; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
for even they who receive circumcision don 't keep the law themselves , but they desire to have you circumcised , that they may boast in your flesh .
but far be it from me to boast , except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
for in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creation .
as many as walk by this rule , peace and mercy be on them , and on God 's Israel .
from now on , let no one cause me any trouble , for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body .
Paul , an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , to the saints who are at Ephesus , and the faithful in Christ Jesus :
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ ;
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love ;
making known to us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
to an administration of the fullness of the times , to sum up all things in Christ , the things in the heavens , and the things on the earth , in him ;
in whom also we were assigned an inheritance , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ;
to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory , we who had before hoped in Christ :
in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Good News of your salvation--in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise ,
who is a pledge of our inheritance , to the redemption of God 's own possession , to the praise of his glory .
for this cause I also , having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you , and the love which you have toward all the saints ,
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ;
but God , being rich in mercy , for his great love with which he loved us ,
and raised us up with him , and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus ,
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus ;
for by grace you have been saved through faith , and that not of yourselves ; it is the gift of God ,
for we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God prepared before that we would walk in them .
that you were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
he came and preached peace to you who were far off and to those who were near .
for through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father .
so then you are no longer strangers and foreigners , but you are fellow citizens with the saints , and of the household of God ,
if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you ;
how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me , as I wrote before in few words ,
by which , when you read , you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ ;
which in other generations was not made known to the children of men , as it has now been revealed to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit ;
that the Gentiles are fellow heirs , and fellow members of the body , and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News ,
of which I was made a servant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places ,
now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that works in us ,
I therefore , the prisoner in the Lord , beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called ,
but to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
he gave some to be Apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , Evangelists ; and some , shepherds and teachers ;
for the perfecting of the saints , to the work of serving , to the building up of the body of Christ ;
but speaking truth in love , we may grow up in all things into him , who is the head , Christ ;
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk , in the futility of their mind ,
being darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their hearts ;
if indeed you heard him , and were taught in him , even as truth is in Jesus :
that you put away , as concerning your former way of life , the old man , that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit ;
and put on the new man , who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth .
" be angry , and don 't sin . " Don 't let the sun go down on your wrath ,
let him who stole steal no more ; but rather let him labor , working with his hands the thing that is good , that he may have something to give to him who has need .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
Don 't grieve the Holy Spirit of God , in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
walk in love , even as Christ also loved you , and gave himself up for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet @-@ smelling fragrance .
but sexual immorality , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not even be mentioned among you , as becomes saints ;
know this for sure , that no sexually immoral person , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God .
let no one deceive you with empty words . for because of these things , the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience .
for you were once darkness , but are now light in the Lord . walk as children of light ,
for the things which are done by them in secret , it is a shame even to speak of .
but all things , when they are reproved , are revealed by the light , for everything that reveals is light .
speaking to one another in psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs ; singing , and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to God , even the Father ;
for the husband is the head of the wife , and Christ also is the head of the assembly , being himself the Savior of the body .
but as the assembly is subject to Christ , so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything .
even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies . he who loves his own wife loves himself .
because we are members of his body , of his flesh and bones .
" for this cause a man will leave his father and mother , and will be joined to his wife . the two will become one flesh . "
nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself ; and let the wife see that she respects her husband .
" honor your father and mother , " which is the first commandment with a promise :
you fathers , don 't provoke your children to wrath , but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord .
servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as to Christ ;
not in the way of service only when eyes are on you , as men pleasers ; but as servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart ;
knowing that whatever good thing each one does , he will receive the same again from the Lord , whether he is bound or free .
you masters , do the same things to them , and give up threatening , knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is no partiality with him .
finally , be strong in the Lord , and in the strength of his might .
put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
therefore put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to withstand in the evil day , and , having done all , to stand .
above all , taking up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one .
and take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God ;
on my behalf , that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth , to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News ,
for which I am an ambassador in chains ; that in it I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
but that you also may know my affairs , how I am doing , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ;
whom I have sent to you for this very purpose , that you may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts .
peace be to the brothers , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Paul and Timothy , servants of Jesus Christ ; To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi , with the overseers and servants :
grace to you , and peace from God , our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
being confident of this very thing , that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ .
for God is my witness , how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus .
now I desire to have you know , brothers , that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News ;
so that it became evident to the whole palace guard , and to all the rest , that my bonds are in Christ ;
and that most of the brothers in the Lord , being confident through my bonds , are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear .
some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife , and some also out of good will .
the former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition , thinking that they add affliction to my chains ;
what does it matter ? only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed . I rejoice in this , yes , and will rejoice .
for I know that this will turn out to my salvation , through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
but if I live on in the flesh , this will bring fruit from my work ; yet I don 't know what I will choose .
but I am in a dilemma between the two , having the desire to depart and be with Christ , which is far better .
yet , to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake .
having this confidence , I know that I will remain , yes , and remain with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
each of you not just looking to his own things , but each of you also to the things of others .
but emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being made in the likeness of men .
so then , my beloved , even as you have always obeyed , not only in my presence , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
yes , and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice , and rejoice with you all .
but I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing .
for I have no one else like @-@ minded , who will truly care about you .
therefore I hope to send him at once , as soon as I see how it will go with me .
since he longed for you all , and was very troubled , because you had heard that he was sick .
for indeed he was sick , nearly to death , but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sorrow on sorrow .
I have sent him therefore the more diligently , that , when you see him again , you may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
because for the work of Christ he came near to death , risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me .
finally , my brothers , rejoice in the Lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not tiresome , but for you it is safe .
for we are the circumcision , who worship God in the Spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh ;
though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh . if any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh , I yet more :
circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; concerning the law , a Pharisee ;
nevertheless , to the extent that we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule . let us be of the same mind .
brothers , be imitators together of me , and note those who walk this way , even as you have us for an example .
for many walk , of whom I told you often , and now tell you even weeping , as the enemies of the cross of Christ ,
whose end is destruction , whose god is the belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who think about earthly things .
for our citizenship is in heaven , from where we also wait for a Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ;
who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
let your gentleness be known to all men . the Lord is at hand .
in nothing be anxious , but in everything , by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving , let your requests be made known to God .
and the peace of God , which surpasses all understanding , will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus .
but I rejoice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revived your thought for me ; in which you did indeed take thought , but you lacked opportunity .
not that I speak in respect to lack , for I have learned in whatever state I am , to be content in it .
you yourselves also know , you Philippians , that in the beginning of the Good News , when I departed from Macedonia , no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only .
not that I seek for the gift , but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account .
having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which you have toward all the saints ,
even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant , who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf ,
that you may walk worthily of the Lord , to please him in all respects , bearing fruit in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
strengthened with all power , according to the might of his glory , for all endurance and perseverance with joy ;
giving thanks to the Father , who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light ;
who delivered us out of the power of darkness , and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love ;
in whom we have our redemption , the forgiveness of our sins ;
for by him all things were created , in the heavens and on the earth , things visible and things invisible , whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and for him .
he is the head of the body , the assembly , who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he might have the preeminence .
and through him to reconcile all things to himself , by him , whether things on the earth , or things in the heavens , having made peace through the blood of his cross .
you , being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works ,
now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body 's sake , which is the assembly ;
whom we proclaim , admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus ;
for I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you , and for those at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ;
for though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejoicing and seeing your order , and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ .
rooted and built up in him , and established in the faith , even as you were taught , abounding in it in Thanksgiving .
be careful that you don 't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the elements of the world , and not after Christ .
in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ ;
having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
you were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh . he made you alive together with him , having forgiven us all our trespasses ,
wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us ; and he has taken it out of the way , nailing it to the cross ;
having stripped the principalities and the powers , he made a show of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
let no one therefore judge you in eating , or in drinking , or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day ,
which are a shadow of the things to come ; but the body is Christ 's .
if then you were raised together with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is , seated on the right hand of God .
set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are on the earth .
when Christ , our life , is revealed , then you will also be revealed with him in glory .
put to death therefore your members which are on the earth : sexual immorality , uncleanness , depraved passion , evil desire , and covetousness , which is idolatry ;
for which things ' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience .
Don 't lie to one another , seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings ,
and have put on the new man , who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator ,
put on therefore , as God 's chosen ones , holy and beloved , a heart of compassion , kindness , lowliness , humility , and perseverance ;
bearing with one another , and forgiving each other , if any man has a complaint against any ; even as Christ forgave you , so you also do .
and let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to which also you were called in one body ; and be thankful .
fathers , don 't provoke your children , so that they won 't be discouraged .
servants , obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh , not just when they are looking , as men pleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing God .
and whatever you do , work heartily , as for the Lord , and not for men ,
but he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done , and there is no partiality .
Masters , give to your servants that which is just and equal , knowing that you also have a Master in heaven .
praying together for us also , that God may open to us a door for the word , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds ;
all my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus , the beloved brother , faithful servant , and fellow bondservant in the Lord .
I am sending him to you for this very purpose , that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts ,
together with Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they will make known to you everything that is going on here .
for I testify about him , that he has great zeal for you , and for those in Laodicea , and for those in Hierapolis .
greet the brothers who are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the assembly that is in his house .
when this letter has been read among you , cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans ; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea .
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
you became imitators of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Spirit ,
so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia .
for from you the word of the Lord has been declared , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out ; so that we need not to say anything .
but having suffered before and been shamefully treated , as you know , at Philippi , we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict .
but even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News , so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , who tests our hearts .
for neither were we at any time found using words of flattery , as you know , nor a cloak of covetousness ( God is witness ) ,
nor seeking glory from men ( neither from you nor from others ) , when we might have claimed authority as Apostles of Christ .
even so , affectionately longing for you , we were well pleased to impart to you , not the Good News of God only , but also our own souls , because you had become very dear to us .
for you remember , brothers , our labor and travail ; for working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we preached to you the Good News of God .
as you know , we exhorted , comforted , and implored every one of you , as a father does his own children ,
for what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? Isn 't it even you , before our Lord Jesus at his coming ?
for most certainly , when we were with you , we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction , even as it happened , and you know .
for what Thanksgiving can we render again to God for you , for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God ;
night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face , and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
now may our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way to you ;
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints .
for this is the will of God : your sanctification , that you abstain from sexual immorality ,
that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter ; because the Lord is an avenger in all these things , as also we forewarned you and testified .
therefore he who rejects this doesn 't reject man , but God , who has also given his Holy Spirit to you .
but concerning brotherly love , you have no need that one write to you . for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another ,
for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia . but we exhort you , brothers , that you abound more and more ;
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
but we don 't want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen asleep , so that you don 't grieve like the rest , who have no hope .
for this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep .
for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the Archangel , and with God 's trumpet . the dead in Christ will rise first ,
but concerning the times and the seasons , brothers , you have no need that anything be written to you .
for when they are saying , " Peace and safety , " then sudden destruction will come on them , like birth pains on a pregnant woman ; and they will in no way escape .
you are all children of light , and children of the day . we don 't belong to the night , nor to darkness ,
so then let 's not sleep , as the rest do , but let 's watch and be sober .
for those who sleep , sleep in the night , and those who are drunk are drunk in the night .
but let us , since we belong to the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love , and , for a helmet , the hope of salvation .
but we beg you , brothers , to know those who labor among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ,
see that no one returns evil for evil to anyone , but always follow after that which is good , for one another , and for all .
I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers .
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ :
we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith grows exceedingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds ;
so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure .
this is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God , to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God , for which you also suffer .
let no one deceive you in any way . for it will not be , unless the departure comes first , and the man of sin is revealed , the son of destruction ,
Don 't you remember that , when I was still with you , I told you these things ?
now you know what is restraining him , to the end that he may be revealed in his own season .
then the lawless one will be revealed , whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth , and destroy by the manifestation of his coming ;
to which he called you through our Good News , for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
so then , brothers , stand firm , and hold the traditions which you were taught by us , whether by word , or by letter .
finally , brothers , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified , even as also with you ;
but the Lord is faithful , who will establish you , and guard you from the evil one .
we have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you both do and will do the things we command .
May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patience of Christ .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in labor and travail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
not because we don 't have the right , but to make ourselves an example to you , that you should imitate us .
for even when we were with you , we commanded you this : " if anyone will not work , neither let him eat . "
for we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion , who don 't work at all , but are busybodies .
now those who are that way , we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
but you , brothers , don 't be weary in doing well .
if any man doesn 't obey our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be ashamed .
the greeting of me , Paul , with my own hand , which is the sign in every letter : this is how I write .
but the goal of this command is love , out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith ;
from which things some , having missed the mark , have turned aside to vain talking ;
desiring to be teachers of the law , though they understand neither what they say , nor about what they strongly affirm .
according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
and I thank him who enabled me , Christ Jesus our Lord , because he counted me faithful , appointing me to service ;
now to the King eternal , Immortal , invisible , to God who alone is wise , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I delivered to Satan , that they might be taught not to blaspheme .
who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth .
to which I was appointed a preacher and an Apostle ( I am telling the truth in Christ , not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
but I don 't permit a woman to teach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in quietness .
for Adam was first formed , then Eve .
but she will be saved through her childbearing , if they continue in faith , love , and sanctification with sobriety .
( but if a man doesn 't know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
for those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
if you instruct the brothers of these things , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , nourished in the words of the faith , and of the good doctrine which you have followed .
for bodily exercise has some value , but godliness has value in all things , having the promise of the life which is now , and of that which is to come .
for to this end we both labor and suffer reproach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
let no man despise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity .
Don 't neglect the gift that is in you , which was given to you by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the elders .
be diligent in these things . give yourself wholly to them , that your progress may be revealed to all .
pay attention to yourself , and to your teaching . continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
Don 't rebuke an older man , but exhort him as a father ; the younger men as brothers ;
but if anyone doesn 't provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
besides , they also learn to be idle , going about from house to house . not only idle , but also gossips and busybodies , saying things which they ought not .
if any man or woman who believes has widows , let them relieve them , and don 't let the assembly be burdened ; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed .
let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching .
for the Scripture says , " You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain . " and , " The laborer is worthy of his wages . "
those who sin , reprove in the sight of all , that the rest also may be in fear .
I command you in the sight of God , and Christ Jesus , and the chosen angels , that you observe these things without prejudice , doing nothing by partiality .
in the same way also there are good works that are obvious , and those that are otherwise can 't be hidden .
let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed .
but having food and clothing , we will be content with that .
but those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts , such as drown men in ruin and destruction .
for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . some have been led astray from the faith in their greed , and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
fight the good fight of faith . lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called , and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses .
that they do good , that they be rich in good works , that they be ready to distribute , willing to communicate ;
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold of eternal life .
I thank God , whom I serve as my forefathers did , with a pure conscience . how unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions , night and day
longing to see you , remembering your tears , that I may be filled with joy ;
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lois , and your mother Eunice , and , I am persuaded , in you also .
for this cause , I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
for God didn 't give us a spirit of fear , but of power , love , and self @-@ control .
therefore don 't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner ; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God ,
for this , I was appointed as a preacher , an Apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
that good thing which was committed to you , guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us .
this you know , that all who are in Asia turned away from me ; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes .
( the Lord grant to him to find the Lord 's mercy in that day ) ; and in how many things he served at Ephesus , you know very well .
you therefore , my child , be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to faithful men , who will be able to teach others also .
no soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life , that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier .
remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , of the seed of David , according to my Good News ,
remind them of these things , charging them in the sight of the Lord , that they don 't argue about words , to no profit , to the subverting of those who hear .
give diligence to present yourself approved by God , a workman who doesn 't need to be ashamed , properly handling the Word of Truth .
men who have erred concerning the truth , saying that the resurrection is already past , and overthrowing the faith of some .
now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of clay . some are for honor , and some for dishonor .
flee from youthful lusts ; but pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
and they may recover themselves out of the devil 's snare , having been taken captive by him to his will .
traitors , headstrong , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ;
even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so do these also oppose the truth ; men corrupted in mind , who concerning the faith , are rejected .
but they will proceed no further . for their Folly will be evident to all men , as theirs also came to be .
for the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine , but , having itching ears , will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts ;
and will turn away their ears from the truth , and turn aside to fables .
I have fought the good fight . I have finished the course . I have kept the faith .
for Demas left me , having loved this present world , and went to Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia .
only Luke is with me . take Mark , and bring him with you , for he is useful to me for service .
bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come , and the books , especially the parchments .
Alexander , the coppersmith , did much evil to me . the Lord will repay him according to his works ,
at my first defense , no one came to help me , but all left me . May it not be held against them .
but the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gentiles might hear ; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior ;
to Titus , my true child according to a common faith : grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior .
I left you in Crete for this reason , that you would set in order the things that were lacking , and appoint elders in every city , as I directed you ;
for the overseer must be blameless , as God 's steward ; not self @-@ pleasing , not easily angered , not given to wine , not violent , not greedy for dishonest gain ;
holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching , that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine , and to convict those who contradict him .
whose mouths must be stopped ; men who overthrow whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for dishonest gain 's sake .
and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior , not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine , teachers of that which is good ;
Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters , and to be well @-@ pleasing in all things ; not contradicting ;
not stealing , but showing all good fidelity ; that they may adorn the doctrine of God , our Savior , in all things .
who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify for himself a people for his own possession , zealous for good works .
to speak evil of no one , not to be contentious , to be gentle , showing all humility toward all men .
that , being justified by his grace , we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
send Zenas , the lawyer , and Apollos on their journey speedily , that nothing may be lacking for them .
Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , to Philemon , our beloved fellow worker ,
that the fellowship of your faith may become effective , in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus .
for we have much joy and comfort in your love , because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you , brother .
therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate ,
I am sending him back . therefore receive him , that is , my own heart ,
I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides ) .
having confidence in your obedience , I write to you , knowing that you will do even beyond what I say .
also , prepare a guest room for me , for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you .
Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , greets you ,
God , having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways ,
has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds .
having become so much better than the angels , as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have .
again , when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says , " Let all the angels of God worship him . "
but of the Son he says , " Your throne , O God , is forever and ever . the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom .
as a mantle , you will roll them up , and they will be changed ; but you are the same . your years will not fail . "
but which of the angels has he told at any time , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet ? "
Aren 't they all serving spirits , sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation ?
therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard , lest perhaps we drift away .
God also testifying with them , both by signs and wonders , by various works of power , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit , according to his own will ?
for he didn 't subject the world to come , of which we speak , to angels .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to glory , to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
saying , " I will declare your name to my brothers . in the midst of the Congregation I will sing your praise . "
for most certainly , he doesn 't give help to angels , but he gives help to the seed of Abraham .
for in that he himself has suffered being tempted , he is able to help those who are tempted .
for he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses , inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house .
Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken ,
but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house ; whose house we are , if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end .
therefore , even as the Holy Spirit says , " Today if you will hear his voice ,
therefore I was displeased with that generation , and said , ' They always err in their heart , but they didn 't know my ways ; '
beware , brothers , lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief , in falling away from the living God ;
for we have become partakers of Christ , if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end :
while it is said , " Today if you will hear his voice , don 't harden your hearts , as in the rebellion . "
for who , when they heard , rebelled ? no , didn 't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses ?
with whom was he displeased forty years ? Wasn 't it with those who sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ?
to whom did he swear that they wouldn 't enter into his rest , but to those who were disobedient ?
we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief .
let us fear therefore , lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest .
seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein , and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience ,
for he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works , as God did from his .
there is no creature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
having then a great high priest , who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold tightly to our confession .
let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy , and may find grace for help in time of need .
for every high priest , being taken from among men , is appointed for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins .
the high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray , because he himself is also surrounded with weakness .
so also Christ didn 't glorify himself to be made a high priest , but it was he who said to him , " You are my Son . today I have become your father . "
he , in the days of his flesh , having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his godly fear ,
having been made perfect , he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation ,
about him we have many words to say , and hard to interpret , seeing you have become dull of hearing .
for everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness , for he is a baby .
but solid food is for those who are full grown , who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil .
for the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receives blessing from God ;
but if it bears thorns and thistles , it is rejected and near being Cursed , whose end is to be burned .
but , beloved , we are persuaded of better things for you , and things that accompany salvation , even though we speak like this .
for God is not unrighteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them .
we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end ,
in this way God , being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , interposed with an oath ;
this hope we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil ;
where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us , having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek .
for this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of God Most High , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
now consider how great this man was , to whom even Abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth out of the best spoils .
but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham , and has blessed him who has the promises .
here people who die receive tithes , but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives .
we can say that through Abraham even Levi , who receives tithes , has paid tithes ,
for the priesthood being changed , there is of necessity a change made also in the law .
for he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe , from which no one has officiated at the altar .
( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a bringing in of a better hope , through which we draw near to God .
therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him , seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them .
for such a high priest was fitting for us : Holy , guiltless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
for every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices . therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer .
for if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law ;
but now he has obtained a more excellent ministry , by so much as he is also the mediator of a better Covenant , which on better promises has been given as law .
for if that first Covenant had been faultless , then no place would have been sought for a second .
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness . I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more . "
in that he says , " A new Covenant , " he has made the first old . but that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away .
now indeed even the first Covenant had ordinances of divine service , and an earthly sanctuary .
for a tabernacle was prepared . in the first part were the lampstand , the table , and the show bread ; which is called the Holy Place .
and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat , of which things we can 't speak now in detail .
but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the errors of the people .
the Holy Spirit is indicating this , that the way into the Holy Place wasn 't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing ;
which is a symbol of the present age , where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable , concerning the conscience , of making the worshipper perfect ;
nor yet through the blood of goats and calves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Place , having obtained eternal redemption .
for if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled , sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh :
for where a last will and testament is , there must of necessity be the death of him who made it .
for a will is in force where there has been death , for it is never in force while he who made it lives .
moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the same way with the blood .
according to the law , nearly everything is cleansed with blood , and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission .
it was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
for Christ hasn 't entered into holy places made with hands , which are representations of the true , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us ;
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own ,
or else wouldn 't they have ceased to be offered , because the worshippers , having been once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sins ?
for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins .
therefore when he comes into the world , he says , " sacrifice and offering you didn 't desire , but you prepared a body for me ;
previously saying , " sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn 't desire , neither had pleasure in them " ( those which are offered according to the law ) ,
then he has said , " behold , I have come to do your will . " he takes away the first , that he may establish the second ,
but he , when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
let 's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and having our body washed with pure water ,
let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering ; for he who promised is faithful .
not forsaking our own assembling together , as the custom of some is , but exhorting one another ; and so much the more , as you see the Day approaching .
for we know him who said , " vengeance belongs to me , " says the Lord , " I will repay . " again , " The Lord will judge his people . "
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
but remember the former days , in which , after you were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings ;
for you both had compassion on me in my chains , and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens .
but we are not of those who shrink back to destruction , but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul .
by faith , we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him .
by faith , Abraham , when he was called , obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance . he went out , not knowing where he went .
by faith , he lived as an alien in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , dwelling in tents , with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise .
for he looked for the city which has the foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
by faith , even Sarah herself received power to conceive , and she bore a child when she was past age , since she counted him faithful who had promised .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them and embraced them from afar , and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
for those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own .
if indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out , they would have had enough time to return .
by faith , Abraham , being tested , offered up Isaac . yes , he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son ;
concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead . Figuratively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead .
by faith , Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshiped , leaning on the top of his staff .
by faith , Joseph , when his end was near , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel ; and gave instructions concerning his bones .
by faith , Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
by faith , Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter ,
choosing rather to share ill treatment with God 's people , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time ;
by faith , he left Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
by faith , he kept the Passover , and the sprinkling of the blood , that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them .
by faith , they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land . when the Egyptians tried to do so , they were swallowed up .
by faith , Rahab the prostitute , didn 't perish with those who were disobedient , having received the spies in peace .
what more shall I say ? for the time would fail me if I told of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets ;
quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , from weakness were made strong , grew mighty in war , and caused foreign armies to flee .
( of whom the world was not worthy ) , wandering in deserts , mountains , caves , and the holes of the earth .
looking to Jesus , the author and perfecter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising its shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
for consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , that you don 't grow weary , fainting in your souls .
and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children , " My son , don 't take lightly the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when you are reproved by him ;
it is for discipline that you endure . God deals with you as with children , for what son is there whom his father doesn 't discipline ?
but if you are without discipline , of which all have been made partakers , then are you illegitimate , and not children .
for they indeed , for a few days , punished us as seemed good to them ; but he for our profit , that we may be partakers of his holiness .
all chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous ; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby .
therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees ,
looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and many be defiled by it ;
for they could not stand that which was commanded , " If even an animal touches the mountain , it shall be stoned " ;
this phrase , " Yet once more , " signifies the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that have been made , that those things which are not shaken may remain .
therefore , receiving a Kingdom that can 't be shaken , let us have grace , through which we serve God acceptably , with reverence and awe ,
Don 't forget to show hospitality to strangers , for in doing so , some have entertained angels without knowing it .
remember those who are in bonds , as bound with them ; and those who are ill @-@ treated , since you are also in the body .
let marriage be held in honor among all , and let the bed be undefiled : but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers .
be free from the love of money , content with such things as you have , for he has said , " I will in no way leave you , neither will I in any way forsake you . "
so that with good courage we say , " The Lord is my helper . I will not fear . what can man do to me ? "
remember your leaders , men who spoke to you the word of God , and considering the results of their conduct , imitate their faith .
for the bodies of those animals , whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned outside of the camp .
for we don 't have here an enduring city , but we seek that which is to come .
through him , then , let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name .
I strongly urge you to do this , that I may be restored to you sooner .
now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal Covenant , our Lord Jesus ,
make you complete in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
but I exhort you , brothers , endure the word of exhortation , for I have written to you in few words .
know that our brother Timothy has been freed , with whom , if he comes shortly , I will see you .
James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are in the dispersion : greetings .
but if any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all liberally and without reproach ; and it will be given to him .
but let him ask in faith , without any doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tossed .
but let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position ;
for the sun arises with the scorching wind , and Withers the grass , and the flower in it falls , and the beauty of its appearance perishes . so also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits .
but each one is tempted , when he is drawn away by his own lust , and enticed .
then the lust , when it has conceived , bears sin ; and the sin , when it is full grown , brings forth death .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom can be no variation , nor turning shadow .
of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth , that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures .
so , then , my beloved brothers , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , and slow to anger ;
for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror ;
for he sees himself , and goes away , and immediately forgets what kind of man he was .
if anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn 't bridle his tongue , but deceives his heart , this man 's religion is worthless .
pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this : to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep oneself unstained by the world .
however , if you fulfill the royal law , according to the Scripture , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself , " you do well .
so speak , and so do , as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom .
for judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy . mercy triumphs over judgment .
Wasn 't Abraham our father justified by works , in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar ?
you see then that by works , a man is justified , and not only by faith .
in the same way , wasn 't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works , in that she received the messengers , and sent them out another way ?
for as the body apart from the spirit is dead , even so faith apart from works is dead .
for in many things we all stumble . if anyone doesn 't stumble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also .
indeed , we put bits into the horses ' mouths so that they may obey us , and we guide their whole body .
behold , the ships also , though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds , are yet guided by a very small rudder , wherever the pilot desires .
and the tongue is a fire . the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Gehenna .
for every kind of animal , bird , creeping thing , and thing in the sea , is tamed , and has been tamed by mankind .
with it we bless our God and Father , and with it we curse men , who are made in the image of God .
out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing . my brothers , these things ought not to be so .
who is wise and understanding among you ? let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom .
but if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , don 't boast and don 't lie against the truth .
now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace .
where do wars and fightings among you come from ? Don 't they come from your pleasures that war in your members ?
you lust , and don 't have . you kill , covet , and can 't obtain . you fight and make war . you don 't have , because you don 't ask .
you ask , and don 't receive , because you ask with wrong motives , so that you may spend it for your pleasures .
you adulterers and adulteresses , don 't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . cleanse your hands , you sinners ; and purify your hearts , you double @-@ minded .
Lament , mourn , and weep . let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to gloom .
humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he will exalt you .
your gold and your silver are corroded , and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . you have laid up your treasure in the last days .
you have lived delicately on the earth , and taken your pleasure . you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter .
you have condemned , you have murdered the righteous one . he doesn 't resist you .
you also be patient . establish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is at hand .
Don 't grumble , brothers , against one another , so that you won 't be judged . behold , the judge stands at the door .
take , brothers , for an example of suffering and of patience , the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
is any among you sick ? let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ,
and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up . if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
confess your offenses to one another , and pray for one another , that you may be healed . the insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective .
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it didn 't rain on the earth for three years and six months .
Peter , an Apostle of Jesus Christ , to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the dispersion in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
Wherein you greatly rejoice , though now for a little while , if need be , you have been put to grief in various trials ,
whom not having known you love ; in whom , though now you don 't see him , yet believing , you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory--
therefore prepare your minds for action , be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ--
as children of obedience , not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance ,
but just as he who called you is holy , you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior ;
who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world , but was revealed at the end of times for your sake ,
who through him are believers in God , who raised him from the dead , and gave him glory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection , love one another from the heart fervently :
having been born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , through the word of God , which lives and remains forever .
if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious :
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
who in time past were no people , but now are God 's people , who had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
having good behavior among the nations , so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they see , glorify God in the day of visitation .
for this is the will of God , that by well @-@ doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
for to this you were called , because Christ also suffered for us , leaving you an example , that you should follow his steps ,
who , when he was Cursed , didn 't curse back . when he suffered , didn 't threaten , but committed himself to him who judges righteously ;
who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sins , might live to righteousness ; by whose stripes you were healed .
let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair , and of wearing jewels of gold , or of putting on fine clothing ;
but in the hidden person of the heart , in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God very precious .
for this is how the holy women before , who hoped in God also adorned themselves , being in subjection to their own husbands :
not rendering evil for evil , or insult for insult ; but instead blessing ; knowing that to this were you called , that you may inherit a blessing .
for , " He who would love life , and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil , and his lips from speaking deceit .
let him turn away from evil , and do good . let him seek peace , and pursue it .
for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous , and his ears open to their prayer ; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil . "
now who is he who will harm you , if you become imitators of that which is good ?
but even if you should suffer for righteousness ' sake , you are blessed . " Don 't fear what they fear , neither be troubled . "
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear :
for it is better , if it is God 's will , that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil .
Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same mind ; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ;
that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men , but for the will of God .
they think it is strange that you don 't run with them into the same excess of riot , blaspheming :
for to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead , that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh , but live as to God in the spirit .
but the end of all things is near . therefore be of sound mind , self @-@ controlled , and sober in prayer .
and above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves , for love covers a multitude of sins .
as each has received a gift , employ it in serving one another , as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms .
beloved , don 't be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you , to test you , as though a strange thing happened to you .
but because you are partakers of Christ 's sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy .
for let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil doer , or a meddler in other men 's matters .
but if one of you suffers for being a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God in this matter .
for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God . if it begins first with us , what will happen to those who don 't obey the Good News of God ?
" if it is hard for the righteous to be saved , what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner ? "
when the chief shepherd is revealed , you will receive the crown of glory that doesn 't fade away .
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time ;
be sober and self @-@ controlled . be watchful . your adversary , the devil , walks around like a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour .
withstand him steadfast in your faith , knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings .
but may the God of all grace , who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after you have suffered a little while , perfect , establish , strengthen , and settle you .
she who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , greets you ; and so does Mark , my son .
greet one another with a kiss of love . peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
Simon Peter , a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness , through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue ;
for if these things are yours and abound , they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
for he who lacks these things is blind , seeing only what is near , having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins .
for thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ .
I think it right , as long as I am in this tent , to stir you up by reminding you ;
knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly , even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me .
yes , I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure .
for we did not follow cunningly devised fables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
for no prophecy ever came by the will of man : but holy men of God spoke , being moved by the Holy Spirit .
many will follow their immoral ways , and as a result , the way of the truth will be maligned .
for if God didn 't spare angels when they sinned , but cast them down to Tartarus , and committed them to pits of darkness , to be reserved for judgment ;
and didn 't spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah with seven others , a preacher of righteousness , when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly ;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them to destruction , having made them an example to those who would live ungodly ;
( for that righteous man dwelling among them , was tormented in his righteous soul from day to day with seeing and hearing lawless deeds ) :
having eyes full of adultery , and who can 't cease from sin ; enticing unsettled souls ; having a heart trained in greed ; children of cursing ;
forsaking the right way , they went astray , having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages of wrongdoing ;
but he was rebuked for his own disobedience . a mute donkey spoke with a man 's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet .
these are wells without water , clouds driven by a storm ; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever .
for , uttering great swelling words of emptiness , they entice in the lusts of the flesh , by licentiousness , those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error ;
for if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
but it has happened to them according to the true proverb , " The dog turns to his own vomit again , " and " the sow that has washed to wallowing in the mire . "
this is now , beloved , the second letter that I have written to you ; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you ;
that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and the commandments of us , the Apostles of the Lord and Savior :
for this they willfully forget , that there were heavens from of old , and an earth formed out of water and amid water , by the word of God ;
by which means the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished .
but the heavens that now are , and the earth , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
but don 't forget this one thing , beloved , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
the Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slowness ; but is patient with us , not wishing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
but , according to his promise , we look for new heavens and a new earth , in which righteousness dwells .
therefore , beloved , seeing that you look for these things , be diligent to be found in peace , without blemish and blameless in his sight .
regard the patience of our Lord as salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also , according to the wisdom given to him , wrote to you ;
you therefore , beloved , knowing these things beforehand , beware , lest being carried away with the error of the wicked , you fall from your own steadfastness .
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Word of life
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fellowship with us . yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness , we lie , and don 't tell the truth .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ , his Son , cleanses us from all sin .
if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
if we confess our sins , he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
my little children , I write these things to you so that you may not sin . if anyone sins , we have a counselor with the Father , Jesus Christ , the righteous .
and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins , and not for ours only , but also for the whole world .
this is how we know that we know him : if we keep his commandments .
one who says , " I know him , " and doesn 't keep his commandments , is a liar , and the truth isn 't in him .
but whoever keeps his word , God 's love has most certainly been perfected in him . this is how we know that we are in him :
brothers , I write no new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you had from the beginning . the old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning .
again , I write a new commandment to you , which is true in him and in you ; because the darkness is passing away , and the true light already shines .
he who says he is in the light and hates his brother , is in the darkness even until now .
he who loves his brother remains in the light , and there is no occasion for stumbling in him .
but he who hates his brother is in the darkness , and walks in the darkness , and doesn 't know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
I write to you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
Don 't love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone loves the world , the Father 's love isn 't in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , isn 't the Father 's , but is the world 's .
little children , these are the end times , and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have arisen . by this we know that it is the final hour .
you have an anointing from the Holy One , and you all have knowledge .
I have not written to you because you don 't know the truth , but because you know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? this is the Antichrist , he who denies the Father and the Son .
whoever denies the Son , the same doesn 't have the Father . he who confesses the Son has the Father also .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the Father .
now , little children , remain in him , that when he appears , we may have boldness , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
behold , how great a love the Father has bestowed on us , that we should be called children of God ! for this cause the world doesn 't know us , because it didn 't know him .
you know that he was revealed to take away our sins , and in him is no sin .
whoever is born of God doesn 't commit sin , because his seed remains in him ; and he can 't sin , because he is born of God .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the devil . whoever doesn 't do righteousness is not of God , neither is he who doesn 't love his brother .
for this is the message which you heard from the beginning , that we should love one another ;
unlike Cain , who was of the evil one , and killed his brother . why did he kill him ? because his works were evil , and his brother 's righteous .
Don 't be surprised , my brothers , if the world hates you .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who doesn 't love his brother remains in death .
whoever hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him .
by this we know love , because he laid down his life for us . and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers .
but whoever has the world 's goods , and sees his brother in need , and closes his heart of compassion against him , how does the love of God remain in him ?
my little children , let 's not love in word only , neither with the tongue only , but in deed and truth .
this is his commandment , that we should believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love one another , even as he commanded .
he who keeps his commandments remains in him , and he in him . by this we know that he remains in us , by the Spirit which he gave us .
by this you know the Spirit of God : every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God ,
you are of God , little children , and have overcome them ; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world .
beloved , let us love one another , for love is of God ; and everyone who loves is born of God , and knows God .
he who doesn 't love doesn 't know God , for God is love .
by this God 's love was revealed in us , that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him .
in this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins .
no one has seen God at any time . if we love one another , God remains in us , and his love has been perfected in us .
by this we know that we remain in him and he in us , because he has given us of his Spirit .
we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world .
we know and have believed the love which God has for us . God is love , and he who remains in love remains in God , and God remains in him .
in this love has been made perfect among us , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment , because as he is , even so are we in this world .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love casts out fear , because fear has punishment . he who fears is not made perfect in love .
whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God . whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him .
by this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and keep his commandments .
for this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments . his commandments are not grievous .
for whatever is born of God overcomes the world . this is the victory that has overcome the world : your faith .
who is he who overcomes the world , but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
for there are three who testify :
the testimony is this , that God gave to us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
he who has the Son has the life . he who doesn 't have God 's Son doesn 't have the life .
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eternal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
this is the boldness which we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he listens to us .
and if we know that he listens to us , whatever we ask , we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him .
we know that whoever is born of God doesn 't sin , but he who was born of God keeps himself , and the evil one doesn 't touch him .
we know that we are of God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
the elder , to the chosen lady and her children , whom I love in truth ; and not I only , but also all those who know the truth ;
for the truth 's sake , which remains in us , and it will be with us forever :
grace , mercy , and peace will be with us , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth , even as we have been commanded by the Father .
now I beg you , dear lady , not as though I wrote to you a new commandment , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
this is love , that we should walk according to his commandments . this is the commandment , even as you heard from the beginning , that you should walk in it .
for many deceivers have gone out into the world , those who don 't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh . this is the deceiver and the Antichrist .
watch yourselves , that we don 't lose the things which we have accomplished , but that we receive a full reward .
whoever transgresses and doesn 't remain in the teaching of Christ , doesn 't have God . he who remains in the teaching , the same has both the Father and the Son .
if anyone comes to you , and doesn 't bring this teaching , don 't receive him into your house , and don 't welcome him ,
they have testified about your love before the assembly . you will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way worthy of God ,
we therefore ought to receive such , that we may be fellow workers for the truth .
I wrote to the assembly , but Diotrephes , who loves to be first among them , doesn 't accept what we say .
Demetrius has the testimony of all , and of the truth itself ; yes , we also testify , and you know that our testimony is true .
I had many things to write to you , but I am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen ;
Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to those who are called , sanctified by God the Father , and kept for Jesus Christ :
now I desire to remind you , though you already know this , that the Lord , having saved a people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who didn 't believe .
angels who didn 't keep their first domain , but deserted their own dwelling place , he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day .
but these speak evil of whatever things they don 't know . what they understand naturally , like the creatures without reason , they are destroyed in these things .
Woe to them ! for they went in the way of Cain , and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire , and perished in Korah 's rebellion .
these are murmurers and complainers , walking after their lusts ( and their mouth speaks proud things ) , showing respect of persons to gain advantage .
but you , beloved , remember the words which have been spoken before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life .
who testified to God 's word , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , about everything that he saw .
blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy , and keep the things that are written in it , for the time is at hand .
behold , he is coming with the clouds , and every eye will see him , including those who pierced him . all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him . even so , Amen .
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and I heard behind me a loud voice , like a trumpet
saying , " What you see , write in a book and send to the seven assemblies : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and to Laodicea . "
his feet were like burnished brass , as if it had been refined in a furnace . his voice was like the voice of many waters .
he had seven stars in his right hand . out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two @-@ edged sword . his face was like the sun shining at its brightest .
when I saw him , I fell at his feet like a dead man . he laid his right hand on me , saying , " Don 't be afraid . I am the first and the last ,
and the Living one . I was dead , and behold , I am alive forevermore . Amen . I have the keys of Death and of Hades .
write therefore the things which you have seen , and the things which are , and the things which will happen hereafter ;
the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand , and the seven golden lampstands . the seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies . the seven lampstands are seven assemblies .
" to the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write : " he who holds the seven stars in his right hand , he who walks among the seven golden lampstands says these things :
you have perseverance and have endured for my name 's sake , and have not grown weary .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . to him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Paradise of my God .
" to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write : " the first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life says these things :
" I know your works , oppression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . he who overcomes won 't be harmed by the second death .
" to the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write : " he who has the sharp two @-@ edged sword says these things :
repent therefore , or else I am coming to you quickly , and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth .
" to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write : " the Son of God , who has his eyes like a flame of fire , and his feet are like burnished brass , says these things :
" I know your works , your love , faith , service , patient endurance , and that your last works are more than the first .
behold , I will throw her into a bed , and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression , unless they repent of her works .
wake up , and keep the things that remain , which you were about to throw away , for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God .
nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments . they will walk with me in white , for they are worthy .
he who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments , and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life , and I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
because you kept my command to endure , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
I am coming quickly ! hold firmly that which you have , so that no one takes your crown .
" to the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write : " the Amen , the faithful and True Witness , the Head of God 's creation , says these things :
so , because you are lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I will vomit you out of my mouth .
he who overcomes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne , as I also overcame , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
immediately I was in the Spirit . behold , there was a throne set in heaven , and one sitting on the throne
around the throne were twenty @-@ four thrones . on the thrones were twenty @-@ four elders sitting , dressed in white garments , with crowns of gold on their heads .
out of the throne proceed lightnings , sounds , and thunders . there were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne , which are the seven spirits of God .
before the throne was something like a sea of glass , similar to crystal . in the midst of the throne , and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind .
the first creature was like a lion , and the second creature like a calf , and the third creature had a face like a man , and the fourth was like a flying eagle .
I saw , in the right hand of him who sat on the throne , a book written inside and outside , sealed shut with seven seals .
no one in heaven above , or on the earth , or under the earth , was able to open the book , or to look in it .
and I wept much , because no one was found worthy to open the book , or to look in it .
then he came , and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne .
I saw , and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne , the living creatures , and the elders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
saying with a loud voice , " worthy is the lamb who has been killed to receive the power , wealth , wisdom , strength , honor , glory , and blessing ! "
I saw that the lamb opened one of the seven seals , and I heard one of the four living creatures saying , as with a voice of Thunder , " Come and see ! "
and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it had a bow . a crown was given to him , and he came forth conquering , and to conquer .
I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , " A choenix of wheat for a denarius , and three choenix of barley for a denarius ! Don 't damage the oil and the wine ! "
when he opened the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God , and for the testimony of the lamb which they had .
I saw when he opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair , and the whole moon became as blood .
the stars of the sky fell to the earth , like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind .
the sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up . every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
after this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise , having the seal of the living God . he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea ,
saying , " Don 't harm the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads ! "
I heard the number of those who were sealed , one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel :
of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand , of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand , of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand ,
of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand , of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand , of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand ,
of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand , of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand , of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand ,
of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand , of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand , of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
they cried with a loud voice , saying , " salvation be to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the lamb ! "
all the angels were standing around the throne , the elders , and the four living creatures ; and they fell on their faces before his throne , and worshiped God ,
one of the elders answered , saying to me , " These who are arrayed in white robes , who are they , and from where did they come ? "
I told him , " My lord , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tribulation . they washed their robes , and made them white in the lamb 's blood .
therefore they are before the throne of God , they serve him day and night in his temple . he who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them .
they will never be hungry , neither thirsty any more ; neither will the sun beat on them , nor any heat ;
for the lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them , and leads them to springs of waters of life . and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
when he opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
the smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the saints , went up before God out of the angel 's hand .
the angel took the censer , and he filled it with the fire of the altar , and threw it on the earth . there followed thunders , sounds , lightnings , and an earthquake .
and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died . one third of the ships were destroyed .
the third angel sounded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the springs of the waters .
the name of the star is called " Wormwood . " one third of the waters became wormwood . many people died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth . the key to the pit of the abyss was given to him .
then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth , and power was given to them , as the Scorpions of the earth have power .
they were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree , but only those people who don 't have God 's seal on their foreheads .
they were given power not to kill them , but to torment them for five months . their torment was like the torment of a scorpion , when it strikes a person .
in those days people will seek death , and will in no way find it . they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war . on their heads were something like golden crowns , and their faces were like people 's faces .
they had hair like women 's hair , and their teeth were like those of lions .
they had breastplates , like breastplates of iron . the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots , or of many horses rushing to war .
they have tails like those of Scorpions , and stings . in their tails they have power to harm men for five months .
they have over them as king the angel of the abyss . his name in Hebrew is " Abaddon , " but in Greek , he has the name " Apollyon . "
the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million . I heard the number of them .
by these three plagues were one third of mankind killed : by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur , which proceeded out of their mouths .
for the power of the horses is in their mouths , and in their tails . for their tails are like Serpents , and have heads , and with them they harm .
they didn 't repent of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their sexual immorality , nor of their thefts .
the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky ,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the prophets .
the voice which I heard from heaven , again speaking with me , said , " Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as sweet as honey in my mouth . when I had eaten it , my stomach was made bitter .
a Reed like a rod was given to me . someone said , " Rise , and measure God 's temple , and the altar , and those who worship in it .
I will give power to my two witnesses , and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days , clothed in sackcloth . "
these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands , standing before the Lord of the earth .
if anyone desires to harm them , fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies . if anyone desires to harm them , he must be killed in this way .
when they have finished their testimony , the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them , and overcome them , and kill them .
their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
from among the peoples , tribes , languages , and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them , and they will be glad . they will give gifts to one another , because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth .
the seventh angel sounded , and great voices in heaven followed , saying , " The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ . he will reign forever and ever ! "
a great sign was seen in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and on her head a crown of twelve stars .
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his throne .
the woman fled into the wilderness , where she has a place prepared by God , that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days .
the great dragon was thrown down , the old serpent , he who is called the devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
they overcame him because of the lamb 's blood , and because of the word of their testimony . they didn 't love their life , even to death .
therefore rejoice , heavens , and you who dwell in them . Woe to the earth and to the sea , because the devil has gone down to you , having great wrath , knowing that he has but a short time . "
when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
the serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river , that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream .
the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth .
the dragon grew angry with the woman , and went away to make war with the rest of her seed , who keep God 's commandments and hold Jesus ' testimony .
then I stood on the sand of the sea . I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads . on his horns were ten crowns , and on his heads , blasphemous names .
the beast which I saw was like a Leopard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . the dragon gave him his power , his throne , and great authority .
a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him . authority to make war for forty @-@ two months was given to him .
he opened his mouth for blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name , and his dwelling , those who dwell in heaven .
it was given to him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them . authority over every tribe , people , language , and nation was given to him .
all who dwell on the earth will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb who has been killed .
if anyone is to go into captivity , he will go into captivity . if anyone is to be killed with the sword , he must be killed . here is the endurance and the faith of the saints .
he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence . he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
he performs great signs , even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people .
he causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the slave , to be given marks on their right hands , or on their foreheads ;
and that no one would be able to buy or to sell , unless he has that mark , the name of the beast or the number of his name .
here is wisdom . he who has understanding , let him calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man . his number is six hundred sixty @-@ six .
I heard a sound from heaven , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great Thunder . the sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps .
in their mouth was found no lie , for they are blameless .
the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name .
here is the patience of the saints , those who keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus . "
I looked , and behold , a white cloud ; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
he who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth , and the earth was reaped .
the winepress was trodden outside of the city , and blood came out from the winepress , even to the bridles of the horses , as far as one thousand six hundred stadia .
after these things I looked , and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened .
the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out , clothed with pure , bright linen , and wearing golden sashes around their breasts .
one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temple , until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished .
I heard a loud voice out of the temple , saying to the seven angels , " Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth ! "
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshiped his image .
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
I heard the angel of the waters saying , " You are righteous , who are and who were , you Holy One , because you have judged these things .
for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets , and you have given them blood to drink . they deserve this . "
the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was given to him to scorch men with fire .
people were scorched with great heat , and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues . they didn 't repent and give him glory .
the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was darkened . they gnawed their tongues because of the pain ,
and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores . they didn 't repent of their works .
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , something like frogs ;
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
" behold , I come like a thief . blessed is he who watches , and keeps his clothes , so that he doesn 't walk naked , and they see his shame . "
the seventh poured out his bowl into the air . a loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , " It is done ! "
there were lightnings , sounds , and thunders ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since there were men on the earth , so great an earthquake , so mighty .
one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me , saying , " Come here . I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters ,
with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality , and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality . "
the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth .
and on her forehead a name was written , " mystery , BABYLON the great , the mother of the prostitutes and of the ABOMINATIONS of the Earth . "
I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . when I saw her , I wondered with great amazement .
the angel said to me , " Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
they are seven kings . five have fallen , the one is , the other has not yet come . when he comes , he must continue a little while .
the beast that was , and is not , is himself also an eighth , and is of the seven ; and he goes to destruction .
the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet , but they receive authority as kings , with the beast , for one hour .
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the prostitute , and will make her desolate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
the woman whom you saw is the great city , which reigns over the kings of the earth . "
after these things , I saw another angel coming down out of the sky , having great authority . the earth was illuminated with his glory .
for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality , the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury . "
I heard another voice from heaven , saying , " Come out of her , my people , that you have no participation in her sins , and that you don 't receive of her plagues ,
return to her just as she returned , and repay her double as she did , and according to her works . in the cup which she mixed , mix to her double .
therefore in one day her plagues will come : death , mourning , and famine ; and she will be utterly burned with fire ; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong .
the kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her , will weep and wail over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
standing far away for the fear of her torment , saying , ' Woe , woe , the great city , Babylon , the strong city ! for your judgment has come in one hour . '
the fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you , and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you , and you will find them no more at all .
the merchants of these things , who were made rich by her , will stand far away for the fear of her torment , weeping and mourning ;
in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints , and of all who have been slain on the earth . "
for true and righteous are his judgments . for he has judged the great prostitute , who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality , and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
the twenty @-@ four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne , saying , " Amen ! Hallelujah ! "
a voice came forth from the throne , saying , " Give praise to our God , all you his servants , you who fear him , the small and the great ! "
let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad , and let us give the glory to him . for the marriage of the lamb has come , and his wife has made herself ready . "
it was given to her that she would array herself in bright , pure , fine linen : for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints .
I saw the heaven opened , and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it is called faithful and True . in righteousness he judges and makes war .
his eyes are a flame of fire , and on his head are many crowns . he has names written and a name written which no one knows but he himself .
he is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood . his name is called " The Word of God . "
he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written , " King of Kings , and Lord of lords . "
I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse , and against his army .
I saw an angel coming down out of heaven , having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand .
he seized the dragon , the old serpent , which is the devil and Satan , who deceives the whole inhabited earth , and bound him for a thousand years ,
the rest of the dead didn 't live until the thousand years were finished . this is the first resurrection .
and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to the war ; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
they went up over the breadth of the earth , and surrounded the camp of the saints , and the beloved city . fire came down out of heaven from God , and devoured them .
the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet are also . they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
I saw a great white throne , and him who sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away . there was found no place for them .
the sea gave up the dead who were in it . death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them . they were judged , each one according to his works .
death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . this is the second death , the lake of fire .
if anyone was not found written in the book of life , he was cast into the lake of fire .
I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away , and the sea is no more .
I saw the holy city , New Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God , prepared like a bride adorned for her husband .
he will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes . death will be no more ; neither will there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain , any more . the first things have passed away . "
he who overcomes , I will give him these things . I will be his God , and he will be my son .
but for the cowardly , unbelieving , sinners , abominable , murderers , sexually immoral , sorcerers , idolaters , and all liars , their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur , which is the second death . "
on the east were three gates ; and on the north three gates ; and on the south three gates ; and on the west three gates .
he who spoke with me had for a measure , a golden Reed , to measure the city , its gates , and its walls .
the city lies foursquare , and its length is as great as its breadth . he measured the city with the Reed , Twelve thousand twelve stadia . its length , breadth , and height are equal .
its wall is one hundred forty @-@ four cubits , by the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
the construction of its wall was jasper . the city was pure gold , like pure glass .
the twelve gates were twelve pearls . each one of the gates was made of one pearl . the street of the city was pure gold , like transparent glass .
the city has no need for the sun , neither of the moon , to shine , for the very glory of God illuminated it , and its lamp is the lamb .
the nations will walk in its light . the kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it .
its gates will in no way be shut by day ( for there will be no night there ) ,
and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter .
he showed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb ,
there will be no curse any more . the throne of God and of the lamb will be in it , and his servants serve him .
they will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads .
" behold , I come quickly . blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book . "
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things .
" behold , I come quickly . my reward is with me , to repay to each man according to his work .
I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End .
blessed are those who do his commandments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
outside are the dogs , the sorcerers , the sexually immoral , the murderers , the idolaters , and everyone who loves and practices falsehood .
I , Jesus , have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies . I am the root and the offspring of David ; the bright and Morning Star . "
I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book , if anyone adds to them , may God add to him the plagues which are written in this book .
