and the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God created great whales , and every living creature that moveth , which the waters brought forth abundantly , after their kind , and every winged fowl after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
and God blessed them , and God said unto them , Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth , and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth .
and God said , behold , I have given you every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat .
and to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , I have given every green herb for meat : and it was so .
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens ,
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grew : for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground .
and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden .
in the sweat of THY face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
so he drove out the man ; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims , and a flaming sword which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
behold , thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth ; and from THY face shall I be hid ; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that findeth me shall slay me .
and it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born unto them ,
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose .
and the Lord said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the creeping thing , and the fowls of the air ; for it repenteth me that I have made them .
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of : the length of the Ark shall be three hundred cubits , the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits .
a window shalt thou make to the Ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the Ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third stories shalt thou make it .
and , behold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die .
but with thee will I establish my Covenant ; and thou shalt come into the Ark , thou , and THY sons , and THY wife , and THY sons ' wives with thee .
and of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the Ark , to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep them alive .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
and Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him , into the Ark , because of the waters of the flood .
in the six hundredth year of Noah 's life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened .
in the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the Ark ;
they , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the Ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
and God remembered Noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that was with him in the Ark : and God made a wind to pass over the earth , and the waters asswaged ;
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
and the dove came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dried up from off the earth : and Noah removed the covering of the Ark , and looked , and , behold , the face of the ground was dry .
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth , and upon every fowl of the air , upon all that moveth upon the earth , and upon all the fishes of the sea ; into your hand are they delivered .
and surely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every beast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man .
and I will establish my Covenant with you ; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth .
and I will remember my Covenant , which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh ; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
and the bow shall be in the cloud ; and I will look upon it , that I may remember the everlasting Covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth .
and Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father 's nakedness .
and the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as thou comest to Gerar , unto Gaza ; as thou goest , unto Sodom , and Gomorrah , and Admah , and Zeboim , even unto Lasha .
and it came to pass , as they journeyed from the east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar ; and they dwelt there .
and they said , Go to , let us build us a city and a tower , whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let us make us a name , lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth .
and the Lord said , behold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they have imagined to do .
so the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they left off to build the city .
therefore is the name of it called Babel ; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth .
and Abram and Nahor took them wives : the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai ; and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah , and the father of Iscah .
and Terah took Abram his son , and lot the son of Haran his son 's son , and Sarai his daughter in law , his son Abram 's wife ; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Canaan ; and they came unto Haran , and dwelt there .
and Abram took Sarai his wife , and lot his brother 's son , and all their substance that they had gathered , and the souls that they had gotten in Haran ; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan ; and into the land of Canaan they came .
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel , and pitched his tent , having Bethel on the west , and Hai on the east : and there he builded an altar unto the Lord , and called upon the name of the Lord .
and there was a famine in the land : and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine was grievous in the land .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sarai his wife , behold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save thee alive .
why saidst thou , She is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold THY wife , take her , and go THY way .
and there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram 's cattle and the herdmen of lot 's cattle : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land .
is not the whole land before thee ? separate thyself , I pray thee , from me : if thou wilt take the left hand , then I will go to the right ; or if thou depart to the right hand , then I will go to the left .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew ; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eschol , and brother of Aner : and these were confederate with Abram .
and he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smote them , and pursued them unto Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer , and of the kings that were with him , at the valley of Shaveh , which is the king 's Dale .
and , behold , the word of the Lord came unto him , saying , This shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and Sarai Abram 's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian , after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife .
and the angel of the Lord said unto her , behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call his name Ishmael ; because the Lord hath heard THY affliction .
and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and THY seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting Covenant , to be a God unto thee , and to THY seed after thee .
and as for Ishmael , I have heard thee : behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation .
and Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham 's house ; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day , as God had said unto him .
and he lift up his eyes and looked , and , lo , three men stood by him : and when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bowed himself toward the ground ,
and there came two angels to Sodom at even ; and lot sat in the gate of Sodom : and lot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground ;
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and while he lingered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the Lord being merciful unto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
behold now , THY servant hath found grace in THY sight , and thou hast magnified THY mercy , which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life ; and I cannot escape to the mountain , lest some evil take me , and I die :
and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt .
and lot went up out of Zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he feared to dwell in Zoar : and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters .
and they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
and they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger arose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
and it came to pass , when God caused me to wander from my father 's house , that I said unto her , This is THY kindness which thou shalt shew unto me ; at every place whither we shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
and God said unto Abraham , Let it not be grievous in THY sight because of the lad , and because of THY bondwoman ; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee , hearken unto her voice ; for in Isaac shall THY seed be called .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bowshot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and wept .
thus they made a Covenant at Beer @-@ sheba : then Abimelech rose up , and Phichol the chief captain of his host , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and clave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
and Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
that in blessing I will bless thee , and in multiplying I will multiply THY seed as the stars of the heaven , and as the sand which is upon the sea shore ; and THY seed shall possess the gate of his enemies ;
and he communed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which he hath , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you .
and Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth : and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
and Abraham hearkened unto Ephron ; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant .
and after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre : the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan .
and I will make thee swear by the Lord , the God of heaven , and the God of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I dwell :
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor .
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel , son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother , with her pitcher upon her shoulder .
and the damsel was very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pitcher , and came up .
and it came to pass , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ;
and he said , blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham , who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth : I being in the way , the Lord led me to the house of my master 's brethren .
and he said unto me , The Lord , before whom I walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper THY way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father 's house :
behold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water , and I say to her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water of THY pitcher to drink ;
and I bowed down my head , and worshipped the Lord , and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham , which had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter unto his son .
and it came to pass , that , when Abraham 's servant heard their words , he worshipped the Lord , bowing himself to the earth .
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels were coming .
but unto the sons of the concubines , which Abraham had , Abraham gave gifts , and sent them away from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , eastward , unto the east country .
and his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ;
now these are the generations of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's handmaid , bare unto Abraham :
and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
and these are the years of the life of Ishmael , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the ghost and died ; and was gathered unto his people .
Sojourn in this land , and I will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto THY seed , I will give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham THY father ;
and I will make THY seed to multiply as the stars of heaven , and will give unto THY seed all these countries ; and in THY seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife .
for all the wells which his father 's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped them , and filled them with earth .
and Isaac digged again the wells of water , which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father ; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham : and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
and it came to pass , that when Isaac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called Esau his eldest son , and said unto him , My son : and he said unto him , behold , here am I.
go now to the flock , and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats ; and I will make them savoury meat for THY father , such as he loveth :
and he said , Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's venison , that my soul may bless thee . and he brought it near to him , and he did eat : and he brought him wine , and he drank .
and he came near , and kissed him : and he smelled the smell of his raiment , and blessed him , and said , See , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed :
and it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
and by THY sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve THY brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off THY neck .
and these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah : and she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said unto him , behold , THY brother Esau , as touching thee , doth comfort himself , purposing to kill thee .
and he lighted upon a certain place , and tarried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pillows , and lay down in that place to sleep .
and he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven : and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
and THY seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in thee and in THY seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
and , behold , I am with thee , and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for I will not leave thee , until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of .
and Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pillows , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it .
and Jacob vowed a vow , saying , If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and raiment to put on ,
and he looked , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three flocks of sheep lying by it ; for out of that well they watered the flocks : and a great stone was upon the well 's mouth .
and thither were all the flocks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in his place .
and it came to pass , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Laban his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the flock of Laban his mother 's brother .
and it came to pass , when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister 's son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . and he told Laban all these things .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in unto her .
and it came to pass , when Rachel had born Joseph , that Jacob said unto Laban , Send me away , that I may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
I will pass through all THY flock to day , removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle , and all the brown cattle among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goats : and of such shall be my hire .
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink .
and Jacob did separate the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked , and all the brown in the flock of Laban ; and he put his own flocks by themselves , and put them not unto Laban 's cattle .
and it came to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods .
and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived , that I lifted up mine eyes , and saw in a dream , and , behold , the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked , speckled , and grisled .
and he carried away all his cattle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the cattle of his getting , which he had gotten in Padan @-@ aram , for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan .
and Laban went into Jacob 's tent , and into Leah 's tent , and into the two maidservants ' tents ; but he found them not . then went he out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
that which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
and early in the morning Laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them : and Laban departed , and returned unto his place .
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto THY servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank , which is upon the hollow of the thigh , unto this day : because he touched the hollow of Jacob 's thigh in the sinew that shrank .
and Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Esau came , and with him four hundred men . and he divided the children unto Leah , and unto Rachel , and unto the two handmaids .
let my lord , I pray thee , pass over before his servant : and I will lead on softly , according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure , until I come unto my lord unto Seir .
and Jacob came to Shalem , a city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Padan @-@ aram ; and pitched his tent before the city .
and he bought a parcel of a field , where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem 's father , for an hundred pieces of money .
and when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , prince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and defiled her .
then will we give our daughters unto you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
and the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter : and he was more honourable than all the house of his father .
and unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circumcised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
and they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went out .
they took their sheep , and their oxen , and their asses , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ,
and let us arise , and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand , and all their earrings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem .
so Jacob came to Luz , which is in the land of Canaan , that is , Bethel , he and all the people that were with him .
and he built there an altar , and called the place El @-@ Beth @-@ el : because there God appeared unto him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him , even a pillar of stone : and he poured a drink offering thereon , and he poured oil thereon .
and Esau took his wives , and his sons , and his daughters , and all the persons of his house , and his cattle , and all his beasts , and all his substance , which he had got in the land of Canaan ; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob .
and these are the sons of Reuel Esau 's son ; Duke Nahath , Duke Zerah , Duke Shammah , Duke Mizzah : these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau 's wife .
and Husham died , and Hadad the son of Bedad , who smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
and Baal @-@ hanan the son of Achbor died , and Hadar reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pau ; and his wife 's name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
and these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; Duke Timnah , Duke Alvah , Duke Jetheth ,
for , behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arose , and also stood upright ; and , behold , your sheaves stood round about , and made obeisance to my sheaf .
come now therefore , and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some evil beast hath devoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
and Reuben said unto them , shed no blood , but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness , and lay no hand upon him ; that he might rid him out of their hands , to deliver him to his father again .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
and they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , behold , a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt .
then there passed by Midianites merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and it came to pass at that time , that Judah went down from his brethren , and turned in to a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
and Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
and she arose , and went away , and laid by her vail from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
and Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites , which had brought him down thither .
and he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand ; and he knew not ought he had , save the bread which he did eat . and Joseph was a goodly person , and well favoured .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spake unto him , saying , After this manner did THY servant to me ; that his wrath was kindled .
and Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king 's prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
and the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the doer of it .
and it came to pass after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt .
and they dreamed a dream both of them , each man his dream in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the Butler and the Baker of the king of Egypt , which were bound in the prison .
and in the vine were three branches : and it was as though it budded , and her blossoms shot forth ; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes :
and Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand .
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head , and restore thee unto THY place : and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh 's cup into his hand , after the former manner when thou wast his Butler .
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up THY head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat THY flesh from off thee .
and it came to pass the third day , which was Pharaoh 's birthday , that he made a feast unto all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief Butler and of the chief Baker among his servants .
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and leanfleshed ; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Pharaoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh .
and there was there with us a young man , an Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams ; to each man according to his dream he did interpret .
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them , poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness :
and when they had eaten them up , it could not be known that they had eaten them ; but they were still ill favoured , as at the beginning . so I awoke .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
and Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years , which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was round about every city , laid he up in the same .
and the famine was over all the face of the earth : and Joseph opened all the storehouses , and sold unto the Egyptians ; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt .
and he said , behold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt : get you down thither , and buy for us from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
and Joseph was the governor over the land , and he it was that sold to all the people of the land : and Joseph 's brethren came , and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth .
and he turned himself about from them , and wept ; and returned to them again , and communed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn , and to restore every man 's money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he unto them .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the Inn , he espied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack 's mouth .
and the man , the lord of the country , said unto us , Hereby shall I know that ye are true men ; leave one of your brethren here with me , and take food for the famine of your households , and be gone :
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
but if thou wilt not send him , we will not go down : for the man said unto us , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks , carry it again in your hand ; peradventure it was an oversight :
and it came to pass , when we came to the Inn , that we opened our sacks , and , behold , every man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyptians , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews ; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan : how then should we steal out of THY lord 's house silver or gold ?
then Judah came near unto him , and said , Oh my lord , let THY servant , I pray thee , speak a word in my lord 's ears , and let not thine anger burn against THY servant : for thou art even as Pharaoh .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
so now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen , and thou shalt be near unto me , thou , and THY children , and THY children 's children , and THY flocks , and THY herds , and all that thou hast :
and the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , Joseph 's brethren are come : and it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
and take your father and your households , and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
now thou art commanded , this do ye ; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
and they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said unto them : and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob their father revived :
and Jacob rose up from Beer @-@ sheba : and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father , and their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two souls : all the souls of the house of Jacob , which came into Egypt , were threescore and ten .
and Joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Goshen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father 's house , I will go up , and shew Pharaoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Canaan , are come unto me ;
that ye shall say , Thy servants ' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fathers : that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
then Joseph came and told Pharaoh , and said , My father and my brethren , and their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Canaan ; and , behold , they are in the land of Goshen .
they said moreover unto Pharaoh , For to sojourn in the land are we come ; for THY servants have no pasture for their flocks ; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let THY servants dwell in the land of Goshen .
and Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
and they brought their cattle unto Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses , and for the flocks , and for the cattle of the herds , and for the asses : and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year .
and it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh , and four parts shall be your own , for seed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your little ones .
and now THY two sons , Ephraim and Manasseh , which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt , are mine ; as Reuben and Simeon , they shall be mine .
and as for me , when I came from Padan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath : and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath ; the same is Bethlehem .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he could not see . and he brought them near unto him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
and Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near unto him .
and Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it upon Ephraim 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Manasseh 's head , guiding his hands wittingly ; for Manasseh was the firstborn .
and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim , it displeased him : and he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from Ephraim 's head unto Manasseh 's head .
O my soul , come not thou into their secret ; unto their assembly , mine honour , be not thou united : for in their anger they slew a man , and in their selfwill they digged down a wall .
but his bow abode in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob ; ( from thence is the shepherd , the stone of Israel : )
even by the God of THY father , who shall help thee ; and by the Almighty , who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lieth under , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb :
the blessings of THY father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills : they shall be on the head of Joseph , and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren .
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel : and this is it that their father spake unto them , and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh , saying , If now I have found grace in your eyes , speak , I pray you , in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
and all the house of Joseph , and his brethren , and his father 's house : only their little ones , and their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , wherein they made them serve , was with rigour .
and the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew Midwives , of which the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah :
and he said , When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women , and see them upon the stools ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an Ark of bulrushes , and daubed it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she laid it in the flags by the river 's brink .
and the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river ; and her maidens walked along by the river 's side ; and when she saw the Ark among the flags , she sent her maid to fetch it .
and when she had opened it , she saw the child : and , behold , the babe wept . and she had compassion on him , and said , This is one of the Hebrews ' children .
and it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren , and looked on their burdens : and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew , one of his brethren .
and he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he slew the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian : and he sat down by a well .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the king of Egypt died : and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage , and they cried , and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage .
now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law , the priest of Midian : and he led the flock to the backside of the desert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Horeb .
and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he looked , and , behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
moreover he said , I am the God of THY father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large , unto a land flowing with milk and honey ; unto the place of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them .
and Moses said unto God , behold , when I come unto the children of Israel , and shall say unto them , The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you ; and they shall say to me , What is his name ? what shall I say unto them ?
and God said moreover unto Moses , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath sent me unto you : this is my name for ever , and this is my memorial unto all generations .
go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , appeared unto me , saying , I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , unto a land flowing with milk and honey .
and I will stretch out my hand , and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof : and after that he will let you go .
and I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that sojourneth in her house , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians .
and he said , Put thine hand into THY bosom again . and he put his hand into his bosom again ; and plucked it out of his bosom , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither hearken unto THY voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .
and thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth : and I will be with THY mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be THY spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him instead of God .
and Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
and the Lord said unto Moses , When thou goest to return into Egypt , see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh , which I have put in thine hand : but I will harden his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
and the people believed : and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshipped .
and the officers of the children of Israel , which Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ?
and I have also established my Covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage ; and I have remembered my Covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and I will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the Lord .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations ; Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari : and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years .
and the sons of Kohath ; Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel : and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years .
and Amram took him Jochebed his father 's sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Eleazar Aaron 's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife ; and she bare him Phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
but Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that I may lay my hand upon Egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
and Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh , and they did so as the Lord had commanded : and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh , and before his servants , and it became a serpent .
get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning ; lo , he goeth out unto the water ; and thou shalt stand by the river 's brink against he come ; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand .
thus saith the Lord , In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord : behold , I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
and Moses and Aaron did so , as the Lord commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and smote the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Pharaoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
and the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stank , and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly , which shall go up and come into thine house , and into THY bedchamber , and upon THY bed , and into the house of THY servants , and upon THY people , and into thine ovens , and into THY kneadingtroughs :
and the Lord spake unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch forth thine hand with THY rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
and they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smote the dust of the earth , and it became lice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh ; lo , he cometh forth to the water ; and say unto him , Thus saith the Lord , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if thou wilt not let my people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies upon thee , and upon THY servants , and upon THY people , and into THY houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
and I will sever in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth .
and the Lord did so ; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ' houses , and into all the land of Egypt : the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies .
and the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
behold , the hand of the Lord is upon THY cattle which is in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the camels , upon the oxen , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
and the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children 's of Israel .
and Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
for I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart , and upon THY servants , and upon THY people ; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
behold , to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the Lord sent Thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
so there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
and Moses said unto him , As soon as I am gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord ; and the Thunder shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the Lord 's .
and Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
and that thou mayest tell in the ears of THY son , and of THY son 's son , what things I have wrought in Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that ye may know how that I am the Lord .
and they shall cover the face of the earth , that one cannot be able to see the earth : and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped , which remaineth unto you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field :
and they shall fill THY houses , and the houses of all THY servants , and the houses of all the Egyptians ; which neither THY fathers , nor THY fathers ' fathers have seen , since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day . and he turned himself , and went out from Pharaoh .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail hath left .
and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
and the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the coasts of Egypt : very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
and the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind , which took away the locusts , and cast them into the Red sea ; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt .
speak now in the ears of the people , and let every man borrow of his neighbour , and every woman of her neighbour , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold .
and the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians . moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharaoh 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beasts .
but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel .
and all these THY servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that I will go out . and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger .
speak ye unto all the Congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house :
and if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls ; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the Lord .
seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses : for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever .
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses : for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the Congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
for the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side posts , the Lord will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keep this service .
that ye shall say , It is the sacrifice of the Lord 's passover , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he smote the Egyptians , and delivered our houses . and the people bowed the head and worshipped .
and it came to pass , that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharoah that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
and Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment :
and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not leavened ; because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselves any victual .
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the selfsame day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
in one house shall it be eaten ; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
and Moses said unto the people , Remember this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place : there shall no leavened bread be eaten .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which he sware unto THY fathers to give thee , a land flowing with milk and honey , that thou shalt keep this service in this month .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eyes , that the Lord 's law may be in THY mouth : for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt .
that thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix , and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the Lord 's .
and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; and if thou wilt not redeem it , then thou shalt break his neck : and all the firstborn of man among THY children shalt thou redeem .
but God led the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt .
and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
and when Pharaoh drew nigh , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and , behold , the Egyptians marched after them ; and they were sore afraid : and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord .
is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt , saying , Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and Moses said unto the people , Fear ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the Lord , which he will shew to you to day : for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
but lift thou up THY rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and troubled the host of the Egyptians ,
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
but the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord , and spake , saying , I will sing unto the Lord , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his Rider hath he thrown into the sea .
fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till THY people pass over , O Lord , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
Thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , O Lord , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the sanctuary , O Lord , which THY hands have established .
for the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea .
and they took their journey from Elim , and all the Congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and it came to pass , as Aaron spake unto the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and , behold , the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud .
and it came to pass , that at even the quails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when the dew that lay was gone up , behold , upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing , as small as the hoar Frost on the ground .
this is the thing which the Lord hath commanded , Gather of it every man according to his eating , an Omer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his tents .
and when they did Mete it with an Omer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his eating .
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and stank : and Moses was wroth with them .
and it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for one man : and all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses .
see , for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and the children of Israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
and all the Congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin , after their journeys , according to the commandment of the Lord , and pitched in Rephidim : and there was no water for the people to drink .
behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . and Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
and it came to pass , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed : and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
when Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
and Moses went out to meet his father in law , and did obeisance , and kissed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
and Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
and Jethro said , blessed be the Lord , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
and Jethro , Moses ' father in law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God : and Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father in law before God .
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , hating covetousness ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens :
and let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
if thou shalt do this thing , and God command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai .
for they were departed from Rephidim , and were come to the desert of Sinai , and had pitched in the wilderness ; and there Israel camped before the mount .
and Moses went up unto God , and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ;
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my Covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , Take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death :
and the Lord came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
and the Lord said unto him , away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and Aaron with thee : but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord , lest he break forth upon them .
Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord THY God : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor THY son , nor THY daughter , THY manservant , nor THY maidservant , nor THY cattle , nor THY stranger that is within THY gates :
Thou shalt not covet THY neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet THY neighbour 's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is THY neighbour 's .
and all the people saw the thunderings , and the lightnings , and the noise of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking : and when the people saw it , they removed , and stood afar off .
an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me , and shalt sacrifice thereon THY burnt offerings , and THY peace offerings , THY sheep , and thine oxen : in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee , and I will bless thee .
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hewn stone : for if thou lift up THY tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
if his master have given him a wife , and she have born him sons or daughters ; the wife and her children shall be her master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
if she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smote him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past , and his owner hath not kept him in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be his own .
if fire break out , and catch in thorns , so that the stacks of corn , or the standing corn , or the field , be consumed therewith ; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution .
if the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods .
then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both , that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
for that is his covering only , it is his raiment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ? and it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gracious .
and in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect : and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of THY mouth .
Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread : ( thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days , as I commanded thee , in the time appointed of the month Abib ; for in it thou camest out from Egypt : and none shall appear before me empty : )
for mine Angel shall go before thee , and bring thee in unto the Amorites , and the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites : and I will cut them off .
and ye shall serve the Lord your God , and he shall bless THY bread , and THY water ; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee .
I will send my fear before thee , and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee .
and I will set THY bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines , and from the desert unto the river : for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand ; and thou shalt drive them out before thee .
and Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord , and all the judgments : and all the people answered with one voice , and said , All the words which the Lord hath said will we do .
and they saw the God of Israel : and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone , and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness .
and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel .
and Moses went into the midst of the cloud , and gat him up into the mount : and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights .
according to all that I shew thee , after the pattern of the tabernacle , and the pattern of all the instruments thereof , even so shall ye make it .
and they shall make an Ark of shittim wood : two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , within and without shalt thou overlay it , and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in the four corners thereof ; and two rings shall be in the one side of it , and two rings in the other side of it .
and thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the Ark , that the Ark may be borne with them .
and make one cherub on the one end , and the other cherub on the other end : even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high , covering the mercy seat with their wings , and their faces shall look one to another ; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be .
and thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about , and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about .
and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work shall the candlestick be made : his Shaft , and his branches , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , shall be of the same .
three bowls made like unto almonds , with a Knop and a flower in one branch ; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch , with a Knop and a flower : so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick .
and there shall be a Knop under two branches of the same , and a Knop under two branches of the same , and a Knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick .
and thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling ; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain , and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second ; that the loops may take hold one of another .
and thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling , and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
and the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent , the half curtain that remaineth , shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle .
and a cubit on the one side , and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent , it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side , to cover it .
and thou shalt overlay the boards with gold , and make their rings of gold for places for the bars : and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold .
and thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches , that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the Ark of the testimony : and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy .
and thou shalt set the table without the vail , and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south : and thou shalt put the table on the north side .
and thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof : his horns shall be of the same : and thou shalt overlay it with brass .
and the staves shall be put into the rings , and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar , to bear it .
and likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long , and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
and take thou unto thee Aaron THY brother , and his sons with him , from among the children of Israel , that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office , even Aaron , Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar , Aaron 's sons .
and thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted , whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom , that they may make Aaron 's garments to consecrate him , that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and these are the garments which they shall make ; a breastplate , and an ephod , and a robe , and a broidered coat , a Mitre , and a girdle : and they shall make holy garments for Aaron THY brother , and his sons , that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work ; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it ; of gold , of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine twined linen , shalt thou make it .
and thou shalt set in it settings of stones , even four rows of stones : the first row shall be a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this shall be the first row .
and the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names , like the engravings of a signet ; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes .
and thou shalt make two rings of gold , and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof , which is in the side of the ephod inward .
and two other rings of gold thou shalt make , and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart thereof , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
and they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod .
and there shall be an hole in the top of it , in the midst thereof : it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it , as it were the hole of an habergeon , that it be not rent .
and beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , round about the hem thereof ; and bells of gold between them round about :
and it shall be upon Aaron to minister : and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the Lord , and when he cometh out , that he die not .
and thou shalt put it on a blue lace , that it may be upon the Mitre ; upon the forefront of the Mitre it shall be .
and for Aaron 's sons thou shalt make coats , and thou shalt make for them girdles , and bonnets shalt thou make for them , for glory and for beauty .
and thou shalt put them upon Aaron THY brother , and his sons with him ; and shalt anoint them , and consecrate them , and sanctify them , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and shalt wash them with water .
and thou shalt take the garments , and put upon Aaron the coat , and the robe of the ephod , and the ephod , and the breastplate , and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod :
and thou shalt gird them with girdles , Aaron and his sons , and put the bonnets on them : and the priest 's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute : and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons .
and thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock .
and thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock , and put it upon the horns of the altar with THY finger , and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar .
and thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul that is above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and burn them upon the altar .
and thou shalt cut the ram in pieces , and wash the inwards of him , and his legs , and put them unto his pieces , and unto his head .
then shalt thou kill the ram , and take of his blood , and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron , and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons , and upon the thumb of their right hand , and upon the great toe of their right foot , and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
and thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar , and of the anointing oil , and sprinkle it upon Aaron , and upon his garments , and upon his sons , and upon the garments of his sons with him : and he shall be hallowed , and his garments , and his sons , and his sons ' garments with him .
also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump , and the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and the right shoulder ; for it is a ram of consecration :
and one loaf of bread , and one cake of oiled bread , and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the Lord :
and thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron , and in the hands of his sons ; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord .
and thou shalt receive them of their hands , and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour before the Lord : it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering , and the shoulder of the heave offering , which is waved , and which is heaved up , of the ram of the consecration , even of that which is for Aaron , and of that which is for his sons :
and it shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel : for it is an heave offering : and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings , even their heave offering unto the Lord .
and if ought of the flesh of the consecrations , or of the bread , remain unto the morning , then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire : it shall not be eaten , because it is holy .
and thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for Atonement : and thou shalt cleanse the altar , when thou hast made an Atonement for it , and thou shalt anoint it , to sanctify it .
and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even , and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning , and according to the drink offering thereof , for a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and I will sanctify the tabernacle of the Congregation , and the altar : I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons , to minister to me in the priest 's office .
and they shall know that I am the Lord their God , that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I may dwell among them : I am the Lord their God .
a cubit shall be the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof ; foursquare shall it be : and two cubits shall be the height thereof : the horns thereof shall be of the same .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , the top thereof , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns thereof ; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about .
and two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it , by the two corners thereof , upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it ; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal .
and thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the Ark of the testimony , before the mercy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with thee .
and Aaron shall make an Atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements : once in the year shall he make Atonement upon it throughout your generations : it is most holy unto the Lord .
when thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number , then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord , when thou numberest them ; that there be no plague among them , when thou numberest them .
this they shall give , every one that passeth among them that are numbered , half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary : ( a shekel is twenty gerahs : ) an half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord .
the rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel , when they give an offering unto the Lord , to make an Atonement for your souls .
Thou shalt also make a laver of brass , and his foot also of brass , to wash withal : and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the Congregation and the altar , and thou shalt put water therein .
take thou also unto thee principal spices , of pure myrrh five hundred shekels , and of sweet Cinnamon half so much , even two hundred and fifty shekels , and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels ,
upon man 's flesh shall it not be poured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is holy , and it shall be holy unto you .
and thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the Congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
and as for the perfume which thou shalt make , ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof : it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord .
and I , behold , I have given with him Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee ;
and the cloths of service , and the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office ,
Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it is holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
six days may work be done ; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest , holy to the Lord : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
and Aaron said unto them , Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
and he received them at their hand , and fashioned it with a graving tool , after he had made it a molten calf : and they said , These be THY gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them : they have made them a molten calf , and have worshipped it , and have sacrificed thereunto , and said , These be THY gods , O Israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and Moses besought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why doth THY wrath wax hot against THY people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
Wherefore should the Egyptians speak , and say , For mischief did he bring them out , to slay them in the mountains , and to consume them from the face of the earth ? turn from THY fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against THY people .
and Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and he said , It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the noise of them that sing do I hear .
and it came to pass , as soon as he came nigh unto the camp , that he saw the calf , and the dancing : and Moses ' anger waxed hot , and he cast the tables out of his hands , and brake them beneath the mount .
and he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Who is on the Lord 's side ? let him come unto me . and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him .
and he said unto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbour .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Lord ; peradventure I shall make an Atonement for your sin .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin-- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of THY book which thou hast written .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and the Lord said unto Moses , depart , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt , unto the land which I sware unto Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , unto THY seed will I give it :
and it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tabernacle .
and it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the Lord talked with Moses .
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rose up and worshipped , every man in his tent door .
and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face , as a man speaketh unto his friend . and he turned again into the camp : but his servant Joshua , the son of nun , a young man , departed not out of the tabernacle .
now therefore , I pray thee , if I have found grace in THY sight , shew me now THY way , that I may know thee , that I may find grace in THY sight : and consider that this nation is THY people .
and he said , I will make all my Goodness pass before thee , and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee ; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious , and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy .
and it shall come to pass , while my glory passeth by , that I will put thee in a clift of the rock , and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by :
and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount Sinai , as the Lord had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
and thou take of their daughters unto THY sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make THY sons go a whoring after their gods .
for I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge THY borders : neither shall any man desire THY land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord THY God thrice in the year .
and it came to pass , when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses ' hand , when he came down from the mount , that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
but when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him , he took the vail off , until he came out . and he came out , and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the vail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
and Moses gathered all the Congregation of the children of Israel together , and said unto them , These are the words which the Lord hath commanded , that ye should do them .
and the incense altar , and his staves , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle ,
the cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office .
and they came , every one whose heart stirred him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the Lord 's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and for all his service , and for the holy garments .
every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the Lord 's offering : and every man , with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service , brought it .
and all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands , and brought that which they had spun , both of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine linen .
the children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses .
and he hath put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan .
and Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom , even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it :
and he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling : likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
fifty loops made he in one curtain , and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second : the loops held one curtain to another .
and he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling , and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
and Bezaleel made the Ark of shittim wood : two cubits and a half was the length of it , and a cubit and a half the breadth of it , and a cubit and a half the height of it :
and he made two cherubims of gold , beaten out of one piece made he them , on the two ends of the mercy seat ;
one cherub on the end on this side , and another cherub on the other end on that side : out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spoons , and his bowls , and his covers to cover withal , of pure gold .
and he made the candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work made he the candlestick ; his Shaft , and his branch , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , were of the same :
and six branches going out of the sides thereof ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof :
three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch , a Knop and a flower ; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch , a Knop and a flower : so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick .
and a Knop under two branches of the same , and a Knop under two branches of the same , and a Knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches going out of it .
and he made the incense altar of shittim wood : the length of it was a cubit , and the breadth of it a cubit ; it was foursquare ; and two cubits was the height of it ; the horns thereof were of the same .
and he overlaid it with pure gold , both the top of it , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns of it : also he made unto it a crown of gold round about .
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the staves to bear it withal .
and he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood : five cubits was the length thereof , and five cubits the breadth thereof ; it was foursquare ; and three cubits the height thereof .
and he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it ; the horns thereof were of the same : and he overlaid it with brass .
and he made all the vessels of the altar , the pots , and the shovels , and the basons , and the fleshhooks , and the firepans : all the vessels thereof made he of brass .
and he made the laver of brass , and the foot of it of brass , of the lookingglasses of the women assembling , which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and for the other side of the court gate , on this hand and that hand , were hangings of fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
and the sockets for the pillars were of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver ; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver .
and the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : and twenty cubits was the length , and the height in the breadth was five cubits , answerable to the hangings of the court .
this is the sum of the tabernacle , even of the tabernacle of testimony , as it was counted , according to the commandment of Moses , for the service of the Levites , by the hand of Ithamar , son to Aaron the priest .
and with him was Aholiab , son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan , an engraver , and a cunning workman , and an embroiderer in blue , and in purple , and in scarlet , and fine linen .
all the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place , even the gold of the offering , was twenty and nine talents , and seven hundred and thirty shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
and the silver of them that were numbered of the Congregation was an hundred talents , and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
and they did beat the gold into thin plates , and cut it into wires , to work it in the blue , and in the purple , and in the scarlet , and in the fine linen , with cunning work .
and the curious girdle of his ephod , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work thereof ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he put them on the shoulders of the ephod , that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names , like the engravings of a signet , every one with his name , according to the twelve tribes .
and they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the breastplate , upon the border of it , which was on the side of the ephod inward .
and they made two other golden rings , and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart of it , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
and they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and there was an hole in the midst of the robe , as the hole of an habergeon , with a band round about the hole , that it should not rend .
and they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the engravings of a signet , HOLINESS TO the Lord .
and Moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they have done it as the Lord had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
and thou shalt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick , and light the lamps thereof .
and thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy .
and thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
and Moses reared up the tabernacle , and fastened his sockets , and set up the boards thereof , and put in the bars thereof , and reared up his pillars .
and he brought the Ark into the tabernacle , and set up the vail of the covering , and covered the Ark of the testimony ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the Congregation , and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
for the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day , and fire was on it by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their journeys .
if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd , let him offer a male without blemish : he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord .
and he shall kill the bullock before the Lord : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall bring the blood , and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall lay the parts , the head , and the fat , in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar :
and he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar .
and he shall cut it into his pieces , with his head and his fat : and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar :
but he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water : and the priest shall bring it all , and burn it upon the altar : it is a burnt sacrifice , an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and the priest shall bring it unto the altar , and wring off his head , and burn it on the altar ; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar :
and he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers , and cast it beside the altar on the east part , by the place of the ashes :
and he shall bring it to Aaron 's sons the priests : and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof , and of the oil thereof , with all the frankincense thereof ; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar , to be an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord :
and the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire .
and thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the Lord : and when it is presented unto the priest , he shall bring it unto the altar .
and the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof , and shall burn it upon the altar : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire .
and every oblation of THY meat offering shalt thou season with salt ; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the Covenant of THY God to be lacking from THY meat offering : with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt .
and if thou offer a meat offering of THY firstfruits unto the Lord , thou shalt offer for the meat offering of THY firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire , even corn beaten out of full ears .
and the priest shall burn the memorial of it , part of the beaten corn thereof , and part of the oil thereof , with all the frankincense thereof : it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation : and Aaron 's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and Aaron 's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice , which is upon the wood that is on the fire : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and Aaron 's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord ; the fat thereof , and the whole rump , it shall he take off hard by the backbone ; and the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them :
if the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sinned , a young bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering .
and he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord ; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock 's head , and kill the bullock before the Lord .
and the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord , which is in the tabernacle of the Congregation : and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering , which is at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away ,
and if the whole Congregation of Israel sin through ignorance , and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly , and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which should not be done , and are guilty ;
when the sin , which they have sinned against it , is known , then the Congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin , and bring him before the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the Lord , that is in the tabernacle of the Congregation , and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering , which is at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the priest shall make an Atonement for them , and it shall be forgiven them .
or if his sin , wherein he hath sinned , come to his knowledge ; he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a male without blemish :
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord : it is a sin offering .
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering .
and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar , as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if any one of the common people sin through ignorance , while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ;
or if his sin , which he hath sinned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without blemish , for his sin which he hath sinned .
and the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar .
and he shall take away all the fat thereof , as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings ; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the Lord ; and the priest shall make an Atonement for him , and it shall be forgiven him .
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar :
and he shall take away all the fat thereof , as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings ; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar , according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord : and the priest shall make an Atonement for his sin that he hath committed , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of swearing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his iniquity .
or if a soul touch any unclean thing , whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast , or a carcase of unclean cattle , or the carcase of unclean creeping things , and if it be hidden from him ; he also shall be unclean , and guilty .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord for his sin which he hath sinned , a female from the flock , a lamb or a kid of the goats , for a sin offering ; and the priest shall make an Atonement for him concerning his sin .
and if he be not able to bring a lamb , then he shall bring for his trespass , which he hath committed , two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , unto the Lord ; one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering .
and he shall bring them unto the priest , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wring off his head from his neck , but shall not divide it asunder :
and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar ; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar : it is a sin offering .
and he shall offer the second for a burnt offering , according to the manner : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned , and it shall be forgiven him .
then shall he bring it to the priest , and the priest shall take his handful of it , even a memorial thereof , and burn it on the altar , according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord : it is a sin offering .
and the priest shall make an Atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these , and it shall be forgiven him : and the remnant shall be the priest 's , as a meat offering .
and he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing , and shall add the fifth part thereto , and give it unto the priest : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
and he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock , with THY estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not , and it shall be forgiven him .
then it shall be , because he hath sinned , and is guilty , that he shall restore that which he took violently away , or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten , or that which was delivered him to keep , or the lost thing which he found ,
or all that about which he hath sworn falsely ; he shall even restore it in the principal , and shall add the fifth part more thereto , and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth , in the day of his trespass offering .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord , a ram without blemish out of the flock , with THY estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest :
command Aaron and his sons , saying , This is the law of the burnt offering : it is the burnt offering , because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning , and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it .
and the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
and he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it ; it shall not be put out : and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning , and lay the burnt offering in order upon it ; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings .
and he shall take of it his handful , of the flour of the meat offering , and of the oil thereof , and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering , and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour , even the memorial of it , unto the Lord .
and the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat : with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tabernacle of the Congregation they shall eat it .
it shall not be baken with leaven . I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire ; it is most holy , as is the sin offering , and as the trespass offering .
in a pan it shall be made with oil ; and when it is baken , thou shalt bring it in : and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the Lord .
whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy : and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment , thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place .
and no sin offering , whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the Congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place , shall be eaten : it shall be burnt in the fire .
and the priest that offereth any man 's burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
and all the meat offering that is baken in the oven , and all that is dressed in the fryingpan , and in the pan , shall be the priest 's that offereth it .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the Lord , and it shall be the priest 's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings .
and the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for Thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered ; he shall not leave any of it until the morning .
and if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day , it shall not be accepted , neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it : it shall be an abomination , and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity .
but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings , that pertain unto the Lord , having his uncleanness upon him , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
and the fat of the beast that dieth of itself , and the fat of that which is torn with beasts , may be used in any other use : but ye shall in no wise eat of it .
for whosoever eateth the fat of the beast , of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord , even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people .
his own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire , the fat with the breast , it shall he bring , that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord .
for the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings , and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel .
this is the portion of the anointing of Aaron , and of the anointing of his sons , out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest 's office ;
this is the law of the burnt offering , of the meat offering , and of the sin offering , and of the trespass offering , and of the consecrations , and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings ;
and he put upon him the coat , and girded him with the girdle , and clothed him with the robe , and put the ephod upon him , and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod , and bound it unto him therewith .
and he slew it ; and Moses took the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger , and purified the altar , and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar , and sanctified it , to make reconciliation upon it .
and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards , and caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and Moses burned it upon the altar .
and he slew it ; and Moses took of the blood of it , and put it upon the tip of Aaron 's right ear , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot .
and he brought Aaron 's sons , and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear , and upon the thumbs of their right hands , and upon the great toes of their right feet : and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
and he took the fat , and the rump , and all the fat that was upon the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and the right shoulder :
and out of the basket of unleavened bread , that was before the Lord , he took one unleavened cake , and a cake of oiled bread , and one wafer , and put them on the fat , and upon the right shoulder :
and Moses took them from off their hands , and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering : they were consecrations for a sweet savour : it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and Moses took of the anointing oil , and of the blood which was upon the altar , and sprinkled it upon Aaron , and upon his garments , and upon his sons , and upon his sons ' garments with him ; and sanctified Aaron , and his garments , and his sons , and his sons ' garments with him .
and ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation in seven days , until the days of your consecration be at an end : for seven days shall he consecrate you .
and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak , saying , Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering ; and a calf and a lamb , both of the first year , without blemish , for a burnt offering ;
and the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him : and he dipped his finger in the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar , and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar :
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram , the rump , and that which covereth the inwards , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver :
and Nadab and Abihu , the sons of Aaron , took either of them his censer , and put fire therein , and put incense thereon , and offered strange fire before the Lord , which he commanded them not .
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , lest ye die : for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you . and they did according to the word of Moses .
and Moses spake unto Aaron , and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons that were left , Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made by fire , and eat it without leaven beside the altar : for it is most holy :
and ye shall eat it in the holy place , because it is THY due , and THY sons ' due , of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire : for so I am commanded .
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the hoof : as the Camel , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
and all that have not fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you :
and these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls ; they shall not be eaten , they are an abomination : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray ,
yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four , which have legs above their feet , to leap withal upon the earth ;
even these of them ye may eat ; the locust after his kind , and the bald locust after his kind , and the beetle after his kind , and the grasshopper after his kind .
and whatsoever goeth upon his paws , among all manner of beasts that go on all four , those are unclean unto you : whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even .
of all meat which may be eaten , that on which such water cometh shall be unclean : and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean .
and he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
whatsoever goeth upon the belly , and whatsoever goeth upon all four , or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an abomination .
Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
for I am the Lord your God : ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
for I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a woman have conceived seed , and born a man child : then she shall be unclean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean .
who shall offer it before the Lord , and make an Atonement for her ; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hath born a male or a female .
when a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising , a scab , or a bright spot , and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy ; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest , or unto one of his sons the priests :
and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh : and when the hair in the plague is turned white , and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh , it is a plague of leprosy : and the priest shall look on him , and pronounce him unclean .
if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turned white ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days :
and the priest shall look on him the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague in his sight be at a stay , and the plague spread not in the skin ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more :
and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce him clean : it is but a scab : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
but if the scab spread much abroad in the skin , after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the priest again :
and the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the rising be white in the skin , and it have turned the hair white , and there be quick raw flesh in the rising ;
and if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin , and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot , wheresoever the priest looketh ;
then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the leprosy have covered all his flesh , he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague : it is all turned white : he is clean .
and the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the plague be turned into white ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague : he is clean .
and if , when the priest seeth it , behold , it be in sight lower than the skin , and the hair thereof be turned white ; the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil .
but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white hairs therein , and if it be not lower than the skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white hair in the bright spot , and it be no lower than the other skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
and if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not in the skin , but it be somewhat dark ; it is a rising of the burning , and the priest shall pronounce him clean : for it is an inflammation of the burning .
and if the priest look on the plague of the scall , and , behold , it be not in sight deeper than the skin , and that there is no black hair in it ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days :
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague : and , behold , if the scall spread not , and there be in it no yellow hair , and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin ;
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall : and , behold , if the scall be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper than the skin ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
then the priest shall look on him : and , behold , if the scall be spread in the skin , the priest shall not seek for yellow hair ; he is unclean .
then the priest shall look : and , behold , if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white ; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin ; he is clean .
and he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , he is forehead bald : yet is he clean .
then the priest shall look upon it : and , behold , if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head , or in his bald forehead , as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh ;
and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment , or in the skin , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a plague of leprosy , and shall be shewed unto the priest :
and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day : if the plague be spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in a skin , or in any work that is made of skin ; the plague is a fretting leprosy ; it is unclean .
he shall therefore burn that garment , whether warp or woof , in woollen or in linen , or any thing of skin , wherein the plague is : for it is a fretting leprosy ; it shall be burnt in the fire .
and if the priest shall look , and , behold , the plague be not spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ;
and if the priest look , and , behold , the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it ; then he shall rend it out of the garment , or out of the skin , or out of the warp , or out of the woof :
and if it appear still in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a spreading plague : thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire .
and the garment , either warp , or woof , or whatsoever thing of skin it be , which thou shalt wash , if the plague be departed from them , then it shall be washed the second time , and shall be clean .
this is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen , either in the warp , or woof , or any thing of skins , to pronounce it clean , or to pronounce it unclean .
and the priest shall go forth out of the camp ; and the priest shall look , and , behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ;
as for the living bird , he shall take it , and the cedar wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water :
and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
and he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes , and shave off all his hair , and wash himself in water , that he may be clean : and after that he shall come into the camp , and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days .
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall shave off : and he shall wash his clothes , also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
and the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean , and those things , before the Lord , at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering , in the holy place : for as the sin offering is the priest 's , so is the trespass offering : it is most holy :
and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering , and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot :

then the priest shall command that they empty the house , before the priest go into it to see the plague , that all that is in the house be not made unclean : and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house :
and he shall look on the plague , and , behold , if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes , greenish or reddish , which in sight are lower than the wall ;
and the priest shall come again the seventh day , and shall look : and , behold , if the plague be spread in the walls of the house ;
and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about , and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place :
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other morter , and shall plaister the house .
and if the plague come again , and break out in the house , after that he hath taken away the stones , and after he hath scraped the house , and after it is plaistered ;
then the priest shall come and look , and , behold , if the plague be spread in the house , it is a fretting leprosy in the house : it is unclean .
and he shall break down the house , the stones of it , and the timber thereof , and all the morter of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place .
and if the priest shall come in , and look upon it , and , behold , the plague hath not spread in the house , after the house was plaistered : then the priest shall pronounce the house clean , because the plague is healed .
and he shall take the cedar wood , and the hyssop , and the scarlet , and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the slain bird , and in the running water , and sprinkle the house seven times :
and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird , and with the running water , and with the living bird , and with the cedar wood , and with the hyssop , and with the scarlet :
and this shall be his uncleanness in his issue : whether his flesh run with his issue , or his flesh be stopped from his issue , it is his uncleanness .
and whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue , and hath not rinsed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .

speak unto Aaron , and unto his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them ; This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded , saying ,
what man soever there be of the house of Israel , that killeth an ox , or lamb , or goat , in the camp , or that killeth it out of the camp ,
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , to offer an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord ; blood shall be imputed unto that man ; he hath shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people :
to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices , which they offer in the open field , even that they may bring them unto the Lord , unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , unto the priest , and offer them for peace offerings unto the Lord .
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , to offer it unto the Lord ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people .
and whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
for the life of the flesh is in the blood : and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an Atonement for your souls : for it is the blood that maketh an Atonement for the soul .
and whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten ; he shall even pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with dust .
after the doings of the land of Egypt , wherein ye dwelt , shall ye not do : and after the doings of the land of Canaan , whither I bring you , shall ye not do : neither shall ye walk in their ordinances .
therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance , that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs , which were committed before you , and that ye defile not yourselves therein : I am the Lord your God .
therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity , because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of THY field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of THY harvest .
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment : thou shalt not respect the person of the poor , nor honour the person of the mighty : but in righteousness shalt thou judge THY neighbour .

again , thou shalt say to the children of Israel , Whosoever he be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel , that giveth any of his seed unto Molech ; he shall surely be put to death : the people of the land shall stone him with stones .
and I will set my face against that man , and will cut him off from among his people ; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech , to defile my sanctuary , and to profane my holy name .
then I will set my face against that man , and against his family , and will cut him off , and all that go a whoring after him , to commit whoredom with Molech , from among their people .
and the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits , and after wizards , to go a whoring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall surely be put to death : they have wrought confusion ; their blood shall be upon them .
if a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a woman approach unto any beast , and lie down thereto , thou shalt kill the woman , and the beast : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness , and shall uncover her nakedness ; he hath discovered her fountain , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
but I have said unto you , Ye shall inherit their land , and I will give it unto you to possess it , a land that floweth with milk and honey : I am the Lord your God , which have separated you from other people .

they shall not take a wife that is a whore , or profane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his God .
and he that is the high priest among his brethren , upon whose head the anointing oil was poured , and that is consecrated to put on the garments , shall not uncover his head , nor rend his clothes ;
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor profane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him : I am the Lord .
for whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish , he shall not approach : a blind man , or a lame , or he that hath a flat nose , or any thing superfluous ,
only he shall not go in unto the vail , nor come nigh unto the altar , because he hath a blemish ; that he profane not my sanctuaries : for I the Lord do sanctify them .
speak unto Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me : I am the Lord .
say unto them , Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations , that goeth unto the holy things , which the children of Israel hallow unto the Lord , having his uncleanness upon him , that soul shall be cut off from my presence : I am the Lord .

but if the priest buy any soul with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
neither from a stranger 's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these ; because their corruption is in them , and blemishes be in them : they shall not be accepted for you .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land which I give unto you , and shall reap the harvest thereof , then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest :
and ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath , from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering ; seven sabbaths shall be complete :
and ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year , and one young bullock , and two rams : they shall be for a burnt offering unto the Lord , with their meat offering , and their drink offerings , even an offering made by fire , of sweet savour unto the Lord .
and ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day , that it may be an holy convocation unto you : ye shall do no servile work therein : it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of THY field when thou reapest , neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of THY harvest : thou shalt leave them unto the poor , and to the stranger : I am the Lord your God .
also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of Atonement : it shall be an holy convocation unto you ; and ye shall afflict your souls , and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of Atonement , to make an Atonement for you before the Lord your God .

seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord : on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you ; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord : it is a solemn assembly ; and ye shall do no servile work therein .
also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land , ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days : on the first day shall be a sabbath , and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath .
and ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees , branches of palm trees , and the boughs of thick trees , and willows of the Brook ; and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days .
and the son of an Israelitish woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp ;
and the Israelitish woman 's son blasphemed the name of the Lord , and Cursed . and they brought him unto Moses : ( and his mother 's name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan : )
and he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord , he shall surely be put to death , and all the Congregation shall certainly stone him : as well the stranger , as he that is born in the land , when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord , shall be put to death .
that which groweth of its own accord of THY harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of THY vine undressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .

and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof , and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it : for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee .
and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
if THY brother be waxen poor , and hath sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kin come to redeem it , then shall he redeem that which his brother sold .
and if a man purchase of the Levites , then the house that was sold , and the city of his possession , shall go out in the year of jubile : for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
both THY bondmen , and THY bondmaids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you , of them shall ye buy , and of their families that are with you , which they begat in your land : and they shall be your possession .
and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you , to inherit them for a possession ; they shall be your bondmen for ever : but over your brethren the children of Israel , ye shall not rule one over another with rigour .
and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile , then he shall count with him , and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption .
then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bondmen ; and I have broken the bands of your yoke , and made you go upright .
and if ye shall despise my statutes , or if your soul abhor my judgments , so that ye will not do all my commandments , but that ye break my Covenant :
and I will set my face against you , and ye shall be slain before your enemies : they that hate you shall reign over you ; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you .
and your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
I will also send wild beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be desolate .
and I will bring a sword upon you , that shall avenge the quarrel of my Covenant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , I will send the pestilence among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
and when I have broken the staff of your bread , ten women shall bake your bread in one oven , and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfied .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it were before a sword , when none pursueth : and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies .
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies ' lands ; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them .
and that I also have walked contrary unto them , and have brought them into the land of their enemies ; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled , and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity :
the land also shall be left of them , and shall enjoy her sabbaths , while she lieth desolate without them : and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity : because , even because they despised my judgments , and because their soul abhorred my statutes .
and THY estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old , even THY estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary .

and if it be from a month old even unto five years old , then THY estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver , and for the female THY estimation shall be three shekels of silver .
and if it be any unclean beast , of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the Lord , then he shall present the beast before the priest :
and if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of THY estimation unto it , and it shall be assured to him .
in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong .

and they shall take all the instruments of ministry , wherewith they minister in the sanctuary , and put them in a cloth of blue , and cover them with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put them on a bar :
and they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof , wherewith they minister about it , even the censers , the fleshhooks , and the shovels , and the basons , all the vessels of the altar ; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers ' skins , and put to the staves of it .
from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them ; all that enter in to perform the service , to do the work in the tabernacle of the Congregation .
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the Congregation : and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them , every one that entereth into the service , to do the work of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and this is the charge of their burden , according to all their service in the tabernacle of the Congregation ; the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and sockets thereof ,
and the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cords , with all their instruments , and with all their service : and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Merari , according to all their service , in the tabernacle of the Congregation , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
these were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites , all that might do service in the tabernacle of the Congregation , which Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
even those that were numbered of them , throughout their families , by the house of their fathers , were two thousand and six hundred and thirty .
these are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon , of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the Congregation , whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the Lord .
then they shall confess their sin which they have done : and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed .
and a man lie with her carnally , and it be hid from the eyes of her husband , and be kept close , and she be defiled , and there be no witness against her , neither she be taken with the manner ;
and the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be Jealous of his wife , and she be defiled : or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be Jealous of his wife , and she be not defiled :
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel ; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water :
and the priest shall set the woman before the Lord , and uncover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse :
but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of THY husband , and if thou be defiled , and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband :
then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing , and the priest shall say unto the woman , The Lord make thee a curse and an oath among THY people , when the Lord doth make THY thigh to rot , and THY belly to swell ;
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the Lord , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no rasor come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord , he shall be holy , and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow .
and if any man die very suddenly by him , and he hath defiled the head of his consecration ; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing , on the seventh day shall he shave it .
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an Atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
and he shall consecrate unto the Lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled .
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord , with the basket of unleavened bread : the priest shall offer also his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and shall take the hair of the head of his separation , and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings .
and it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle , and had anointed it , and sanctified it , and all the instruments thereof , both the altar and all the vessels thereof , and had anointed them , and sanctified them ;
and the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes offered their offering before the altar .
and his offering was one silver charger , the weight thereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them were full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering :
he offered for his offering one silver charger , the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering :

and all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were twenty and four bullocks , the rams sixty , the he goats sixty , the lambs of the first year sixty . this was the dedication of the altar , after that it was anointed .
and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold , unto the Shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the Lord had shewed Moses , so he made the candlestick .
and the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks : and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , unto the Lord , to make an Atonement for the Levites .
for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel ; instead of such as open every womb , even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel , have I taken them unto me .
and Moses , and Aaron , and all the Congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Levites according unto all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
and after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the Congregation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did they unto them .
and the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
in the fourteenth day of this month , at even , ye shall keep it in his appointed season : according to all the rites of it , and according to all the ceremonies thereof , shall ye keep it .
and there were certain men , who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the passover on that day : and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said unto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
but the man that is clean , and is not in a journey , and forbeareth to keep the passover , even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people : because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle , namely , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
at the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel journeyed , and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched : as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents .
and so it was , when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle ; according to the commandment of the Lord they abode in their tents , and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed .
or whether it were two days , or a month , or a year , that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle , remaining thereon , the children of Israel abode in their tents , and journeyed not : but when it was taken up , they journeyed .
at the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents , and at the commandment of the Lord they journeyed : they kept the charge of the Lord , at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
make thee two trumpets of silver ; of a whole piece shalt thou make them : that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly , and for the journeying of the camps .
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets ; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God , and ye shall be saved from your enemies .
and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies : and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward , which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts : and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai .
and it shall be , if thou go with us , yea , it shall be , that what Goodness the Lord shall do unto us , the same will we do unto thee .
and they departed from the mount of the Lord three days ' journey : and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and when the people complained , it displeased the Lord : and the Lord heard it ; and his anger was kindled ; and the fire of the Lord burnt among them , and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp .
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in pans , and made cakes of it : and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil .
and if thou deal thus with me , kill me , I pray thee , out of hand , if I have found favour in THY sight ; and let me not see my wretchedness .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the Congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and I will come down and talk with thee there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thyself alone .
but even a whole month , until it come out at your nostrils , and it be loathsome unto you : because that ye have despised the Lord which is among you , and have wept before him , saying , Why came we forth out of Egypt ?
and the Lord came down in a cloud , and spake unto him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it unto the seventy elders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they prophesied , and did not cease .
and there went forth a wind from the Lord , and brought quails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , as it were a day 's journey on this side , and as it were a day 's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth .
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the quails : he that gathered least gathered ten homers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ERE it was chewed , the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people , and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague .
( now the man Moses was very meek , above all the men which were upon the face of the earth . )
and the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam : and they both came forth .
with him will I speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches ; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold : wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ?
and Aaron said unto Moses , Alas , my lord , I beseech thee , lay not the sin upon us , wherein we have done foolishly , and wherein we have sinned .
and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they dwell in , whether in tents , or in strong holds ;
and they ascended by the south , and came unto Hebron ; where Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were . ( now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
and they came unto the Brook of Eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the pomegranates , and of the figs .
and they went and came to Moses , and to Aaron , and to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , unto the wilderness of Paran , to Kadesh ; and brought back word unto them , and unto all the Congregation , and shewed them the fruit of the land .
the Amalekites dwell in the land of the south : and the Hittites , and the Jebusites , and the Amorites , dwell in the mountains : and the Canaanites dwell by the sea , and by the coast of Jordan .
and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole Congregation said unto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this wilderness !
because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hearkened to my voice ;
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , which have murmured against me ,
doubtless ye shall not come into the land , concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein , save Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of nun .
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even forty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your iniquities , even forty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
and they rose up early in the morning , and gat them up into the top of the mountain , saying , Lo , we be here , and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised : for we have sinned .
and will make an offering by fire unto the Lord , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in your solemn feasts , to make a sweet savour unto the Lord , of the herd , or of the flock :
Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering : as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor , so shall ye heave it .
then it shall be , if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the Congregation , that all the Congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour unto the Lord , with his meat offering , and his drink offering , according to the manner , and one kid of the goats for a sin offering .
and the priest shall make an Atonement for all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord , and their sin offering before the Lord , for their ignorance :
and the priest shall make an Atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord , to make an Atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them .
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the Lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue :
and it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandments of the Lord , and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a whoring :
and put fire therein , and put incense in them before the Lord to morrow : and it shall be that the man whom the Lord doth choose , he shall be holy : ye take too much upon you , ye sons of Levi .
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us ?
so they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that appertained unto Korah , and all their goods .
and it came to pass , when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tabernacle of the Congregation : and , behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of the Lord appeared .
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the Congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an Atonement for the people .
speak unto the children of Israel , and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers , of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods : write thou every man 's name upon his rod .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's rod , whom I shall choose , shall blossom : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , whereby they murmur against you .
and Moses spake unto the children of Israel , and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
and it came to pass , that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness ; and , behold , the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded , and brought forth buds , and bloomed blossoms , and yielded almonds .
and they shall keep THY charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the Congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
and I , behold , I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and the Lord spake unto Aaron , behold , I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel ; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing , and to THY sons , by an ordinance for ever .
this shall be thine of the most holy things , reserved from the fire : every oblation of theirs , every meat offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs , which they shall render unto me , shall be most holy for thee and for THY sons .
all the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the Lord , them have I given thee .
and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem , according to thine estimation , for the money of five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary , which is twenty gerahs .
and , behold , I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance , for their service which they serve , even the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
but the tithes of the children of Israel , which they offer as an heave offering unto the Lord , I have given to the Levites to inherit : therefore I have said unto them , Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
thus speak unto the Levites , and say unto them , When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord , even a tenth part of the tithe .
and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you , as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor , and as the fulness of the winepress .
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the Lord of all your tithes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the Lord 's heave offering to Aaron the priest .
therefore thou shalt say unto them , When ye have heaved the best thereof from it , then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor , and as the increase of the winepress .
this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded , saying , Speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein is no blemish , and upon which never came yoke :
and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest , that he may bring her forth without the camp , and one shall slay her before his face :
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : and it shall be unto the children of Israel , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them , for a statute for ever .
he shall purify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead , and purifieth not himself , defileth the tabernacle of the Lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel : because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him , he shall be unclean ; his uncleanness is yet upon him .
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
but the man that shall be unclean , and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from among the Congregation , because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the Lord : the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him ; he is unclean .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole Congregation , into the desert of Zin in the first month : and the people abode in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us in unto this evil place ? it is no place of seed , or of figs , or of vines , or of pomegranates ; neither is there any water to drink .
and Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and they fell upon their faces : and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them .
and when we cried unto the Lord , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and hath brought us forth out of Egypt : and , behold , we are in Kadesh , a city in the uttermost of THY border :
Aaron shall be gathered unto his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel , because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah .
and when king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea , to compass the land of Edom : and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way .
therefore the people came to Moses , and said , We have sinned , for we have spoken against the Lord , and against thee ; pray unto the Lord , that he take away the Serpents from us . and Moses prayed for the people .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Make thee a fiery serpent , and set it upon a pole : and it shall come to pass , that every one that is bitten , when he looketh upon it , shall live .
and Moses made a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole , and it came to pass , that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he beheld the serpent of brass , he lived .
from thence they removed , and pitched on the other side of Arnon , which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites : for Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
let me pass through THY land : we will not turn into the fields , or into the vineyards ; we will not drink of the waters of the well : but we will go along by the king 's high way , until we be past THY borders .
and Israel smote him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok , even unto the children of Ammon : for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
for Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto Arnon .
for there is a fire gone out of Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sihon : it hath consumed Ar of Moab , and the lords of the high places of Arnon .
and they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at Edrei .
and the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto Balaam , and spake unto him the words of Balak .
and God 's anger was kindled because he went : and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam smote the ass , to turn her into the way .
and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he smote her again .
and the angel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she fell down under Balaam : and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he smote the ass with a staff .
then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and when Balak heard that Balaam was come , he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab , which is in the border of Arnon , which is in the utmost coast .
for from the top of the rocks I see him , and from the hills I behold him : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
behold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drink the blood of the slain .
he shall pour the water out of his buckets , and his seed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than Agag , and his kingdom shall be exalted .
God brought him forth out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn : he shall eat up the nations his enemies , and shall break their bones , and Pierce them through with his arrows .
and Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together : and Balak said unto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
and , behold , one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses , and in the sight of all the Congregation of the children of Israel , who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and when Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he rose up from among the Congregation , and took a javelin in his hand ;
now the name of the Israelite that was slain , even that was slain with the Midianitish woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites .
and the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was head over a people , and of a chief house in Midian .
these are the families of the Reubenites : and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty .
and the sons of Eliab ; Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . this is that Dathan and Abiram , which were famous in the Congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against the Lord :
and the sons of Judah after their families were ; of Shelah , the family of the Shelanites : of Pharez , the family of the Pharzites : of Zerah , the family of the Zarhites .
of the sons of Zebulun after their families : of Sered , the family of the Sardites : of Elon , the family of the Elonites : of Jahleel , the family of the Jahleelites .
these are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those that were numbered of them , thirty and two thousand and five hundred . these are the sons of Joseph after their families .
these are the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered of them ; who were fifty and three thousand and four hundred .
to many thou shalt give the more inheritance , and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance : to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him .
and these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their families : of Gershon , the family of the Gershonites : of Kohath , the family of the Kohathites : of Merari , the family of the Merarites .
these are the families of the Levites : the family of the Libnites , the family of the Hebronites , the family of the Mahlites , the family of the Mushites , the family of the Korathites . and Kohath begat Amram .
and the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt : and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
and those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand , all males from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of Israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel .
our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
the daughters of Zelophehad speak right : thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father 's brethren ; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter .
for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin , in the strife of the Congregation , to sanctify me at the water before their eyes : that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin .
which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the Congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd .
and he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the Congregation .
and the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb : in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the Lord for a drink offering .
and their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock , and the third part of an hin unto a ram , and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb : this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
after this manner ye shall offer daily , throughout the seven days , the meat of the sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord : it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
also in the day of the firstfruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the Lord , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
these things ye shall do unto the Lord in your set feasts , beside your vows , and your freewill offerings , for your burnt offerings , and for your meat offerings , and for your drink offerings , and for your peace offerings .
if a man vow a vow unto the Lord , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth .
and her father hear her vow , and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul , and her father shall hold his peace at her : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand .
but if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth ; not any of her vows , or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul , shall stand : and the Lord shall forgive her , because her father disallowed her .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it ; then he shall make her vow which she vowed , and that which she uttered with her lips , wherewith she bound her soul , of none effect : and the Lord shall forgive her .
but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them ; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her soul , shall not stand : her husband hath made them void ; and the Lord shall forgive her .
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day ; then he establisheth all her vows , or all her bonds , which are upon her : he confirmeth them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
and Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
and they slew the kings of Midian , beside the rest of them that were slain ; namely , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
and they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , unto Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and unto the Congregation of the children of Israel , unto the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by Jordan near Jericho .
and Moses was wroth with the officers of the host , with the captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
and divide the prey into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the Congregation :
and levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the beeves , and of the asses , and of the sheep :
and the booty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
and the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep :
( now the half that pertained unto the Congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep ,
even of the children of Israel 's half , Moses took one portion of fifty , both of man and of beast , and gave them unto the Levites , which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and the officers which were over thousands of the host , the captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , came near unto Moses :
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels .
now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle : and when they saw the land of Jazer , and the land of Gilead , that , behold , the place was a place for cattle ;
for when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them .
and the Lord 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the Lord , was consumed .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them unto their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
and the land be subdued before the Lord : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the Lord , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
and Moses gave unto them , even to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land , with the cities thereof in the coasts , even the cities of the country round about .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
and they departed from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians .
and they departed from before Pi @-@ hahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness , and went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and pitched in Marah .
and Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their molten images , and quite pluck down all their high places :
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you ; then it shall come to pass , that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes , and thorns in your sides , and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land of Canaan ; ( this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof : )
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass on to Zin : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh @-@ barnea , and shall go on to Hazar @-@ addar , and pass on to Azmon :
and the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
from mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad :
and the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall descend , and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward :
for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers , and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers , have received their inheritance ; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance :
command the children of Israel , that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them .
and the suburbs of the cities , which ye shall give unto the Levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about .
and among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge , which ye shall appoint for the manslayer , that he may flee thither : and to them ye shall add forty and two cities .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their suburbs .
Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan , which shall be cities of refuge .
and the Congregation shall deliver the Slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood , and the Congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge , whither he was fled : and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest , which was anointed with the holy oil .
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the Slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
Whoso killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge , that he should come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spake before Moses , and before the princes , the chief fathers of the children of Israel :
and they said , The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
and when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
this is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
and every daughter , that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel , shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers .
and it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spake unto the children of Israel , according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them ;
( the Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and bless you , as he hath promised you ! )
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us .
and ye murmured in your tents , and said , Because the Lord hated us , he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
moreover your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil , they shall go in thither , and unto them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
and command thou the people , saying , Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau , which dwell in Seir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore :
Ye shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau , which dwelt in Seir , through the way of the plain from Elath , and from Ezion @-@ gaber , we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
and the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim , even unto Azzah , the Caphtorims , which came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead . )
rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river Arnon : behold , I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land : begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
this day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven , who shall hear report of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of thee .
and we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed the men , and the women , and the little ones , of every city , we left none to remain :
from Aroer , which is by the brink of the river of Arnon , and from the city that is by the river , even unto Gilead , there was not one city too strong for us : the Lord our God delivered all unto us :
only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not , nor unto any place of the river Jabbok , nor unto the cities in the mountains , nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbad us .
and the Lord said unto me , Fear him not : for I will deliver him , and all his people , and his land , into THY hand ; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites , which dwelt at Heshbon .
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon ;
and the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , being the kingdom of Og , gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , with all Bashan , which was called the land of giants .
and unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley , and the border even unto the river Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
O Lord God , thou hast begun to shew THY servant THY greatness , and THY mighty hand : for what God is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to THY works , and according to THY might ?
get thee up into the top of Pisgah , and lift up thine eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and behold it with thine eyes : for thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you .
only take heed to thyself , and keep THY soul diligently , lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen , and lest they depart from THY heart all the days of THY life : but teach them THY sons , and THY sons ' sons ;
furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , and sware that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in unto that good land , which the Lord THY God giveth thee for an inheritance :
take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the Covenant of the Lord your God , which he made with you , and make you a Graven image , or the likeness of any thing , which the Lord THY God hath forbidden thee .
when thou art in tribulation , and all these things are come upon thee , even in the latter days , if thou turn to the Lord THY God , and shalt be obedient unto his voice ;
out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might instruct thee : and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire ; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire .
and because he loved THY fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt ;
that the Slayer might flee thither , which should kill his neighbour unawares , and hated him not in times past ; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live :
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgments , which Moses spake unto the children of Israel , after they came forth out of Egypt ,
( I stood between the Lord and you at that time , to shew you the work of the Lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
Thou shalt not make thee any Graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the waters beneath the earth :
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt , and that the Lord THY God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm : therefore the Lord THY God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day .
and it came to pass , when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , ( for the mountain did burn with fire , ) that ye came near unto me , even all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ;
and ye said , behold , the Lord our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that God doth talk with man , and he liveth .
go thou near , and hear all that the Lord our God shall say : and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee ; and we will hear it , and do it .
and the Lord heard the voice of your words , when ye spake unto me ; and the Lord said unto me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken unto thee : they have well said all that they have spoken .
Ye shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess .
that thou mightest fear the Lord THY God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command thee , thou , and THY son , and THY son 's son , all the days of THY life ; and that THY days may be prolonged .
hear therefore , O Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase mightily , as the Lord God of THY fathers hath promised thee , in the land that floweth with milk and honey .
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto THY children , and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
( for the Lord THY God is a Jealous God among you ) lest the anger of the Lord THY God be kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the Lord sware unto THY fathers ,
but because the Lord loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
Wherefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgments , and keep , and do them , that the Lord THY God shall keep unto thee the Covenant and the mercy which he sware unto THY fathers :
and the Lord will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee ; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
and thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord THY God shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
and the Lord THY God will put out those nations before thee by little and little : thou mayest not consume them at once , lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee .
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
then thine heart be lifted up , and thou forget the Lord THY God , which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage ;
but thou shalt remember the Lord THY God : for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his Covenant which he sware unto THY fathers , as it is this day .
remember , and forget not , how thou provokedst the Lord THY God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt , until ye came unto this place , ye have been rebellious against the Lord .
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant which the Lord made with you , then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
and the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them was written according to all the words , which the Lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant .
and the Lord said unto me , arise , get thee down quickly from hence ; for THY people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a molten image .
and I looked , and , behold , ye had sinned against the Lord your God , and had made you a molten calf : ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you .
I prayed therefore unto the Lord , and said , O Lord God , destroy not THY people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed through THY greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say , Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them , and because he hated them , he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the Lord gave them unto me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his stead .
and know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm ,
and his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ;
and what he did unto the army of Egypt , unto their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how the Lord hath destroyed them unto this day ;
and that ye may prolong your days in the land , which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
for the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst THY seed , and wateredst it with THY foot , as a garden of herbs :
a land which the Lord THY God careth for : the eyes of the Lord THY God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in THY corn , and THY wine , and thine oil .
and then the Lord 's wrath be kindled against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you .
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul , and bind them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as frontlets between your eyes .
and ye shall teach them your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord THY God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim , and the curse upon mount Ebal .
are they not on the other side Jordan , by the way where the sun goeth down , in the land of the Canaanites , which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal , beside the plains of Moreh ?
these are the statutes and judgments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the Lord God of THY fathers giveth thee to possess it , all the days that ye live upon the earth .
Ye shall utterly destroy all the places , wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree :
and ye shall overthrow their altars , and break their pillars , and burn their groves with fire ; and ye shall hew down the Graven images of their gods , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
but unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there , even unto his habitation shall ye seek , and thither thou shalt come :
and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and heave offerings of your hand , and your vows , and your freewill offerings , and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks :
and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto , ye and your households , wherein the Lord THY God hath blessed thee .
but when ye go over Jordan , and dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit , and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about , so that ye dwell in safety ;
then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there ; thither shall ye bring all that I command you ; your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the heave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the Lord :
but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of THY tribes , there thou shalt offer THY burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
Thou mayest not eat within THY gates the tithe of THY corn , or of THY wine , or of THY oil , or the firstlings of THY herds or of THY flock , nor any of THY vows which thou vowest , nor THY freewill offerings , or heave offering of thine hand :
when the Lord THY God shall enlarge THY border , as he hath promised thee , and thou shalt say , I will eat flesh , because THY soul longeth to eat flesh ; thou mayest eat flesh , whatsoever THY soul lusteth after .
if the place which the Lord THY God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee , then thou shalt kill of THY herd and of THY flock , which the Lord hath given thee , as I have commanded thee , and thou shalt eat in THY gates whatsoever THY soul lusteth after .
and thou shalt offer THY burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the Lord THY God : and the blood of THY sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the Lord THY God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
when the Lord THY God shall cut off the nations from before thee , whither thou goest to possess them , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their land ;
Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord THY God : for every abomination to the Lord , which he hateth , have they done unto their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , whereof he spake unto thee , saying , Let us go after other gods , which thou hast not known , and let us serve them ;
Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams : for the Lord your God proveth you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord THY God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
then shalt thou inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought among you ;
Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein , and the cattle thereof , with the edge of the sword .
for thou art an holy people unto the Lord THY God , and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claws , and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the Lord THY God shall choose :
if there be among you a poor man of one of THY brethren within any of THY gates in THY land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thine heart , nor shut thine hand from THY poor brother :
Thou shalt surely give him , and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him : because that for this thing the Lord THY God shall bless thee in all THY works , and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto THY brother , to THY poor , and to THY needy , in THY land .
Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of THY flock , and out of THY floor , and out of THY winepress : of that wherewith the Lord THY God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the Lord THY God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there .
and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all THY coast seven days ; neither shall there anything of the flesh , which thou sacrificedst the first day at even , remain all night until the morning .
but at the place which the Lord THY God shall choose to place his name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even , at the going down of the sun , at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt .
and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord THY God shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto THY tents .
seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
and thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the Lord THY God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand , which thou shalt give unto the Lord THY God , according as the Lord THY God hath blessed thee :
and thou shalt rejoice in THY feast , thou , and THY son , and THY daughter , and THY manservant , and THY maidservant , and the Levite , the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that are within THY gates .
seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the Lord THY God in the place which the Lord shall choose : because the Lord THY God shall bless thee in all thine increase , and in all the works of thine hands , therefore thou shalt surely rejoice .
if there be found among you , within any of THY gates which the Lord THY God giveth thee , man or woman , that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord THY God , in transgressing his Covenant ,
and it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inquired diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought in Israel :
then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman , which have committed that wicked thing , unto THY gates , even that man or that woman , and shalt stone them with stones , till they die .
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he that is worthy of death be put to death ; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterward the hands of all the people . so thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within THY gates : then shalt thou arise , and get thee up into the place which the Lord THY God shall choose ;
and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those days , and inquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment :
and thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee :
according to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee , and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee , thou shalt do : thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee , to the right hand , nor to the left .
and the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the Lord THY God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
when thou art come unto the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , and shalt possess it , and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , I will set a king over me , like as all the nations that are about me ;
Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the Lord THY God shall choose : one from among THY brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which is not THY brother .
but he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you , Ye shall henceforth return no more that way .
and it shall be , when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites :
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the Lord his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them :
that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren , and that he turn not aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he , and his children , in the midst of Israel .
and this shall be the priest 's due from the people , from them that offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep ; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
and if a Levite come from any of THY gates out of all Israel , where he sojourned , and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the Lord shall choose ;
for these nations , which thou shalt possess , hearkened unto observers of times , and unto diviners : but as for thee , the Lord THY God hath not suffered thee so to do .
according to all that thou desiredst of the Lord THY God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren , like unto thee , and will put my words in his mouth ; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other gods , even that prophet shall die .
Thou shalt not remove THY neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the Lord THY God giveth thee to possess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sinneth : at the mouth of two witnesses , or at the mouth of three witnesses , shall the matter be established .
then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to have done unto his brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies , and seest horses , and chariots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the Lord THY God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and it shall be , when ye are come nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
and the officers shall speak unto the people , saying , What man is there that hath built a new house , and hath not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and the officers shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted ? let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren 's heart faint as well as his heart .
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people , that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
but the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies , which the Lord THY God hath given thee .
and it shall be , that the city which is next unto the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take an heifer , which hath not been wrought with , and which hath not drawn in the yoke ;
and the priests the sons of Levi shall come near ; for them the Lord THY God hath chosen to minister unto him , and to bless in the name of the Lord ; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried :
and it shall be , if thou have no delight in her , then thou shalt let her go whither she will ; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money , thou shalt not make merchandise of her , because thou hast humbled her .
then it shall be , when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated , which is indeed the firstborn :
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;
in like manner shalt thou do with his ass ; and so shalt thou do with his raiment ; and with all lost thing of THY brother 's , which he hath lost , and thou hast found , shalt thou do likewise : thou mayest not hide thyself .
the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord THY God .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
and give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an evil name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a maid :
then shall the father of the damsel , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel 's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate :
and they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver , and give them unto the father of the damsel , because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel : and she shall be his wife ; he may not put her away all his days .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and slayeth him , even so is this matter :
then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hath humbled her , he may not put her away all his days .
because they met you not with bread and with water in the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt ; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse thee .
if there be among you any man , that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night , then shall he go abroad out of the camp , he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening cometh on , he shall wash himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
and thou shalt have a paddle upon THY weapon ; and it shall be , when thou wilt ease thyself abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee :
for the Lord THY God walketh in the midst of THY camp , to deliver thee , and to give up thine enemies before thee ; therefore shall THY camp be holy : that he see no unclean thing in thee , and turn away from thee .
he shall dwell with thee , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of THY gates , where it liketh him best : thou shalt not oppress him .
Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the Lord THY God for any vow : for even both these are abomination unto the Lord THY God .
unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury ; but unto THY brother thou shalt not lend upon usury : that the Lord THY God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
that which is gone out of THY lips thou shalt keep and perform ; even a freewill offering , according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord THY God , which thou hast promised with THY mouth .
when thou comest into THY neighbour 's vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes THY fill at thine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in THY vessel .
when thou comest into the standing corn of THY neighbour , then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand ; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto THY neighbour 's standing corn .
when a man hath taken a wife , and married her , and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes , because he hath found some uncleanness in her : then let him write her a bill of divorcement , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
and if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorcement , and giveth it in her hand , and sendeth her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , which sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for that is abomination before the Lord : and thou shalt not cause the land to sin , which the Lord THY God giveth thee for an inheritance .
when a man hath taken a new wife , he shall not go out to war , neither shall he be charged with any business : but he shall be free at home one year , and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken .
if a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel , and maketh merchandise of him , or selleth him ; then that thief shall die ; and thou shalt put evil away from among you .
take heed in the plague of leprosy , that thou observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them , so ye shall observe to do .
at his day thou shalt give him his hire , neither shall the sun go down upon it ; for he is poor , and setteth his heart upon it : lest he cry against thee unto the Lord , and it be sin unto thee .
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
when thou gatherest the grapes of THY vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
forty stripes he may give him , and not exceed : lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then THY brother should seem vile unto thee .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him , and putteth forth her hand , and taketh him by the secrets :
how he met thee by the way , and smote the hindmost of thee , even all that were feeble behind thee , when thou wast faint and weary ; and he feared not God .
and it shall be , when thou art come in unto the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee for an inheritance , and possessest it , and dwellest therein ;
that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth , which thou shalt bring of THY land that the Lord THY God giveth thee , and shalt put it in a basket , and shalt go unto the place which the Lord THY God shall choose to place his name there .
and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , I profess this day unto the Lord THY God , that I am come unto the country which the Lord sware unto our fathers for to give us .
and now , behold , I have brought the firstfruits of the land , which thou , O Lord , hast given me . and thou shalt set it before the Lord THY God , and worship before the Lord THY God :
and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord THY God hath given unto thee , and unto thine house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger that is among you .
Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be THY God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and to hearken unto his voice :
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaister them with plaister :
therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in mount Ebal , and thou shalt plaister them with plaister .
and it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord THY God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the Lord THY God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth :
blessed shall be the fruit of THY body , and the fruit of THY ground , and the fruit of THY cattle , the increase of THY kine , and the flocks of THY sheep .
and all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord ; and they shall be afraid of thee .
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord THY God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
the Lord shall smite thee with a consumption , and with a fever , and with an inflammation , and with an extreme burning , and with the sword , and with blasting , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish .
the Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt , and with the emerods , and with the scab , and with the itch , whereof thou canst not be healed .
Thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently taken away from before THY face , and shall not be restored to thee : THY sheep shall be given unto thine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
THY sons and THY daughters shall be given unto another people , and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in thine hand .
the fruit of THY land , and all THY labours , shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway :
the Lord shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that cannot be healed , from the sole of THY foot unto the top of THY head .
and he shall besiege thee in all THY gates , until THY high and fenced walls come down , wherein thou trustedst , throughout all THY land : and he shall besiege thee in all THY gates throughout all THY land , which the Lord THY God hath given thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of THY sons and of THY daughters , which the Lord THY God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee :
so that the man that is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat : because he hath nothing left him in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all THY gates .
if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name , the Lord THY God ;
then the Lord will make THY plagues wonderful , and the plagues of THY seed , even great plagues , and of long continuance , and sore sicknesses , and of long continuance .
and it shall come to pass , that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you ; so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to nought ; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it .
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of THY foot have rest : but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
in the morning thou shalt say , Would God it were even ! and at even thou shalt say , Would God it were morning ! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear , and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
these are the words of the Covenant , which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , beside the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
and Moses called unto all Israel , and said unto them , Ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh , and unto all his servants , and unto all his land ;
that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself , and that he may be unto thee a God , as he hath said unto thee , and as he hath sworn unto THY fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you , and the stranger that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses which the Lord hath laid upon it ;
then men shall say , Because they have forsaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations , whither the Lord THY God hath driven thee ,
and shalt return unto the Lord THY God , and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day , thou and THY children , with all thine heart , and with all THY soul ;
that then the Lord THY God will turn THY captivity , and have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all the nations , whither the Lord THY God hath scattered thee .
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven , from thence will the Lord THY God gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
and the Lord THY God will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of THY seed , to love the Lord THY God with all thine heart , and with all THY soul , that thou mayest live .
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord THY God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the Lord THY God with all thine heart , and with all THY soul .
I denounce unto you this day , that ye shall surely perish , and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land , whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it .
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the Lord hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
the Lord THY God , he will go over before thee , and he will destroy these nations from before thee , and thou shalt possess them : and Joshua , he shall go over before thee , as the Lord hath said .
and the Lord shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og , kings of the Amorites , and unto the land of them , whom he destroyed .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi , which bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , and unto all the elders of Israel .
when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord THY God in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and THY stranger that is within THY gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the Lord your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
and that their children , which have not known any thing , may hear , and learn to fear the Lord your God , as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it .
and I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought , in that they are turned unto other gods .
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers , that floweth with milk and honey ; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves , and waxen fat ; then will they turn unto other gods , and serve them , and provoke me , and break my Covenant .
and it came to pass , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
when the most High divided to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the sons of Adam , he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel .
he made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ;
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God ; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities : and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people ; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
I will make mine arrows drunk with blood , and my sword shall devour flesh ; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives , from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy .
get thee up into this mountain Abarim , unto mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession :
and die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto THY people ; as Aaron THY brother died in mount Hor , and was gathered unto his people :
because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah @-@ Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof , and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush : let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph , and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren .
they shall call the people unto the mountain ; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness : for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas , and of treasures hid in the sand .
and Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho . and the Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead , unto Dan ,
and the Lord said unto him , This is the land which I sware unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , saying , I will give it unto THY seed : I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes , but thou shalt not go over thither .
and Joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom ; for Moses had laid his hands upon him : and the children of Israel hearkened unto him , and did as the Lord commanded Moses .
now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass , that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun , Moses ' minister , saying ,
from the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
this book of the law shall not depart out of THY mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make THY way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
Whosoever he be that doth rebel against THY commandment , and will not hearken unto THY words in all that thou commandest him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : whither the men went I wot not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall overtake them .
but she had brought them up to the roof of the house , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order upon the roof .
behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by : and thou shalt bring THY father , and THY mother , and THY brethren , and all THY father 's household , home unto thee .
and they commanded the people , saying , When ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God , and the priests the Levites bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
and Joshua spake unto the priests , saying , Take up the Ark of the Covenant , and pass over before the people . and they took up the Ark of the Covenant , and went before the people .
and Joshua said , Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Hivites , and the Perizzites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Jebusites .
and as they that bare the Ark were come unto Jordan , and the feet of the priests that bare the Ark were dipped in the brim of the water , ( for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest , )
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over , that the Ark of the Lord passed over , and the priests , in the presence of the people .
and it came to pass , when the priests that bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of Jordan , and the soles of the priests ' feet were lifted up unto the dry land , that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place , and flowed over all his banks , as they did before .
for the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the Lord your God did to the Red sea , which he dried up from before us , until we were gone over :
and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
now all the people that came out were circumcised : but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circumcised .
and it came to pass , when they had done circumcising all the people , that they abode in their places in the camp , till they were whole .
and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land ; neither had the children of Israel manna any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
and it came to pass , when Joshua had spoken unto the people , that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns passed on before the Lord , and blew with the trumpets : and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them .
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the dawning of the day , and compassed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they compassed the city seven times .
and the city shall be accursed , even it , and all that are therein , to the Lord : only Rahab the harlot shall live , she and all that are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
and ye , in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing , lest ye make yourselves accursed , when ye take of the accursed thing , and make the camp of Israel a curse , and trouble it .
and the young men that were spies went in , and brought Rahab , and her father , and her mother , and her brethren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kindred , and left them without the camp of Israel .
and they burnt the city with fire , and all that was therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord .
and Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive , and her father 's household , and all that she had ; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day ; because she hid the messengers , which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing : for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , took of the accursed thing : and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel .
and Joshua sent men from Jericho to AI , which is beside Beth @-@ aven , on the east side of Bethel , and spake unto them , saying , Go up and view the country . and the men went up and viewed AI .
and Joshua said , Alas , O Lord God , wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us ? would to God we had been content , and dwelt on the other side Jordan !
and it shall be , that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire , he and all that he hath : because he hath transgressed the Covenant of the Lord , and because he hath wrought Folly in Israel .
and he brought his household man by man ; and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was taken .
and they took them out of the midst of the tent , and brought them unto Joshua , and unto all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up against AI : and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour , and sent them away by night .
and I , and all the people that are with me , will approach unto the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
( for they will come out after us ) till we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do . see , I have commanded you .
and all the people , even the people of war that were with him , went up , and drew nigh , and came before the city , and pitched on the north side of AI : now there was a valley between them and AI .
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
and all the people that were in AI were called together to pursue after them : and they pursued after Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
and the Lord said unto Joshua , Stretch out the spear that is in THY hand toward AI ; for I will give it into thine hand . and Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city .
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
and the other issued out of the city against them ; so they were in the midst of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side : and they smote them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
and it came to pass , when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of AI in the field , in the wilderness wherein they chased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all the Israelites returned unto AI , and smote it with the edge of the sword .
they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and it is mouldy :
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they dwelt among them .
therefore the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their hosts , and encamped before Gibeon , and made war against it .
and it came to pass , when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter , till they were consumed , that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
and that day Joshua took Makkedah , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof he utterly destroyed , them , and all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain : and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho .
and the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
and they took it on that day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
and they took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof , and all the souls that were therein ; he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but destroyed it utterly , and all the souls that were therein .
and it came to pass , when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , and to the king of Shimron , and to the king of Achshaph ,
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the plains south of Chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the borders of Dor on the west ,
and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the mountains , and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh .
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude , with horses and chariots very many .
and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel , who smote them , and chased them unto great Zidon , and unto Misrephoth @-@ maim , and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward ; and they smote them , until they left them none remaining .
and all the cities of those kings , and all the kings of them , did Joshua take , and smote them with the edge of the sword , and he utterly destroyed them , as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded .
and all the spoil of these cities , and the cattle , the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves ; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them , neither left they any to breathe .
for it was of the Lord to harden their hearts , that they should come against Israel in battle , that he might destroy them utterly , and that they might have no favour , but that he might destroy them , as the Lord commanded Moses .
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smote , and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon , and all the plain on the east :
them did Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smite : and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
from Aroer , that is upon the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon ;
and their coast was from Aroer , that is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by Medeba ;
and the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan , and the border thereof . this was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families , the cities and the villages thereof .
and Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh : and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families .
and half Gilead , and Ashtaroth , and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan , were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh , even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families .
and these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel , distributed for inheritance to them .
forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh @-@ barnea to espy out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
and now , behold , the Lord hath kept me alive , as he said , these forty and five years , even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses , while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness : and now , lo , I am this day fourscore and five years old .
as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families ; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast .
and it went out to the south side to Maaleh @-@ acrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh @-@ barnea , and passed along to Hezron , and went up to Adar , and fetched a compass to Karkaa :
from thence it passed toward Azmon , and went out unto the river of Egypt ; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea : this shall be your south coast .
and the border went up to Beth @-@ hogla , and passed along by the north of Beth @-@ arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben :
and the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor , and so northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is before the going up to Adummim , which is on the south side of the river : and the border passed toward the waters of En @-@ shemesh , and the goings out thereof were at En @-@ rogel :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of mount Ephron ; and the border was drawn to Baalah , which is Kirjath @-@ jearim :
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth @-@ shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward : and the border was drawn to Shicron , and passed along to mount Baalah , and went out unto Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
and the west border was to the great sea , and the coast thereof . this is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families .
and goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti , unto the coast of Beth @-@ horon the nether , and to Gezer : and the goings out thereof are at the sea .
and the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus : even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth @-@ addar , unto Beth @-@ horon the upper ;
and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath @-@ shiloh , and passed by it on the east to Janohah ;
the border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah ; and the goings out thereof were at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families .
there was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh ; for he was the firstborn of Joseph ; to wit , for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead : because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
there was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families ; for the children of Abiezer , and for the children of Helek , and for the children of Asriel , and for the children of Shechem , and for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida : these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families .
but Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters , Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
and the coast descended unto the river Kanah , southward of the river : these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh : the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river , and the outgoings of it were at the sea :
southward it was Ephraim 's , and northward it was Manasseh 's , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in Asher on the north , and in Issachar on the east .
and Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth @-@ shean and her towns , and Ibleam and her towns , and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns , even three countries .
yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were waxen strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute ; but did not utterly drive them out .
and the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh , and set up the tabernacle of the Congregation there . and the land was subdued before them .
give out from among you three men for each tribe : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Judah shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north .
and the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families : and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
and their border on the north side was from Jordan ; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side , and went up through the mountains westward ; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth @-@ aven .
and the border went over from thence toward Luz , to the side of Luz , which is Bethel , southward ; and the border descended to Ataroth @-@ adar , near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Beth @-@ horon .
and the border was drawn thence , and compassed the corner of the sea southward , from the hill that lieth before Beth @-@ horon southward ; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath @-@ baal , which is Kirjath @-@ jearim , a city of the children of Judah : this was the west quarter .
and the south quarter was from the end of Kirjath @-@ jearim , and the border went out on the west , and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah :
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @-@ shemesh , and went forth toward Geliloth , which is over against the going up of Adummim , and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
and the border passed along to the side of Beth @-@ hoglah northward : and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan : this was the south coast .
out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon : for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them : therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them .
and turneth toward the sunrising to Beth @-@ dagon , and reacheth to Zebulun , and to the valley of Jiphthah @-@ el toward the north side of Beth @-@ Emek , and Neiel , and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand ,
and then the coast turneth to Ramah , and to the strong city Tyre ; and the coast turneth to Hosah ; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib :
and the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites : and the children of Aaron the priest , which were of the Levites , had by lot out of the tribe of Judah , and out of the tribe of Simeon , and out of the tribe of Benjamin , thirteen cities .
and the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , and out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh , ten cities .
and the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar , and out of the tribe of Asher , and out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan , thirteen cities .
the children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben , and out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun , twelve cities .
and they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi , had : for theirs was the first lot .
thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the Slayer ; and Libnah with her suburbs ,
and the families of the children of Kohath , the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim .
and unto the children of Gershon , of the families of the Levites , out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the Slayer ; and Beesh @-@ terah with her suburbs ; two cities .
and unto the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with her suburbs , and Kartah with her suburbs ,
and the Lord gave them rest round about , according to all that he sware unto their fathers : and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them ; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand .
now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan : but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward . and when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents , then he blessed them ,
and when they came unto the borders of Jordan , that are in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan , a great altar to see to .
and the children of Israel heard say , behold , the chidren of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan , in the borders of Jordan , at the passage of the children of Israel .
and when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up to war against them .
and the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
and they came unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , unto the land of Gilead , and they spake with them , saying ,
thus saith the whole Congregation of the Lord , What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that ye have builded you an altar , that ye might rebel this day against the Lord ?
but that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord ? and it will be , seeing ye rebel to day against the Lord , that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole Congregation of Israel .
that we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offerings thereon , let the Lord himself require it ;
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak unto our children , saying , What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
and when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the Congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake , it pleased them .
and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , unto the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
and the Lord your God , he shall expel them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall possess their land , as the Lord your God hath promised unto you .
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses , that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left ;
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
for the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day .
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cleave unto the remnant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you :
and when they cried unto the Lord , he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea upon them , and covered them ; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt : and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season .
and I brought you into the land of the Amorites , which dwelt on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might possess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
and ye went over Jordan , and came unto Jericho : and the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
and I sent the hornet before you , which drave them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; but not with THY sword , nor with THY bow .
and it came to pass after these things , that Joshua the son of nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua , and which had known all the works of the Lord , that he had done for Israel .
now after the death of Joshua it came to pass , that the children of Israel asked the Lord , saying , Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first , to fight against them ?
now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem , and had taken it , and smitten it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
and afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites , that dwelt in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
and the children of the Kenite , Moses ' father in law , went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah , which lieth in the south of Arad ; and they went and dwelt among the people .
and when he shewed them the entrance into the city , they smote the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let go the man and all his family .
neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth @-@ shean and her towns , nor Taanach and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns : but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth @-@ shemesh , nor the inhabitants of Beth @-@ anath ; but he dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth @-@ shemesh and of Beth @-@ anath became tributaries unto them .
and an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim , and said , I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers ; and I said , I will never break my Covenant with you .
and it came to pass , when the angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord , that he did for Israel .
and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the people that were round about them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the Lord to anger .
and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
Whithersoever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for evil , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworn unto them : and they were greatly distressed .
and yet they would not hearken unto their judges , but they went a whoring after other gods , and bowed themselves unto them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in , obeying the commandments of the Lord ; but they did not so .
and when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord .
but when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised them up a deliverer , Ehud the son of Gera , a Benjamite , a man lefthanded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab .
and Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlour , which he had for himself alone . and Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . and he arose out of his seat .
and they tarried till they were ashamed : and , behold , he opened not the doors of the parlour ; therefore they took a key , and opened them : and , behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
and it came to pass , when he was come , that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim , and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount , and he before them .
now Heber the Kenite , which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses , had severed himself from the Kenites , and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim , which is by Kedesh .
and Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon .
and the Lord discomfited Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his host , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
but Barak pursued after the chariots , and after the host , unto Harosheth of the Gentiles : and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword ; and there was not a man left .
Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite : for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
and Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said unto him , Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; fear not . and when he had turned in unto her into the tent , she covered him with a mantle .
again he said unto her , Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man doth come and inquire of thee , and say , Is there any man here ? that thou shalt say , No .
and , behold , as Barak pursued Sisera , Jael came out to meet him , and said unto him , Come , and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest . and when he came into her tent , behold , Sisera lay dead , and the nail was in his temples .
and the hand of the children of Israel prospered , and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water , there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord , even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel : then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates .
out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek ; after thee , Benjamin , among THY people ; out of Machir came down governors , and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
she put her hand to the nail , and her right hand to the workmen 's hammer ; and with the hammer she smote Sisera , she smote off his head , when she had pierced and stricken through his temples .
and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel : and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and caves , and strong holds .
and so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
for they came up with their cattle and their tents , and they came as grasshoppers for multitude ; for both they and their camels were without number : and they entered into the land to destroy it .
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all that oppressed you , and drave them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and there came an angel of the Lord , and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained unto Joash the Abi @-@ ezrite : and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
and Gideon went in , and made ready a kid , and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour : the flesh he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out unto him under the oak , and presented it .
and build an altar unto the Lord THY God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
then Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as the Lord had said unto him : and so it was , because he feared his father 's household , and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
and when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was cast down , and the grove was cut down that was by it , and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built .
behold , I will put a Fleece of wool in the floor ; and if the dew be on the Fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said .
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pitched beside the well of Harod : so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
so he brought down the people unto the water : and the Lord said unto Gideon , Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue , as a dog lappeth , him shalt thou set by himself ; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink .
and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host . then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
and it was so , when Gideon heard the telling of the dream , and the interpretation thereof , that he worshipped , and returned into the host of Israel , and said , arise ; for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian .
and the three hundred blew the trumpets , and the Lord set every man 's sword against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to Beth @-@ shittah in Zererath , and to the border of Abel @-@ meholah , unto Tabbath .
and the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after the Midianites .
now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword .
thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon .
and it came to pass , as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and went a whoring after Baalim , and made Baal @-@ berith their god .
and the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side :
and Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother 's brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , He is our brother .
and he went unto his father 's house at Ophrah , and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal , being threescore and ten persons , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
and when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said unto them , Hearken unto me , ye men of Shechem , that God may hearken unto you .
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sincerely , in that ye have made Abimelech king , and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands ;
and ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , threescore and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his maidservant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ; )
and the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains , and they robbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
and they went out into the fields , and gathered their vineyards , and trode the grapes , and made merry , and went into the house of their god , and did eat and drink , and Cursed Abimelech .
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , thou shalt rise early , and set upon the city : and , behold , when he and the people that is with him come out against thee , then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion .
and Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people that were with him , from lying in wait .
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , behold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smote them .
and Abimelech , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and slew them .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and thither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and gat them up to the top of the tower .
and Abimelech came unto the tower , and fought against it , and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord , and served Baalim , and Ashtaroth , and the gods of Syria , and the gods of Zidon , and the gods of Moab , and the gods of the children of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines , and forsook the Lord , and served not him .
and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines , and into the hands of the children of Ammon .
then Jephthah fled from his brethren , and dwelt in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah , and went out with him .
and it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob :
while Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns , and in Aroer and her towns , and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon , three hundred years ? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time ?
then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead , and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon .
then it shall be , that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , shall surely be the Lord 's , and I will offer it up for a burnt offering .
and the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together , and went northward , and said unto Jephthah , Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon , and didst not call us to go with thee ? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire .
and when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and the Lord delivered them into my hand : wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day , to fight against me ?
for , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no rasor shall come on his head : for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines .
then the woman came and told her husband , saying , A man of God came unto me , and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God , very terrible : but I asked him not whence he was , neither told he me his name :
and the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah , Though thou detain me , I will not eat of THY bread : and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the Lord . for Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord .
for it came to pass , when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar , that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar . and Manoah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a kid , and he had nothing in his hand : but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
and when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines , and burnt up both the shocks , and also the standing corn , with the vineyards and olives .
and they said unto him , We are come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines . and Samson said unto them , swear unto me , that ye will not fall upon me yourselves .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand , and called that place Ramath @-@ lehi .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his soul was vexed unto death ;
and when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , which slew many of us .
and it came to pass , when their hearts were merry , that they said , Call for Samson , that he may make us sport . and they called for Samson out of the prison house ; and he made them sport : and they set him between the pillars .
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women , that beheld while Samson made sport .
and Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood , and on which it was borne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
yet he restored the money unto his mother ; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made thereof a Graven image and a molten image : and they were in the house of Micah .
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in ; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel .
and they said , arise , that we may go up against them : for we have seen the land , and , behold , it is very good : and are ye still ? be not slothful to go , and to enter to possess the land .
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war , which were of the children of Dan , stood by the entering of the gate .
and when they were a good way from the house of Micah , the men that were in the houses near to Micah 's house were gathered together , and overtook the children of Dan .
and they took the things which Micah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto Laish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the city with fire .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel : howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first .
and the children of Dan set up the Graven image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Manasseh , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
and it came to pass in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim , who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah .
and it came to pass on the fourth day , when they arose early in the morning , that he rose up to depart : and the damsel 's father said unto his son in law , Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go your way .
and they sat down , and did eat and drink both of them together : for the damsel 's father had said unto the man , Be content , I pray thee , and tarry all night , and let thine heart be merry .
but the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , his concubine also was with him .
and when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said unto his master , Come , I pray thee , and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it .
and they turned aside thither , to go in and to lodge in Gibeah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging .
and , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount Ephraim ; and he sojourned in Gibeah : but the men of the place were Benjamites .
yet there is both straw and provender for our asses ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for THY handmaid , and for the young man which is with THY servants : there is no want of any thing .
and her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way : and , behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
and when he was come into his house , he took a knife , and laid hold on his concubine , and divided her , together with her bones , into twelve pieces , and sent her into all the coasts of Israel .
and the men of Gibeah rose against me , and beset the house round about upon me by night , and thought to have slain me : and my concubine have they forced , that she is dead .
now therefore deliver us the men , the children of Belial , which are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel . but the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel :
but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
and the children of Israel arose , and went up to the house of God , and asked counsel of God , and said , Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin ? and the Lord said , Judah shall go up first .
and the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came unto the house of God , and wept , and sat there before the Lord , and fasted that day until even , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites , because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah .
and the liers in wait hasted , and rushed upon Gibeah ; and the liers in wait drew themselves along , and smote all the city with the edge of the sword .
but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them , and , behold , the flame of the city ascended up to heaven .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness ; but the battle overtook them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them .
and the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin , and smote them with the edge of the sword , as well the men of every city , as the beast , and all that came to hand : also they set on fire all the cities that they came to .
and they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh @-@ gilead four hundred young virgins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
then they said , behold , there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel , on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah .
and the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught : and they went and returned unto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and dwelt in them .
and the children of Israel departed thence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance .
then she arose with her daughters in law , that she might return from the country of Moab : for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread .
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah .
turn again , my daughters , go your way ; for I am too old to have an husband . if I should say , I have hope , if I should have an husband also to night , and should also bear sons ;
and she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed .
wash thyself therefore , and anoint thee , and put THY raiment upon thee , and get thee down to the floor : but make not thyself known unto the man , until he shall have done eating and drinking .
and Boaz said unto the elders , and unto all the people , Ye are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech 's , and all that was Chilion 's and Mahlon 's , of the hand of Naomi .
now there was a certain man of Ramathaim @-@ zophim , of mount Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephrathite :
and they rose up in the morning early , and worshipped before the Lord , and returned , and came to their house to Ramah : and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife ; and the Lord remembered her .
Wherefore it came to pass , when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived , that she bare a son , and called his name Samuel , saying , Because I have asked him of the Lord .
but Hannah went not up ; for she said unto her husband , I will not go up until the child be weaned , and then I will bring him , that he may appear before the Lord , and there abide for ever .
and when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bullocks , and one ephah of flour , and a bottle of wine , and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh : and the child was young .
the adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces ; out of heaven shall he Thunder upon them : the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth ; and he shall give strength unto his king , and exalt the Horn of his anointed .
and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself . so they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither .
now Eli was very old , and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel ; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
behold , the days come , that I will cut off thine arm , and the arm of THY father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
and I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever .
and it came to pass at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place , and his eyes began to wax dim , that he could not see ;
so the people sent to Shiloh , that they might bring from thence the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of hosts , which dwelleth between the cherubims : and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there with the Ark of the Covenant of God .
and when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews ? and they understood that the Ark of the Lord was come into the camp .
and when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow , behold , Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the Ark of the Lord . and they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
and it was so , that , after they had carried it about , the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction : and he smote the men of the city , both small and great , and they had emerods in their secret parts .
Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel : peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
and the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth @-@ shemesh , and went along the highway , lowing as they went , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth @-@ shemesh .
and they of Beth @-@ shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley : and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ark , and rejoiced to see it .
and the cart came into the field of Joshua , a Beth @-@ shemite , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they clave the wood of the cart , and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the Lord .
and the Levites took down the Ark of the Lord , and the coffer that was with it , wherein the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth @-@ shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord .
and these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the Lord ; for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Askelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ;
and the men of Kirjath @-@ jearim came , and fetched up the Ark of the Lord , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the Ark of the Lord .
and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines .
and the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh , and pursued the Philistines , and smote them , until they came under Beth @-@ car .
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
and the Lord said unto Samuel , Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day , wherewith they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also unto thee .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots .
and he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your oliveyards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Bechorath , the son of Aphiah , a Benjamite , a mighty man of power .
and he had a son , whose name was Saul , a choice young man , and a goodly : and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he : from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
and when they were come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant that was with him , Come , and let us return ; lest my father leave caring for the asses , and take thought for us .
( Beforetime in Israel , when a man went to inquire of God , thus he spake , Come , and let us go to the seer : for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer . )
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , behold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago , set not THY mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on thee , and on all THY father 's house ?
and Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the parlour , and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden , which were about thirty persons .
and they arose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send thee away . and Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
and it came to pass , when all that knew him beforetime saw that , behold , he prophesied among the prophets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come unto the son of Kish ? is Saul also among the prophets ?
when he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Matri was taken , and Saul the son of Kish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the Lord . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul , and told the tidings in the ears of the people : and all the people lifted up their voices , and wept .
when Jacob was come into Egypt , and your fathers cried unto the Lord , then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron , which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
and when they forgat the Lord their God , he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
and they cried unto the Lord , and said , We have sinned , because we have forsaken the Lord , and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve thee .
but if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fathers .
and the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand chariots , and six thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude : and they came up , and pitched in Michmash , eastward from Beth @-@ aven .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait , ( for the people were distressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in high places , and in pits .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might salute him .
but now THY kingdom shall not continue : the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart , and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people , because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee .
and the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah , unto the land of Shual :
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
now it came to pass upon a day , that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour , Come , and let us go over to the Philistines ' garrison , that is on the other side . but he told not his father .
and Ahiah , the son of Ahitub , I @-@ chabod 's brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the Lord 's priest in Shiloh , wearing an ephod . and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone .
and between the passages , by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines ' garrison , there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side : and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
and that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armourbearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half acre of land , which a yoke of oxen might plow .
and it came to pass , while Saul talked unto the priest , that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased : and Saul said unto the priest , Withdraw thine hand .
and Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves , and they came to the battle : and , behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow , and there was a very great discomfiture .
moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan .
likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
but Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath : wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand , and dipped it in an honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slew them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
so Saul took the kingdom over Israel , and fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines : and whithersoever he turned himself , he vexed them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishui , and Melchi @-@ shua : and the names of his two daughters were these ; the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam , the daughter of Ahimaaz : and the name of the captain of his host was Abner , the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
it repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king : for he is turned back from following me , and hath not performed my commandments . and it grieved Samuel ; and he cried unto the Lord all night .
and when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning , it was told Samuel , saying , Saul came to Carmel , and , behold , he set him up a place , and is gone about , and passed on , and gone down to Gilgal .
and he had an helmet of brass upon his head , and he was armed with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
and the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next unto him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
and as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the armies of the Philistines , and spake according to the same words : and David heard them .
David said moreover , The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . and Saul said unto David , Go , and the Lord be with thee .
and he took his staff in his hand , and chose him five smooth stones out of the Brook , and put them in a shepherd 's bag which he had , even in a scrip ; and his sling was in his hand : and he drew near to the Philistine .
and it came to pass , when the Philistine arose , and came and drew nigh to meet David , that David hasted , and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
and David put his hand in his bag , and took thence a stone , and slang it , and smote the Philistine in his forehead , that the stone sunk into his forehead ; and he fell upon his face to the earth .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine , and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
therefore David ran , and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the sheath thereof , and slew him , and cut off his head therewith . and when the Philistines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul , that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul .
and Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his garments , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his girdle .
then the princes of the Philistines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul ; so that his name was much set by .
and Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
and when the messengers were come in , behold , there was an image in the bed , with a pillow of goats ' hair for his bolster .
therefore thou shalt deal kindly with THY servant ; for thou hast brought THY servant into a Covenant of the Lord with thee : notwithstanding , if there be in me iniquity , slay me thyself ; for why shouldest thou bring me to THY father ?
but also thou shalt not cut off THY kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth .
and when thou hast stayed three days , then thou shalt go down quickly , and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand , and shalt remain by the stone Ezel .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jonathan arose , and Abner sat by Saul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little lad with him .
and as soon as the lad was gone , David arose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times : and they kissed one another , and wept one with another , until David exceeded .
now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before the Lord ; and his name was Doeg , an Edomite , the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul .
and every one that was in distress , and every one that was in debt , and every one that was discontented , gathered themselves unto him ; and he became a captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
when Saul heard that David was discovered , and the men that were with him , ( now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah , having his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him ; )
and Nob , the city of the priests , smote he with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and sucklings , and oxen , and asses , and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
then David and his men , which were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Keilah , and went whithersoever they could go . and it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah ; and he forbare to go forth .
then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah , saying , Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of Jeshimon ?
Saul also and his men went to seek him . and they told David : wherefore he came down into a rock , and abode in the wilderness of Maon . and when Saul heard that , he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon .
and Saul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul ; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them .
and it came to pass , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , behold , David is in the wilderness of En @-@ gedi .
so David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Saul . but Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
and it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul , that Saul said , Is this THY voice , my son David ? and Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me : forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand , thou killedst me not .
swear now therefore unto me by the Lord , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was Shearing his sheep in Carmel .
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful countenance : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
and David sent out ten young men , and David said unto the young men , Get you up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name :
and now I have heard that thou hast shearers : now THY shepherds which were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there ought missing unto them , all the while they were in Carmel .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers , and give it unto men , whom I know not whence they be ?
but the men were very good unto us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we any thing , as long as we were conversant with them , when we were in the fields :
and it was so , as she rode on the ass , that she came down by the covert of the hill , and , behold , David and his men came down against her ; and she met them .
I pray thee , forgive the trespass of thine handmaid : for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fighteth the battles of the Lord , and evil hath not been found in thee all THY days .
yet a man is risen to pursue thee , and to seek THY soul : but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord THY God ; and the souls of thine enemies , them shall he sling out , as out of the middle of a sling .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee , and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel ;
that this shall be no grief unto thee , nor offence of heart unto my lord , either that thou hast shed blood causeless , or that my lord hath avenged himself : but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord , then remember thine handmaid .
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him , and said unto her , Go up in peace to thine house ; see , I have hearkened to THY voice , and have accepted THY person .
and Abigail came to Nabal ; and , behold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king ; and Nabal 's heart was merry within him , for he was very drunken : wherefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and Abigail hasted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
and Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon , by the way . but David abode in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
and David arose , and came to the place where Saul had pitched : and David beheld the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his host : and Saul lay in the trench , and the people pitched round about him .
so David and Abishai came to the people by night : and , behold , Saul lay sleeping within the trench , and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster : but Abner and the people lay round about him .
the Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord 's anointed : but , I pray thee , take thou now the spear that is at his bolster , and the cruse of water , and let us go .
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea , as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains .
and , behold , as THY life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
and David dwelt with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife .
and David smote the land , and left neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the oxen , and the asses , and the camels , and the apparel , and returned , and came to Achish .
and it came to pass in those days , that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . and Achish said unto David , Know thou assuredly , that thou shalt go out with me to battle , thou and THY men .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . and Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
and the woman said unto him , behold , thou knowest what Saul hath done , how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land : wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life , to cause me to die ?
and the Lord hath done to him , as he spake by me : for the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand , and given it to THY neighbour , even to David :
then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth , and was sore afraid , because of the words of Samuel : and there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
and the woman came unto Saul , and saw that he was sore troubled , and said unto him , behold , thine handmaid hath obeyed THY voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have hearkened unto THY words which thou spakest unto me .
now therefore , I pray thee , hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before thee ; and eat , that thou mayest have strength , when thou goest on THY way .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , Saul slew his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with THY master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
and it came to pass , when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had invaded the south , and Ziklag , and smitten Ziklag , and burned it with fire ;
so David and his men came to the city , and , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captives .
then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
and they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he did eat ; and they made him drink water ;
and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs , and two clusters of raisins : and when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him : for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
and David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day : and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men , which rode upon camels , and fled .
for who will hearken unto you in this matter ? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle , so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff : they shall part alike .
and to them which were in Rachal , and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites , and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites ,
all the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth @-@ Shan , and came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
now it came to pass after the death of Saul , when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had abode two days in Ziklag ;
it came even to pass on the third day , that , behold , a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent , and earth upon his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the earth , and did obeisance .
and David said unto him , How went the matter ? I pray thee , tell me . and he answered , That the people are fled from the battle , and many of the people also are fallen and dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also .
and they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household : and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron .
and the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . and they told David , saying , That the men of Jabesh @-@ gilead were they that buried Saul .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh @-@ gilead , and said unto them , blessed be ye of the Lord , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
and Joab the son of Zeruiah , and the servants of David , went out , and met together by the pool of Gibeon : and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : wherefore that place was called Helkath @-@ hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
and Asahel pursued after Abner ; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
and Abner said to him , Turn thee aside to THY right hand or to THY left , and lay thee hold on one of the young men , and take thee his armour . but Asahel would not turn aside from following of him .
and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
and it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul .
now then do it : for the Lord hath spoken of David , saying , By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines , and out of the hand of all their enemies .
and Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
when Joab and all the host that was with him were come , they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he hath sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
and the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish @-@ bosheth , who lay on a bed at noon .
also in time past , when Saul was king over us , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the Lord said to thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be a captain over Israel .
and let it be , when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt bestir thyself : for then shall the Lord go out before thee , to smite the host of the Philistines .
and when they came to Nachon 's threshingfloor , Uzzah put forth his hand to the Ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the oxen shook it .
so David would not remove the Ark of the Lord unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ edom the Gittite .
and as the Ark of the Lord came into the city of David , Michal Saul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord ; and she despised him in her heart .
and they brought in the Ark of the Lord , and set it in his place , in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it : and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
and he dealt among all the people , even among the whole multitude of Israel , as well to the women as men , to every one a cake of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine . so all the people departed every one to his house .
and I will yet be more vile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .
whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of THY sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
and when THY days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with THY fathers , I will set up THY seed after thee , which shall proceed out of THY bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
and this was yet a small thing in THY sight , O Lord God ; but thou hast spoken also of THY servant 's house for a great while to come . and is this the manner of man , O Lord God ?
and he smote Moab , and measured them with a line , casting them down to the ground ; even with two lines measured he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive . and so the Moabites became David 's servants , and brought gifts .
then said Ziba unto the king , According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant , so shall THY servant do . as for Mephibosheth , said the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king 's sons .
and the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate : and the Syrians of Zoba , and of Rehob , and Ish @-@ tob , and Maacah , were by themselves in the field .
when Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians :
and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother , that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon .
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , then fled they also before Abishai , and entered into the city . so Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
and it came to pass in an eveningtide , that David arose from off his bed , and walked upon the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself ; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon .
and when they had told David , saying , Uriah went not down unto his house , David said unto Uriah , Camest thou not from THY journey ? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house ?
and when David had called him , he did eat and drink before him ; and he made him drunk : and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but went not down to his house .
and it came to pass in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Joab , and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
and if so be that the king 's wrath arise , and he say unto thee , Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
and I gave thee THY master 's house , and THY master 's wives into THY bosom , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord , to do evil in his sight ? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and hast taken his wife to be THY wife , and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon .
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house , and I will take THY wives before thine eyes , and give them unto THY neighbour , and he shall lie with THY wives in the sight of this sun .
and the elders of his house arose , and went to him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
and he took their king 's crown from off his head , the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones : and it was set on David 's head . and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
so Amnon lay down , and made himself sick : and when the king was come to see him , Amnon said unto the king , I pray thee , let Tamar my sister come , and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat at her hand .
so Tamar went to her brother Amnon 's house ; and he was laid down . and she took flour , and kneaded it , and made cakes in his sight , and did bake the cakes .
and I , whither shall I cause my shame to go ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel . now therefore , I pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not withhold me from thee .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were virgins apparelled . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
and Tamar put ashes on her head , and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and went on crying .
and the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man gat him up upon his mule , and fled .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom hath slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
but Absalom fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of speaking , that , behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice and wept : and the king also and all his servants wept very sore .
now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and THY handmaid said , I will now speak unto the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid .
then thine handmaid said , The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable : for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad : therefore the Lord THY God will be with thee .
and Joab fell to the ground on his face , and bowed himself , and thanked the king : and Joab said , To day THY servant knoweth that I have found grace in THY sight , my lord , O king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
and when he polled his head , ( for it was at every year 's end that he polled it : because the hair was heavy on him , therefore he polled it : ) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king 's weight .
and it came to pass after forty years , that Absalom said unto the king , I pray thee , let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed unto the Lord , in Hebron .
and all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , six hundred men which came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
and all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Brook Kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
and lo Zadok also , and all the Levites were with him , bearing the Ark of the Covenant of God : and they set down the Ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
and David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet , and wept as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went barefoot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he worshipped God , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head :
and hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king 's house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz Zadok 's son , and Jonathan Abiathar 's son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
and when king David came to Bahurim , behold , thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera : he came forth , and Cursed still as he came .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed , and will make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and I will smite the king only :
for , said Hushai , thou knowest THY father and his men , that they be mighty men , and they be chafed in their minds , as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field : and THY father is a man of war , and will not lodge with the people .
and he also that is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt : for all Israel knoweth that THY father is a mighty man , and they which be with him are valiant men .
so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground : and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
moreover , if he be gotten into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there be not one small stone found there .
and Absalom and all the men of Israel said , The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel . for the Lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel , to the intent that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom .
and when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his ass , and arose , and gat him home to his house , to his city , and put his household in order , and hanged himself , and died , and was buried in the sepulchre of his father .
and Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab : which Amasa was a man 's son , whose name was Ithra an Israelite , that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah Joab 's mother .
and Joab came into the house to the king , and said , Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all THY servants , which this day have saved THY life , and the lives of THY sons and of THY daughters , and the lives of THY wives , and the lives of THY concubines ;
for THY servant doth know that I have sinned : therefore , behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
and Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king , and had neither dressed his feet , nor trimmed his beard , nor washed his clothes , from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace .
and there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men : and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
but the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of the Lord 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
but the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bare unto Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite :
and the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah , in the sepulchre of Kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . and after that God was intreated for the land .
and there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines , where Elhanan the son of Jaare @-@ oregim , a Bethlehemite , slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
and there was yet a battle in Gath , where was a man of great stature , that had on every hand six fingers , and on every foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
the God of my rock ; in him will I trust : he is my shield , and the Horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my saviour ; thou savest me from violence .
in my distress I called upon the Lord , and cried to my God : and he did hear my voice out of his temple , and my cry did enter into his ears .
and the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the rebuking of the Lord , at the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth , I did stamp them as the mire of the street , and did spread them abroad .
Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people , thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen : a people which I knew not shall serve me .
and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies : thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
now these be the last words of David . David the son of Jesse said , and the man who was raised up on high , the anointed of the God of Jacob , and the sweet psalmist of Israel , said ,
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun riseth , even a morning without clouds ; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain .
these be the names of the mighty men whom David had : the Tachmonite that sat in the seat , chief among the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite : he lift up his spear against eight hundred , whom he slew at one time .
and after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite . and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam : and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim .
and the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but poured it out unto the Lord .
and Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spear against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man , of Kabzeel , who had done many acts , he slew two lionlike men of Moab : he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow :
and he slew an Egyptian , a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and slew him with his own spear .
for the king said to Joab the captain of the host , which was with him , Go now through all the tribes of Israel , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , and number ye the people , that I may know the number of the people .
notwithstanding the king 's word prevailed against Joab , and against the captains of the host . and Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
and came to the strong hold of Tyre , and to all the cities of the Hibites , and of the Canaanites : and they went out to the south of Judah , even to Beer @-@ sheba .
and Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
Wherefore his servants said unto him , Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin : and let her stand before the king , and let her cherish him , and let her lie in THY bosom , that my lord the king may get heat .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men which belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the host : but Solomon THY servant hath he not called .
and thou , my lord , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
and they told the king , saying , behold Nathan the prophet . and when he was come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
even as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel , saying , Assuredly Solomon THY son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead ; even so will I certainly do this day .
then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah .
so Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride upon king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
and all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mule :
so Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the Lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord , which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
then tidings came to Joab : for Joab had turned after Adonijah , though he turned not after Absalom . and Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab , and upon the head of his seed for ever : but upon David , and upon his seed , and upon his house , and upon his throne , shall there be peace for ever from the Lord .
for it shall be , that on the day thou goest out , and passest over the Brook Kidron , thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die : THY blood shall be upon thine own head .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath . and they told Shimei , saying , behold , THY servants be in Gath .
so the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; which went out , and fell upon him , that he died . and the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon .
and I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all THY days .
and Solomon awoke ; and , behold , it was a dream . and he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , and offered up burnt offerings , and offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
and it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also : and we were together ; there was no stranger with us in the house , save we two in the house .
and when I rose in the morning to give my child suck , behold , it was dead : but when I had considered it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , which I did bear .
Baana the son of Ahilud ; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth @-@ shean , which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel , from Beth @-@ shean to Abel @-@ meholah , even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam :
the son of Geber , in Ramoth @-@ gilead ; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh , which are in Gilead ; to him also pertained the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars :
Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead , in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river , from Tiphsah even to Azzah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and he spake of trees , from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall : he spake also of beasts , and of fowl , and of creeping things , and of fishes .
beside the chief of Solomon 's officers which were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled over the people that wrought in the work .
and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Zif , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of the Lord .
and the house which king Solomon built for the Lord , the length thereof was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits , and the height thereof thirty cubits .
and the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubits was the length thereof , according to the breadth of the house ; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house .
and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temple and of the oracle : and he made chambers round about :
the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about , that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither : so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
concerning this house which thou art in building , if thou wilt walk in my statutes , and execute my judgments , and keep all my commandments to walk in them ; then will I perform my word with thee , which I spake unto David THY father :
and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar , both the floor of the house , and the walls of the cieling : and he covered them on the inside with wood , and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir .
and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in the height thereof : and he overlaid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of cedar .
and the whole house he overlaid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold .
and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
and he set the cherubims within the inner house : and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall ; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house .
the two doors also were of olive tree ; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , and overlaid them with gold , and spread gold upon the cherubims , and upon the palm trees .
and in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
and he made a porch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits : and the porch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
and he made two chapiters of molten brass , to set upon the tops of the pillars : the height of the one chapiter was five cubits , and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits :
and nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ; seven for the one chapiter , and seven for the other chapiter .
and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above , over against the belly which was by the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter .
and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called the name thereof Jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and he called the name thereof Boaz .
and he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cubits : and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
it stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubims : and upon the ledges there was a base above : and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work .
and under the borders were four wheels ; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base : and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit .
and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their axletrees , and their naves , and their felloes , and their spokes , were all molten .
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
for on the plates of the ledges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he graved cherubims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
the two pillars , and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars ; and the two networks , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ;
and the bowls , and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , to wit , of the temple .
so was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord . and Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated ; even the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel , unto king Solomon in Jerusalem , that they might bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Zion .
and they brought up the Ark of the Lord , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , even those did the priests and the Levites bring up .
and king Solomon , and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled unto him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and oxen , that could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims .
and they drew out the staves , that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day .
there was nothing in the Ark save the two tables of stone , which Moses put there at Horeb , when the Lord made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
and it came to pass , when the priests were come out of the holy place , that the cloud filled the house of the Lord ,
and the Lord hath performed his word that he spake , and I am risen up in the room of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
and I have set there a place for the Ark , wherein is the Covenant of the Lord , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
who hast kept with THY servant David my father that thou promisedst him : thou spakest also with THY mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of THY servant , and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer , which THY servant prayeth before thee to day :
that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which thou hast said , My name shall be there : that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which THY servant shall make toward this place .
and hearken thou to the supplication of THY servant , and of THY people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : and hear thou in heaven THY dwelling place : and when thou hearest , forgive .
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge THY servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of THY servants , and of THY people Israel , that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon THY land , which thou hast given to THY people for an inheritance .
what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man , or by all THY people Israel , which shall know every man the plague of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear thou in heaven THY dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou , even thou only , knowest the hearts of all the children of men ; )
( for they shall hear of THY great name , and of THY strong hand , and of THY stretched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
if THY people go out to battle against their enemy , whithersoever thou shalt send them , and shall pray unto the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house that I have built for THY name :
if they sin against thee , ( for there is no man that sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy , far or near ;
yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives , and repent , and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives , saying , We have sinned , and have done perversely , we have committed wickedness ;
and so return unto thee with all their heart , and with all their soul , in the land of their enemies , which led them away captive , and pray unto thee toward their land , which thou gavest unto their fathers , the city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I have built for THY name :
and forgive THY people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee , and give them compassion before them who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them :
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of THY servant , and unto the supplication of THY people Israel , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee .
and it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord , he arose from before the altar of the Lord , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven .
blessed be the Lord , that hath given rest unto his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant .
that he may incline our hearts unto him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his judgments , which he commanded our fathers .
and let these my words , wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord , be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night , that he maintain the cause of his servant , and the cause of his people Israel at all times , as the matter shall require :
and it came to pass , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
and if thou wilt walk before me , as David THY father walked , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do according to all that I have commanded thee , and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments :
then I will establish the throne of THY kingdom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David THY father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel .
but if ye shall at all turn from following me , ye or your children , and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you , but go and serve other gods , and worship them :
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have hallowed for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people :
and at this house , which is high , every one that passeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land , and to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ,
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
for Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the cities of store that Solomon had , and cities for his chariots , and cities for his horsemen , and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy , upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day .
these were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon 's work , five hundred and fifty , which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work .
and king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion @-@ geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red sea , in the land of Edom .
and she came to Jerusalem with a very great train , with camels that bare spices , and very much gold , and precious stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she communed with him of all that was in her heart .
beside that he had of the merchantmen , and of the traffick of the spice merchants , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the governors of the country .
and all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold ; none were of silver : it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
and a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , did they bring them out by their means .
for it came to pass , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as was the heart of David his father .
then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh , the abomination of Moab , in the hill that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech , the abomination of the children of Ammon .
Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon , Forasmuch as this is done of thee , and thou hast not kept my Covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded thee , I will surely rend the kingdom from thee , and will give it to THY servant .
for it came to pass , when David was in Edom , and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain , after he had smitten every male in Edom ;
that Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt ; Hadad being yet a little child .
and they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran : and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , unto Pharaoh king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him victuals , and gave him land .
and when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the host was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
and it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; and he had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field :
and the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
and it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt ; )
and they spake unto him , saying , If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day , and wilt serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be THY servants for ever .
but he forsook the counsel of the old men , which they had given him , and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him , saying , Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee , saying , Thy father made our yoke heavy , but make thou it lighter unto us ; thus shalt thou say unto them , My little finger shall be thicker than my father 's loins .
Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people ; for the cause was from the Lord , that he might perform his saying , which the Lord spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the tribute ; and all Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
and it came to pass , when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again , that they sent and called him unto the Congregation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none that followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only .
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem , then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord , even unto Rehoboam king of Judah , and they shall kill me , and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah .
the altar also was rent , and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
and it came to pass , as they sat at the table , that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back :
and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah , saying , Thus saith the Lord , Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord , and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord THY God commanded thee ,
but camest back , and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place , of the which the Lord did say to thee , eat no bread , and drink no water ; THY carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of THY fathers .
and it came to pass , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled for him the ass , to wit , for the prophet whom he had brought back .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcase was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the carcase .
and , behold , men passed by , and saw the carcase cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcase : and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old prophet came to the city , to mourn and to bury him .
and it came to pass , after he had buried him , that he spake to his sons , saying , When I am dead , then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried ; lay my bones beside his bones :
for the saying which he cried by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria , shall surely come to pass .
and Jeroboam 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . but Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
and rent the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it thee : and yet thou hast not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ;
but hast done evil above all that were before thee : for thou hast gone and made thee other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and hast cast me behind THY back :
him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat : for the Lord hath spoken it .
and the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
and Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed , above all that their fathers had done .
and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
and king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields , and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
now the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? and there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the Lord , silver , and gold , and vessels .
so Ben @-@ hadad hearkened unto king ASA , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abel @-@ Beth @-@ maachah , and all Cinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
then king ASA made a proclamation throughout all Judah ; none was exempted : and they took away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha had builded ; and king ASA built with them Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
and Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon .
because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger .
now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust , and made thee prince over my people Israel ; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam , and hast made my people Israel to sin , to provoke me to anger with their sins ;
behold , I will take away the posterity of Baasha , and the posterity of his house ; and will make THY house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat .
now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and it came to pass , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he slew all the house of Baasha : he left him not one that pisseth against a wall , neither of his kinsfolks , nor of his friends .
now the rest of the acts of Elah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and the people that were encamped heard say , Zimri hath conspired , and hath also slain the king : wherefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
and it came to pass , when Zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king 's house , and burnt the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the Lord , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his treason that he wrought , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
for he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin , to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he shewed , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and in the thirty and eighth year of ASA king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel : and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years .
and it came to pass , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians , and went and served Baal , and worshipped him .
for thus saith the Lord God of Israel , The barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oil fail , until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth .
and the barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cruse of oil fail , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by Elijah .
and it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so sore , that there was no breath left in him .
and he said unto her , Give me THY son . and he took him out of her bosom , and carried him up into a loft , where he abode , and laid him upon his own bed .
and Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him unto his mother : and Elijah said , See , THY son liveth .
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord , that Obadiah took an hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord , how I hid an hundred men of the Lord 's prophets by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water ?
and it came to pass , when midday was past , and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded .
and he put the wood in order , and cut the bullock in pieces , and laid him on the wood , and said , fill four barrels with water , and pour it on the burnt sacrifice , and on the wood .
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put his face between his knees ,
and when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Beer @-@ sheba , which belongeth to Judah , and left his servant there .
and he looked , and , behold , there was a cake baken on the coals , and a cruse of water at his head . and he did eat and drink , and laid him down again .
and he came thither unto a cave , and lodged there ; and , behold , the word of the Lord came to him , and he said unto him , What doest thou here , Elijah ?
and it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entering in of the cave . and , behold , there came a voice unto him , and said , What doest thou here , Elijah ?
and it shall come to pass , that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay : and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay .
and Ben @-@ hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together : and there were thirty and two kings with him , and horses , and chariots : and he went up and besieged Samaria , and warred against it .
yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time , and they shall search thine house , and the houses of THY servants ; and it shall be , that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away .
and it came to pass at the return of the year , that Ben @-@ hadad numbered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
and they pitched one over against the other seven days . and so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined : and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day .
but the rest fled to Aphek , into the city ; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left . and Ben @-@ hadad fled , and came into the city , into an inner chamber .
so she wrote letters in Ahab 's name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city , dwelling with Naboth .
and set two men , sons of Belial , before him , to bear witness against him , saying , Thou didst blaspheme God and the king . and then carry him out , and stone him , that he may die .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as Jezebel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
behold , I will bring evil upon thee , and will take away THY posterity , and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel ,
and will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , surely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and Jehoshaphat cried out .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot , Turn thine hand , and carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood ; and they washed his armour ; according unto the word of the Lord which he spake .
now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the Ivory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
and he walked in all the ways of ASA his father ; he turned not aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord : nevertheless the high places were not taken away ; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he shewed , and how he warred , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin :
but the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite , arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria , and say unto them , Is it not because there is not a God in Israel , that ye go to inquire of Baal @-@ zebub the god of Ekron ?
then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty . and he went up to him : and , behold , he sat on the top of an hill . and he spake unto him , Thou man of God , the king hath said , Come down .
and he said , Thou hast asked a hard thing : nevertheless , if thou see me when I am taken from thee , it shall be so unto thee ; but if not , it shall not be so .
and it came to pass , as they still went on , and talked , that , behold , there appeared a chariot of fire , and horses of fire , and parted them both asunder ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
and Elisha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and smote the waters , and said , Where is the Lord God of Elijah ? and when he also had smitten the waters , they parted hither and thither : and Elisha went over .
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him , they said , The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha . and they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
and he went up from thence unto Bethel : and as he was going up by the way , there came forth little children out of the city , and mocked him , and said unto him , Go up , thou bald head ; go up , thou bald head .
and he turned back , and looked on them , and Cursed them in the name of the Lord . and there came forth two she bears out of the wood , and tare forty and two children of them .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom : and they fetched a compass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the cattle that followed them .
for thus saith the Lord , Ye shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your cattle , and your beasts .
and it came to pass in the morning , when the meat offering was offered , that , behold , there came water by the way of Edom , and the country was filled with water .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone upon the water , and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
and when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites , so that they fled before them : but they went forward smiting the Moabites , even in their country .
and when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords , to break through even unto the king of Edom : but they could not .
then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead , and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall . and there was great indignation against Israel : and they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
and she called unto her husband , and said , Send me , I pray thee , one of the young men , and one of the asses , that I may run to the man of God , and come again .
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stretched himself upon the child ; and the flesh of the child waxed warm .
and Elisha came again to Gilgal : and there was a dearth in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him : and he said unto his servant , Set on the great pot , and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets .
so they poured out for the men to eat . and it came to pass , as they were eating of the pottage , that they cried out , and said , O thou man of God , there is death in the pot . and they could not eat thereof .
now Naaman , captain of the host of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honourable , because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria : he was also a mighty man in valour , but he was a leper .
and one went in , and told his lord , saying , Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel .
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come unto thee , behold , I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee , that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy .
and it was so , when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , Wherefore hast thou rent THY clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
and when he came to the tower , he took them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they departed .
therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said unto them , Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
and it came to pass , when they were come into Samaria , that Elisha said , Lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . and the Lord opened their eyes , and they saw ; and , behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
and there was a great famine in Samaria : and , behold , they besieged it , until an ass 's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a cab of dove 's Dung for five pieces of silver .
and it came to pass , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he rent his clothes ; and he passed by upon the wall , and the people looked , and , behold , he had sackcloth within upon his flesh .
and they rose up in the twilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
and they went after them unto Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . and the messengers returned , and told the king .
and the woman arose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years .
and it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines : and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that he took a thick cloth , and dipped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died : and Hazael reigned in his stead .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab : for the daughter of Ahab was his wife : and he did evil in the sight of the Lord .
and the rest of the acts of Joram , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Athaliah , the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did evil in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of Ahab : for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab .
and when thou comest thither , look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brethren , and carry him to an inner chamber ;
and he arose , and went into the house ; and he poured the oil on his head , and said unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , I have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord , even over Israel .
and thou shalt smite the house of Ahab THY master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of Jezebel .
for the whole house of Ahab shall perish : and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel :
and it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and slew seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent him them to Jezreel .
and it came to pass in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , Ye be righteous : behold , I conspired against my master , and slew him : but who slew all these ?
and when he came to Samaria , he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the Lord , which he spake to Elijah .
and Jehu sent through all Israel : and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that came not . and they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another .
Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , Jehu departed not from after them , to wit , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
but Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart : for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam , which made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Jehu , and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he commanded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and a third part shall be at the gate of Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
and ye shall compass the king around about , every man with his weapons in his hand : and he that cometh within the ranges , let him be slain : and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in .
and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded : and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that should go out on the sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
but Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds , the officers of the host , and said unto them , Have her forth without the ranges : and him that followeth her kill with the sword . for the priest had said , Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord .
and they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king 's house : and there was she slain .
and all the people of the land went into the house of Baal , and brake it down ; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . and the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord .
and he took the rulers over hundreds , and the captains , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . and he sat on the throne of the kings .
but it was so , that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
and it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king 's scribe and the high priest came up , and they put up in bags , and told the money that was found in the house of the Lord .
and they gave the money , being told , into the hands of them that did the work , that had the oversight of the house of the Lord : and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders , that wrought upon the house of the Lord ,
and to masons , and hewers of stone , and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
Howbeit there were not made for the house of the Lord bowls of silver , snuffers , basons , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord :
and the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @-@ hadad the son of Hazael , all their days .
( and the Lord gave Israel a saviour , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents , as beforetime .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord ; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel sin : but he walked therein .
and the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died . and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him , and wept over his face , and said , O my father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof .
and it came to pass , as they were burying a man , that , behold , they spied a band of men ; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha : and when the man was let down , and touched the bones of Elisha , he revived , and stood up on his feet .
and it came to pass , as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand , that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father .
and Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth @-@ shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , and all that he did , and his might , how he warred , and how he recovered Damascus , and Hamath , which belonged to Judah , for Israel , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and the Lord smote the king , so that he was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house . and Jotham the king 's son was over the house , judging the people of the land .
and the rest of the acts of Azariah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
for Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah , and came to Samaria , and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria , and slew him , and reigned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of Shallum , and his conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of Menahem , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of Pekahiah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
in the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath @-@ pileser king of Assyria , and took Ijon , and Abel @-@ Beth @-@ maachah , and Jonoah , and Kedesh , and Hazor , and Gilead , and Galilee , all the land of Naphtali , and carried them captive to Assyria .
and Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and smote him , and slew him , and reigned in his stead , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
and the rest of the acts of Pekah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yea , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
so Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath @-@ pileser king of Assyria , saying , I am THY servant and THY son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
and Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
and the king of Assyria hearkened unto him : for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried the people of it captive to Kir , and slew Rezin .
and when the king was come from Damascus , the king saw the altar : and the king approached to the altar , and offered thereon .
and he brought also the brasen altar , which was before the Lord , from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the altar .
and king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the laver from off them ; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it , and put it upon a pavement of stones .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and walked in the statutes of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
and the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the Lord their God , and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city .
notwithstanding they would not hear , but hardened their necks , like to the neck of their fathers , that did not believe in the Lord their God .
therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
and the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon , and from Cuthah , and from Ava , and from Hamath , and from Sepharvaim , and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel : and they possessed Samaria , and dwelt in the cities thereof .
and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they feared not the Lord : therefore the Lord sent lions among them , which slew some of them .
but the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
and the statutes , and the ordinances , and the law , and the commandment , which he wrote for you , ye shall observe to do for evermore ; and ye shall not fear other gods .
now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Abi , the daughter of Zachariah .
he removed the high places , and brake the images , and cut down the groves , and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made : for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it : and he called it Nehushtan .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
and the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria , and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes :
at that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
and the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab @-@ shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem . and they went up and came to Jerusalem . and when they were come up , they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool , which is in the highway of the fuller 's field .
now , behold , thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised Reed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and Pierce it : so is Pharoah king of Egypt unto all that trust on him .
now therefore , I pray thee , give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria , and I will deliver thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on THY part to set riders upon them .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put THY trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rab @-@ shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spake , saying , Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria :
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of Rab @-@ shakeh .
and it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eliakim , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not THY God in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed ; as Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar ?
and Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
and Hezekiah prayed before the Lord , and said , O Lord God of Israel , which dwellest between the cherubims , thou art the God , even thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth : thou hast made heaven and earth .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O Lord our God , I beseech thee , save thou us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God , even thou only .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted THY voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
because THY rage against me and THY tumult is come up into mine ears , therefore I will put my hook in THY nose , and my bridle in THY lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
and it came to pass that night , that the angel of the Lord went out , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
and it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword : and they escaped into the land of Armenia . and Esar @-@ haddon his son reigned in his stead .
and it came to pass , afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court , that the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
and I will add unto THY days fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which THY fathers have laid up in store unto this day , shall be carried into Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the Lord .
and of THY sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
and the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and all his might , and how he made a pool , and a conduit , and brought water into the city , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , after the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars for Baal , and made a grove , as did Ahab king of Israel ; and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchantments , and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards : he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger .
and I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which was evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even unto this day .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and Manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza : and Amon his son reigned in his stead .
Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth , the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jedidah , the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of the Lord , saying ,
go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people :
and Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . and Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
and Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work , that have the oversight of the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he rent his clothes .
and the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Michaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asahiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
so Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asahiah , went unto Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college ; ) and they communed with her .
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read :
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place , and shall not be quenched .
but to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , As touching the words which thou hast heard ;
behold therefore , I will gather thee unto THY fathers , and thou shalt be gathered into THY grave in peace ; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place . and they brought the king word again .
and he brought out the grove from the house of the Lord , without Jerusalem , unto the Brook Kidron , and burned it at the Brook Kidron , and stamped it small to powder , and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people .
and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz , which the kings of Judah had made , and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , did the king beat down , and brake them down from thence , and cast the dust of them into the Brook Kidron .
and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria , which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger , Josiah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel .
and like unto him was there no king before him , that turned to the Lord with all his heart , and with all his soul , and with all his might , according to all the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him .
notwithstanding the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath , wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo , and brought him to Jerusalem , and buried him in his own sepulchre . and the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and anointed him , and made him king in his father 's stead .
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and Pharaoh @-@ nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father , and turned his name to Jehoiakim , and took Jehoahaz away : and he came to Egypt , and died there .
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Zebudah , the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
and the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldees , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by his servants the prophets .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord , as the Lord had said .
Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he , and all his host , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
and they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him with fetters of brass , and carried him to Babylon .
and in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , came Nebuzar @-@ adan , captain of the guard , a servant of the king of Babylon , unto Jerusalem :
and he burnt the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all the houses of Jerusalem , and every great man 's house burnt he with fire .
now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon , with the remnant of the multitude , did Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carry away .
and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord , did the Chaldees break in pieces , and carried the brass of them to Babylon .
and the firepans , and the bowls , and such things as were of gold , in gold , and of silver , in silver , the captain of the guard took away .
and as for the people that remained in the land of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , ruler .
and when all the captains of the armies , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor , there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethahiah , and Johanan the son of Careah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
but it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smote Gedaliah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah .
and all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the armies , arose , and came to Egypt : for they were afraid of the Chaldees .
and his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king , a daily rate for every day , all the days of his life .
and Canaan begat Zidon his firstborn , and Heth ,
and Joktan begat Almodad , and Sheleph , and Hazarmaveth , and Jerah ,
now the sons of Keturah , Abraham 's concubine : she bare Zimran , and Jokshan , and Medan , and Midian , and Ishbak , and Shuah . and the sons of Jokshan ; Sheba , and Dedan .
now these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel ; Bela the son of Beor : and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
and when Husham was dead , Hadad the son of Bedad , which smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
and when Baal @-@ hanan was dead , Hadad reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pai ; and his wife 's name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
now the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were , Mesha his firstborn , which was the father of Ziph ; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron .
now these were the sons of David , which were born unto him in Hebron ; the firstborn Amnon , of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess ; the second Daniel , of Abigail the Carmelitess :
the sons of Shelah the son of Judah were , ER the father of Lecah , and Laadah the father of Mareshah , and the families of the house of them that wrought fine linen , of the house of Ashbea ,
and some of them , even of the sons of Simeon , five hundred men , went to mount Seir , having for their captains Pelatiah , and Neariah , and Rephaiah , and Uzziel , the sons of Ishi .
these are the children of Abihail the son of Huri , the son of Jaroah , the son of Gilead , the son of Michael , the son of Jeshishai , the son of Jahdo , the son of Buz ;
the sons of Reuben , and the Gadites , and half the tribe of Manasseh , of valiant men , men able to bear buckler and sword , and to shoot with bow , and skilful in war , were four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore , that went out to the war .
and these were the heads of the house of their fathers , even Epher , and Ishi , and Eliel , and Azriel , and Jeremiah , and Hodaviah , and Jahdiel , mighty men of valour , famous men , and heads of the house of their fathers .
and they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle of the Congregation with singing , until Solomon had built the house of the Lord in Jerusalem : and then they waited on their office according to their order .
now these are their dwelling places throughout their castles in their coasts , of the sons of Aaron , of the families of the Kohathites : for theirs was the lot .
and unto the sons of Kohath , which were left of the family of that tribe , were cities given out of the half tribe , namely , out of the half tribe of Manasseh , by lot , ten cities .
and to the sons of Gershom throughout their families out of the tribe of Issachar , and out of the tribe of Asher , and out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan , thirteen cities .
unto the sons of Merari were given by lot , throughout their families , out of the tribe of Reuben , and out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun , twelve cities .
and they gave by lot out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , and out of the tribe of the children of Benjamin , these cities , which are called by their names .
and on the other side Jordan by Jericho , on the east side of Jordan , were given them out of the tribe of Reuben , Bezer in the wilderness with her suburbs , and Jahzah with her suburbs ,
and the sons of Bela ; Ezbon , and Uzzi , and Uzziel , and Jerimoth , and IRI , five ; heads of the house of their fathers , mighty men of valour ; and were reckoned by their genealogies twenty and two thousand and thirty and four .
and the number of them , after their genealogy by their generations , heads of the house of the fathers , mighty men of valour , was twenty thousand and two hundred .
all these the sons of Jediael , by the heads of their fathers , mighty men of valour , were seventeen thousand and two hundred soldiers , fit to go out for war and battle .
and Rephah was his son , also Resheph , and Telah his son , and Tahan his son ,
and their possessions and habitations were , Bethel and the towns thereof , and eastward Naaran , and westward Gezer , with the towns thereof ; Shechem also and the towns thereof , unto Gaza and the towns thereof :
and by the borders of the children of Manasseh , Beth @-@ shean and her towns , Taanach and her towns , Megiddo and her towns , Dor and her towns . in these dwelt the children of Joseph the son of Israel .
all these were the children of Asher , heads of their father 's house , choice and mighty men of valour , chief of the princes . and the number throughout the genealogy of them that were apt to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men .
Uthai the son of Ammihud , the son of Omri , the son of Imri , the son of Bani , of the children of Pharez the son of Judah .
and Ibneiah the son of Jeroham , and Elah the son of Uzzi , the son of Michri , and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah , the son of Reuel , the son of Ibnijah ;
and their brethren , according to their generations , nine hundred and fifty and six . all these men were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers .
and Azariah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , the ruler of the house of God ;
and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pashur , the son of Malchijah , and Maasiai the son of Adiel , the son of Jahzerah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Meshillemith , the son of Immer ;
and their brethren , heads of the house of their fathers , a thousand and seven hundred and threescore ; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God .
and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah , the son of Galal , the son of Jeduthun , and Berechiah the son of ASA , the son of Elkanah , that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites .
all these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve . these were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office .
so they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the Lord , namely , the house of the tabernacle , by wards .
some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels , and all the instruments of the sanctuary , and the fine flour , and the wine , and the oil , and the frankincense , and the spices .
and Mattithiah , one of the Levites , who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite , had the set office over the things that were made in the pans .
and the Philistines followed hard after Saul , and after his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchi @-@ shua , the sons of Saul .
and when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , then they forsook their cities , and fled : and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
they arose , all the valiant men , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
and moreover in time past , even when Saul was king , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the Lord THY God said unto thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel .
these also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom , and with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel .
and the three brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to the Lord ,
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done many acts ; he slew two lionlike men of Moab : also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day .
now these are they that came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish : and they were among the mighty men , helpers of the war .
these are they that went over Jordan in the first month , when it had overflown all his banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to David to Hebron , to turn the kingdom of Saul to him , according to the word of the Lord .
and of the children of Issachar , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their brethren were at their commandment .
and on the other side of Jordan , of the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and of the half tribe of Manasseh , with all manner of instruments of war for the battle , an hundred and twenty thousand .
so David brought not the Ark home to himself to the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ edom the Gittite .
and it shall be , when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt go out to battle : for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines .
and said unto them , Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites : sanctify yourselves , both ye and your brethren , that ye may bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it .
and David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick , psalteries and harps and cymbals , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
so the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brethren , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brethren , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
so David , and the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obed @-@ edom with joy .
and David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites that bare the Ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : David also had upon him an ephod of linen .
thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with shouting , and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpets , and with cymbals , making a noise with psalteries and harps .
and it came to pass , as the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing : and she despised him in her heart .
and he dealt to every one of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine .
so he left there before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord Asaph and his brethren , to minister before the Ark continually , as every day 's work required :
to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord , which he commanded Israel ;
and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
and it shall come to pass , when THY days be expired that thou must go to be with THY fathers , that I will raise up THY seed after thee , which shall be of THY sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes , O God ; for thou hast also spoken of THY servant 's house for a great while to come , and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , O Lord God .
them also king David dedicated unto the Lord , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
and the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will help thee .
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and David took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it ; and it was set upon David 's head : and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city .
and it came to pass after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines ; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai , that was of the children of the giant : and they were subdued .
and yet again there was war at Gath , where was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were four and twenty , six on each hand , and six on each foot : and he also was the son of the giant .
and Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David . and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword : and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword .
then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
and as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshingfloor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
for the tabernacle of the Lord , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of the burnt offering , were at that season in the high place at Gibeon .
but the word of the Lord came to me , saying , Thou hast shed blood abundantly , and hast made great wars : thou shalt not build an house unto my name , because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight .
then shalt thou prosper , if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dread not , nor be dismayed .
now , behold , in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand talents of gold , and a thousand thousand talents of silver ; and of brass and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance : timber also and stone have I prepared ; and thou mayest add thereto .
the sons of Amram ; Aaron and Moses : and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons for ever , to burn incense before the Lord , to minister unto him , and to bless in his name for ever .
these were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers ; even the chief of the fathers , as they were counted by number of names by their polls , that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord , from the age of twenty years and upward .
because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord , in the courts , and in the chambers , and in the purifying of all holy things , and the work of the service of the house of God ;
and there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar ; and thus were they divided . among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers , and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers .
thus were they divided by lot , one sort with another ; for the governors of the sanctuary , and governors of the house of God , were of the sons of Eleazar , and of the sons of Ithamar .
these were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the Lord , according to their manner , under Aaron their father , as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him .
moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph , and of Heman , and of Jeduthun , who should prophesy with harps , with psalteries , and with cymbals : and the number of the workmen according to their service was :
all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the Lord , with cymbals , psalteries , and harps , for the service of the house of God , according to the king 's order to Asaph , Jeduthun , and Heman .
so the number of them , with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the Lord , even all that were cunning , was two hundred fourscore and eight .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons ; Simri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him the chief ; )
which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fathers , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the host , had dedicated .
and all that Samuel the seer , and Saul the son of Kish , and Abner the son of Ner , and Joab the son of Zeruiah , had dedicated ; and whosoever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of Shelomith , and of his brethren .
among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief , even among the Hebronites , according to the generations of his fathers . in the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead .
and over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the storehouses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the castles , was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah :
and of all my sons , ( for the Lord hath given me many sons , ) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch , and of the houses thereof , and of the treasuries thereof , and of the upper chambers thereof , and of the inner parlours thereof , and of the place of the mercy seat ,
and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit , of the courts of the house of the Lord , and of all the chambers round about , of the treasuries of the house of God , and of the treasuries of the dedicated things :
also for the courses of the priests and the Levites , and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord .
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
even the weight for the candlesticks of gold , and for their lamps of gold , by weight for every candlestick , and for the lamps thereof : and for the candlesticks of silver by weight , both for the candlestick , and also for the lamps thereof , according to the use of every candlestick .
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims , that spread out their wings , and covered the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord .
moreover , because I have set my affection to the house of my God , I have of mine own proper good , of gold and silver , which I have given to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house ,
the gold for things of gold , and the silver for things of silver , and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers . and who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord ?
Thine , O Lord , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the majesty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine ; thine is the kingdom , O Lord , and thou art exalted as head above all .
both riches and honour come of thee , and thou reignest over all ; and in thine hand is power and might ; and in thine hand it is to make great , and to give strength unto all .
and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep THY commandments , THY testimonies , and THY statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings unto the Lord , on the morrow after that day , even a thousand bullocks , a thousand rams , and a thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel :
now the acts of David the king , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of Samuel the seer , and in the book of Nathan the prophet , and in the book of Gad the seer ,
then Solomon spake unto all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
so Solomon , and all the Congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of the Congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness .
but the Ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath @-@ jearim to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the brasen altar , that Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , he put before the tabernacle of the Lord : and Solomon and the Congregation sought unto it .
and they fetched up , and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , by their means .
and Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre , saying , As thou didst deal with David my father , and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein , even so deal with me .
and Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel , after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them ; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount Moriah , where the Lord appeared unto David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
and the porch that was in the front of the house , the length of it was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the height was an hundred and twenty : and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the posts , and the walls thereof , and the doors thereof , with gold ; and graved cherubims on the walls .
and the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long : one wing of the one cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was likewise five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
and he made chains , as in the oracle , and put them on the heads of the pillars ; and made an hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
and he reared up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin , and the name of that on the left Boaz .
also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and five cubits the height thereof ; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
and under it was the similitude of oxen , which did compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about . two rows of oxen were cast , when it was cast .
it stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
and the thickness of it was an handbreadth , and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies ; and it received and held three thousand baths .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred basons of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid the doors of them with brass .
to wit , the two pillars , and the pommels , and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars , and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars ;
and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers , of pure gold : and the entry of the house , the inner doors thereof for the most holy place , and the doors of the house of the temple , were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished : and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated ; and the silver , and the gold , and all the instruments , put he among the treasures of the house of God .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel , unto Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Zion .
and they brought up the Ark , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , these did the priests and the Levites bring up .
also king Solomon , and all the Congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the Ark , sacrificed sheep and oxen , which could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place , to the oracle of the house , into the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims :
and they drew out the staves of the Ark , that the ends of the staves were seen from the Ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen without . and there it is unto this day .
and it came to pass , when the priests were come out of the holy place : ( for all the priests that were present were sanctified , and did not then wait by course :
but the Lord said to David my father , Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name , thou didst well in that it was in thine heart :
the Lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken : for I am risen up in the room of David my father , and am set on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
Thou which hast kept with THY servant David my father that which thou hast promised him ; and spakest with THY mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
have respect therefore to the prayer of THY servant , and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which THY servant prayeth before thee :
that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put THY name there ; to hearken unto the prayer which THY servant prayeth toward this place .
Hearken therefore unto the supplications of THY servant , and of THY people Israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear thou from THY dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when thou hearest , forgive .
then hear thou from heaven , and do , and judge THY servants , by requiting the wicked , by recompensing his way upon his own head ; and by justifying the righteous , by giving him according to his righteousness .
when the heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; yet if they pray toward this place , and confess THY name , and turn from their sin , when thou dost afflict them ;
then hear thou from heaven , and forgive the sin of THY servants , and of THY people Israel , when thou hast taught them the good way , wherein they should walk ; and send rain upon THY land , which thou hast given unto THY people for an inheritance .
then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man , or of all THY people Israel , when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief , and shall spread forth his hands in this house :
then hear thou from heaven THY dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men : )
moreover concerning the stranger , which is not of THY people Israel , but is come from a far country for THY great name 's sake , and THY mighty hand , and THY stretched out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ;
if THY people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them , and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I have built for THY name ;
if they sin against thee , ( for there is no man which sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them over before their enemies , and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near ;
yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive , and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity , saying , We have sinned , we have done amiss , and have dealt wickedly ;
if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity , whither they have carried them captives , and pray toward their land , which thou gavest unto their fathers , and toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house which I have built for THY name :
now when Solomon had made an end of praying , the fire came down from heaven , and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices ; and the glory of the Lord filled the house .
and the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord , because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord 's house .
moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord : for there he offered burnt offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings , because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings , and the meat offerings , and the fat .
and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents , glad and merry in heart for the Goodness that the Lord had shewed unto David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the Lord , and in his own house , he prosperously effected .
if my people , which are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
and as for thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as David THY father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statues and my judgments ;
and this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , wherein Solomon had built the house of the Lord , and his own house ,
and Baalath , and all the store cities that Solomon had , and all the chariot cities , and the cities of the horsemen , and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and throughout all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people that were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which were not of Israel ,
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the solemn feasts , three times in the year , even in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles .
Howbeit I believed not their words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the one half of the greatness of THY wisdom was not told me : for thou exceedest the fame that I heard .
and all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
and it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was in Egypt , whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him , and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
and the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him , saying , Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee , saying , Thy father made our yoke heavy , but make thou it somewhat lighter for us ; thus shalt thou say unto them , My little finger shall be thicker than my father 's loins .
so the king hearkened not unto the people : for the cause was of God , that the Lord might perform his word , which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute ; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . but king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
and when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem , he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest 's office unto the Lord :
so they strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong , three years : for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon .
and he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin , unto every fenced city : and he gave them victual in abundance . and he desired many wives .
and it came to pass , when Rehoboam had established the kingdom , and had strengthened himself , he forsook the law of the Lord , and all Israel with him .
so Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard , that kept the entrance of the king 's house .
ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a Covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord .
but as for us , the Lord is our God , and we have not forsaken him ; and the priests , which minister unto the Lord , are the sons of Aaron , and the Levites wait upon their business :
and , behold , God himself is with us for our captain , and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you . O children of Israel , fight ye not against the Lord God of your fathers ; for ye shall not prosper .
then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it came to pass , that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
and ASA and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar : and the Ethiopians were overthrown , that they could not recover themselves ; for they were destroyed before the Lord , and before his host ; and they carried away very much spoil .
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out , nor to him that came in , but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
and all Judah rejoiced at the oath : for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and the Lord gave them rest round about .
and also concerning Maachah the mother of ASA the king , he removed her from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove : and ASA cut down her idol , and stamped it , and burnt it at the Brook Kidron .
and he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of ASA Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah , and built Ramah , to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to ASA king of Judah .
then ASA brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben @-@ hadad king of Syria , that dwelt at Damascus , saying ,
and at that time Hanani the seer came to ASA king of Judah , and said unto him , Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria , and not relied on the Lord THY God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand .
for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth , to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . herein thou hast done foolishly : therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars .
then ASA was wroth with the seer , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . and ASA oppressed some of the people the same time .
and ASA in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord , but to the physicians .
also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes , even to Ben @-@ hail , and to Obadiah , and to Zechariah , and to Nethaneel , and to Michaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah .
and they taught in Judah , and had the book of the law of the Lord with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught the people .
and these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers : of Judah , the captains of thousands ; Adnah the chief , and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand .
and after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria . and Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance , and for the people that he had with him , and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth @-@ gilead .
and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne , clothed in their robes , and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , It is the king of Israel . therefore they compassed about him to fight : but Jehoshaphat cried out , and the Lord helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
for it came to pass , that , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his chariot man , Turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and the battle increased that day : howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died .
moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites , and of the priests , and of the chief of the fathers of Israel , for the judgment of the Lord , and for controversies , when they returned to Jerusalem .
it came to pass after this also , that the children of Moab , and the children of Ammon , and with them other beside the Ammonites , came against Jehoshaphat to battle .
then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph , came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the Congregation ;
to morrow go ye down against them : behold , they come up by the cliff of Ziz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the Brook , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
and the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites , and of the children of the Korhites , stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high .
for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir , utterly to slay and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , every one helped to destroy another .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah ; for there they blessed the Lord : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Berachah , unto this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
and Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani , who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel .
now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father , he strengthened himself , and slew all his brethren with the sword , and divers also of the princes of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of Ahab : for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife : and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord .
Howbeit the Lord would not destroy the house of David , because of the Covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
and there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet , saying , Thus saith the Lord God of David THY father , Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat THY father , nor in the ways of ASA king of Judah ,
and they came up into Judah , and brake into it , and carried away all the substance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wives ; so that there was never a son left him , save Jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
and he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah , when he fought with Hazael king of Syria . and Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel , because he was sick .
and it came to pass , that , when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab , and found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah , that ministered to Ahaziah , he slew them .
and in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into Covenant with him .
and they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the chief of the fathers of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
this is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you entering on the sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be porters of the doors ;
and a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation : and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord .
but let none come into the house of the Lord , save the priests , and they that minister of the Levites ; they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord .
and the Levites shall compass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and whosoever else cometh into the house , he shall be put to death : but be ye with the king when he cometh in , and when he goeth out .
so the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded , and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that were to go out on the sabbath : for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses .
moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king David 's , which were in the house of God .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king 's house , they slew her there .
then all the people went to the house of Baal , and brake it down , and brake his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
and he took the captains of hundreds , and the nobles , and the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of the Lord : and they came through the high gate into the king 's house , and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom .
for the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon Baalim .
and the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord , and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass at the end of the year , that the host of Syria came up against him : and they came to Judah and Jerusalem , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus .
now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father .
then Amaziah separated them , to wit , the army that was come to him out of Ephraim , to go home again : wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in great anger .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
now it came to pass , after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites , that he brought the gods of the children of Seir , and set them up to be his gods , and bowed down himself before them , and burned incense unto them .
Wherefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent unto him a prophet , which said unto him , Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand ?
Thou sayest , Lo , thou hast smitten the Edomites ; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and Judah with thee ?
so Joash the king of Israel went up ; and they saw one another in the face , both he and Amaziah king of Judah , at Beth @-@ shemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
and Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash , the son of Jehoahaz , at Beth @-@ shemesh , and brought him to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
and he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed @-@ edom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the Lord they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish : but they sent to Lachish after him , and slew him there .
and he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and brake down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod , and built cities about Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
and Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
so Uzziah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , He is a leper : and Jotham his son reigned in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord , like David his father :
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
and the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against them that came from the war ,
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the princes , and gave it unto the king of Assyria : but he helped him not .
and Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord , and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
and Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem : but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old , and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the Lord , and repaired them .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
then the Levites arose , Mahath the son of Amasai , and Joel the son of Azariah , of the sons of the Kohathites : and of the sons of Merari , Kish the son of Abdi , and Azariah the son of Jehalelel : and of the Gershonites ; Joah the son of Zimmah , and Eden the son of Joah :
and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord , to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord . and the Levites took it , to carry it out abroad into the Brook Kidron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the Lord : so they sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days ; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end .
then they went in to Hezekiah the king , and said , We have cleansed all the house of the Lord , and the altar of burnt offering , with all the vessels thereof , and the shewbread table , with all the vessels thereof .
so they killed the bullocks , and the priests received the blood , and sprinkled it on the altar : likewise , when they had killed the rams , they sprinkled the blood upon the altar : they killed also the lambs , and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar .
and Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar . and when the burnt offering began , the song of the Lord began also with the trumpets , and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . and they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshipped .
now be ye not stiffnecked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the Lord , and enter into his sanctuary , which he hath sanctified for ever : and serve the Lord your God , that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you .
and they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the Brook Kidron .
then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord .
for there were many in the Congregation that were not sanctified : therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean , to sanctify them unto the Lord .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the Lord .
and all the Congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the Congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings , to wit , for the morning and evening burnt offerings , and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths , and for the new moons , and for the set feasts , as it is written in the law of the Lord .
and concerning the children of Israel and Judah , that dwelt in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep , and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the Lord their God , and laid them by heaps .
and he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and spake comfortably to them , saying ,
after this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem , ( but he himself laid siege against Lachish , and all his power with him , ) unto Hezekiah king of Judah , and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem , saying ,
know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands ? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to affright them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
and Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour : and he made himself treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all manner of pleasant jewels ;
Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his Goodness , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
and Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death . and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead .
but did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , like unto the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom : also he observed times , and used enchantments , and used witchcraft , and dealt with a familiar spirit , and with wizards : he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger .
and he took away the strange gods , and the idol out of the house of the Lord , and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord , and in Jerusalem , and cast them out of the city .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and his prayer unto his God , and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel .
but he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as did Manasseh his father : for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them ;
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land , and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the Lord his God .
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house :
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses .
and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers , and to the hand of the workmen .
and the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
and Hilkiah , and they that the king had appointed , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college : ) and they spake to her to that effect .
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah :
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place , and shall not be quenched .
and as for the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of the Lord , so shall ye say unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard ;
and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the Levites .
and Josiah gave to the people , of the flock , lambs and kids , all for the passover offerings , for all that were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bullocks : these were of the king 's substance .
and they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer unto the Lord , as it is written in the book of Moses . and so did they with the oxen .
and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance : but the other holy offerings sod they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and divided them speedily among all the people .
his servants therefore took him out of that chariot , and put him in the second chariot that he had ; and they brought him to Jerusalem , and he died , and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers . and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
and when the year was expired , king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
and the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers , rising up betimes , and sending ; because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
and all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes ; all these he brought to Babylon .
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled , the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
who is there among you of all his people ? his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem , which is in Judah , and build the house of the Lord God of Israel , ( he is the God , ) which is in Jerusalem .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , beside all that was willingly offered .
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity , of those which had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon , and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah , every one unto his city ;
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all an hundred thirty and nine .
and these were they which went up from Tel @-@ melah , Tel @-@ harsa , Cherub , Addan , and Immer : but they could not shew their father 's house , and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
and of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai ; which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name :
and some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
and they set the altar upon his bases ; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries : and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
and afterward offered the continual burnt offering , both of the new moons , and of all the set feasts of the Lord that were consecrated , and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the Lord .
then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren , Kadmiel and his sons , the sons of Judah , together , to set forward the workmen in the house of God : the sons of Henadad , with their sons and their brethren the Levites .
but many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy :
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people : for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the noise was heard afar off .
and in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and the rest of their companions , unto Artaxerxes king of Persia ; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue , and interpreted in the Syrian tongue .
then wrote Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions ; the Dinaites , the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Susanchites , the Dehavites , and the Elamites ,
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over , and set in the cities of Samaria , and the rest that are on this side the river , and at such a time .
be it known now unto the king , that , if this city be builded , and the walls set up again , then will they not pay toll , tribute , and custom , and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings .
then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor , and to Shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria , and unto the rest beyond the river , Peace , and at such a time .
and I commanded , and search hath been made , and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein .
now when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel , even unto them .
but the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to Darius : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the copy of the letter that Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar @-@ boznai , and his companions the Apharsachites , which were on this side the river , sent unto Darius the king :
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem , and brought them into the temple of Babylon , those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered unto one , whose name was Sheshbazzar , whom he had made governor ;
then came the same Sheshbazzar , and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now hath it been in building , and yet it is not finished .
then Darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the rolls , where the treasures were laid up in Babylon .
and there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of the Medes , a roll , and therein was a record thus written :
and they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
and there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , unto Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest , the scribe , even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the Lord , and of his statutes to Israel .
Artaxerxes , king of kings , unto Ezra the priest , a scribe of the law of the God of heaven , perfect peace , and at such a time .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Levites , in my realm , which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem :
and whatsoever shall seem good to thee , and to THY brethren , to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do after the will of your God .
and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of THY God , which thou shalt have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king 's treasure house .
whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven : for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
also we certify you , that touching any of the priests and Levites , singers , porters , Nethinims , or ministers of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose toll , tribute , or custom , upon them .
and whosoever will not do the law of THY God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed speedily upon him , whether it be unto death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
blessed be the Lord God of our fathers , which hath put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to beautify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem :
and I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava ; and there abode we in tents three days : and I viewed the people , and the priests , and found there none of the sons of Levi .
then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , men of understanding .
and weighed unto them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering of the house of our God , which the king , and his counsellers , and his lords , and all Israel there present , had offered :
watch ye , and keep them , until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites , and chief of the fathers of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the Lord .
so took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands : yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass .
then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of the transgression of those that had been carried away ; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice .
and at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees , and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God .
and Shechaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , answered and said unto Ezra , We have trespassed against our God , and have taken strange wives of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
and that whosoever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the Congregation of those that had been carried away .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren ; Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
that Hanani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
and it came to pass , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days , and fasted , and prayed before the God of heaven ,
but if ye turn unto me , and keep my commandments , and do them ; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven , yet will I gather them from thence , and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there .
and it came to pass in the month Nisan , in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king , that wine was before him : and I took up the wine , and gave it unto the king . now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence .
and said unto the king , Let the king live for ever : why should not my countenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' sepulchres , lieth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ?
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
and I arose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem : neither was there any beast with me , save the beast that I rode upon .
and the rulers knew not whither I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the work .
but when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian , heard it , they laughed us to scorn , and despised us , and said , What is this thing that ye do ? will ye rebel against the king ?
then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests , and they builded the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up the doors of it ; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it , unto the tower of Hananeel .
but the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build , who also laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
and next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah , the son of Koz . and next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabeel . and next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana .
moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah , and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah ; they laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , and the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
and next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite , and Jadon the Meronothite , the men of Gibeon , and of Mizpah , unto the throne of the governor on this side the river .
the valley gate repaired Hanun , and the inhabitants of Zanoah ; they built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof , and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the Dung gate .
but the Dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab , the ruler of part of Beth @-@ haccerem ; he built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
after him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk , the ruler of the half part of Beth @-@ zur , unto the place over against the sepulchres of David , and to the pool that was made , and unto the house of the mighty .
Palal the son of Uzai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which lieth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh .
but it came to pass , that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall , he was wroth , and took great indignation , and mocked the Jews .
and cover not their iniquity , and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee : for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders .
but it came to pass , that when Sanballat , and Tobiah , and the Arabians , and the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites , heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up , and that the breaches began to be stopped , then they were very wroth ,
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
and it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servants wrought in the work , and the other half of them held both the spears , the shields , and the bows , and the habergeons ; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah .
they which builded on the wall , and they that bare burdens , with those that laded , every one with one of his hands wrought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
for the builders , every one had his sword girded by his side , and so builded . and he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
so neither I , nor my brethren , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard which followed me , none of us put off our clothes , saving that every one put them off for washing .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers , beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us .
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem , saying , There is a king in Judah : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together .
therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
these are the children of the province , that went up out of the captivity , of those that had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away , and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah , every one unto his city ;
the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , an hundred thirty and eight .
and of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai , which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife , and was called after their name .
so the priests , and the Levites , and the porters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the Nethinims , and all Israel , dwelt in their cities ; and when the seventh month came , the children of Israel were in their cities .
also Jeshua , and Bani , and Sherebiah , Jamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodijah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Jozabad , Hanan , Pelaiah , and the Levites , caused the people to understand the law : and the people stood in their place .
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people , the priests , and the Levites , unto Ezra the scribe , even to understand the words of the law .
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves booths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of Ephraim .
and all the Congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths , and sat under the booths : for since the days of Jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so . and there was very great gladness .
also day by day , from the first day unto the last day , he read in the book of the law of God . and they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly , according unto the manner .
and they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they confessed , and worshipped the Lord their God .
and shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharoah , and on all his servants , and on all the people of his land : for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them . so didst thou get thee a name , as it is this day .
and thou didst divide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way wherein they should go .
and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger , and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them .
yet thou in THY manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness : the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day , to lead them in the way ; neither the pillar of fire by night , to shew them light , and the way wherein they should go .
moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations , and didst divide them into corners : so they possessed the land of Sihon , and the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven , and broughtest them into the land , concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept THY law , nor hearkened unto THY commandments and THY testimonies , wherewith thou didst testify against them .
for they have not served thee in their kingdom , and in THY great Goodness that thou gavest them , and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them , neither turned they from their wicked works .
behold , we are servants this day , and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof , behold , we are servants in it :
and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins : also they have dominion over our bodies , and over our cattle , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
also the firstborn of our sons , and of our cattle , as it is written in the law , and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks , to bring to the house of our God , unto the priests that minister in the house of our God :
and the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites , when the Levites take tithes : and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God , to the chambers , into the treasure house .
and at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Judah ; Athaiah the son of Uzziah , the son of Zechariah , the son of Amariah , the son of Shephatiah , the son of Mahalaleel , of the children of Perez ;
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch , the son of Col @-@ hozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of Shiloni .
and these are the sons of Benjamin ; Sallu the son of Meshullam , the son of Joed , the son of Pedaiah , the son of Kolaiah , the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ithiel , the son of Jesaiah .
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , was the ruler of the house of God .
and their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two : and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pelaliah , the son of Amzi , the son of Zechariah , the son of Pashur , the son of Malchiah ,
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and Amashai the son of Azareel , the son of Ahasai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
and their brethren , mighty men of valour , an hundred twenty and eight : and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of one of the great men .
and for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjath @-@ arba , and in the villages thereof , and at Dibon , and in the villages thereof , and at Jekabzeel , and in the villages thereof ,
the sons of Levi , the chief of the fathers , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
and the chief of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brethren over against them , to praise and to give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , ward over against ward .
then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the Dung gate :
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets ; namely , Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Michaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph :
and at the fountain gate , which was over against them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the going up of the wall , above the house of David , even unto the water gate eastward .
and from above the gate of Ephraim , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the tower of Hananeel , and the tower of Meah , even unto the sheep gate : and they stood still in the prison gate .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the Congregation of God for ever ;
and I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them : for the Levites and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
there dwelt men of Tyre also therein , which brought fish , and all manner of ware , and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
then I testified against them , and said unto them , Why lodge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath .
and I contended with them , and Cursed them , and smote certain of them , and plucked off their hair , and made them swear by God , saying , Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons , nor take their daughters unto your sons , or for yourselves .
now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus , ( this is Ahasuerus which reigned , from India even unto Ethiopia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces : )
that in those days , when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace , both unto great and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace ;
and the drinking was according to the law ; none did compel : for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleasure .
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she came not .
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great , ) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
then thus came every maiden unto the king ; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king 's house .
and the king loved Esther above all the women , and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he set the royal crown upon her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
in those days , while Mordecai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's chamberlains , Bigthan and Teresh , of those which kept the door , were wroth , and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus .
and when Inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both hanged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bowed , and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
and he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone ; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai : wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even the people of Mordecai .
if it please the king , let it be written that they may be destroyed : and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business , to bring it into the king 's treasuries .
when Mordecai perceived all that was done , Mordecai rent his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and cried with a loud and a bitter cry ;
so Esther 's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her . then was the queen exceedingly grieved ; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him : but he received it not .
then called Esther for Hatach , one of the king 's chamberlains , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a commandment to Mordecai , to know what it was , and why it was .
now it came to pass on the third day , that Esther put on her royal apparel , and stood in the inner court of the king 's house , over against the king 's house : and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house , over against the gate of the house .
and it was so , when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court , that she obtained favour in his sight : and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand . so Esther drew near , and touched the top of the sceptre .
then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of indignation against Mordecai .
and Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
on that night could not the king sleep , and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles ; and they were read before the king .
and the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , What is THY petition , queen Esther ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is THY request ? and it shall be performed , even to the half of the kingdom .
then Esther the queen answered and said , If I have found favour in THY sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
and Esther spake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
and all the rulers of the provinces , and the lieutenants , and the deputies , and officers of the king , helped the Jews ; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them .
and Parshandatha , and Dalphon , and Aspatha ,
for the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and slew three hundred men at Shushan ; but on the prey they laid not their hand .
but the other Jews that were in the king 's provinces gathered themselves together , and stood for their lives , and had rest from their enemies , and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand , but they laid not their hands on the prey ,
therefore the Jews of the villages , that dwelt in the unwalled towns , made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting , and a good day , and of sending portions one to another .
because Haman the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , had devised against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast PUR , that is , the lot , to consume them , and to destroy them ;
but when Esther came before the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he devised against the Jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
and all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai , whereunto the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
his substance also was seven thousand sheep , and three thousand camels , and five hundred yoke of oxen , and five hundred she asses , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east .
and when they lifted up their eyes afar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice , and wept ; and they rent every one his mantle , and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the dawning of the day :
for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come unto me .
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field : and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee .
then should I yet have comfort ; yea , I would harden myself in sorrow : let him not spare ; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One .
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ? for now shall I sleep in the dust ; and thou shalt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
if I be wicked , woe unto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine affliction ;
he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease .
behold , he breaketh down , and it cannot be built again : he shutteth up a man , and there can be no opening .
Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly unto all my paths ; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet .
I was at ease , but he hath broken me asunder : he hath also taken me by my neck , and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
that which he laboured for shall he restore , and shall not swallow it down : according to his substance shall the restitution be , and he shall not rejoice therein .
when he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating .
on the left hand , where he doth work , but I cannot behold him : he hideth himself on the right hand , that I cannot see him :
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terrors of the shadow of death .
then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite , of the kindred of Ram : against Job was his wrath kindled , because he justified himself rather than God .
let me not , I pray you , accept any man 's person , neither let me give flattering titles unto man .
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous : but with kings are they on the throne ; yea , he doth establish them for ever , and they are exalted .
even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place , where there is no straitness ; and that which should be set on THY table should be full of fatness .
and it is turned round about by his counsels : that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth .
and it was so , that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job , the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite , My wrath is kindled against thee , and against THY two friends : for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant Job hath .
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water , that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; his leaf also shall not wither ; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper .
but as for me , I will come into THY house in the multitude of THY mercy : and in THY fear will I worship toward THY holy temple .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou defendest them : let them also that love THY name be joyful in thee .
if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me ; ( yea , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy : )
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den : he lieth in wait to catch the poor : he doth catch the poor , when he draweth him into his net .
Shew THY marvellous lovingkindness , O thou that savest by THY right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them .
the Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my buckler , and the Horn of my salvation , and my high tower .
in my distress I called upon the Lord , and cried unto my God : he heard my voice out of his temple , and my cry came before him , even into his ears .
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people ; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
he delivereth me from mine enemies : yea , thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
his going forth is from the end of the heaven , and his circuit unto the ends of it : and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof .
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon THY strings against the face of them .
I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint : my heart is like wax ; it is melted in the midst of my bowels .
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me : therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy ; I will sing , yea , I will sing praises unto the Lord .
give them according to their deeds , and according to the wickedness of their endeavours : give them after the work of their hands ; render to them their desert .
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
but in mine adversity they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together : yea , the abjects gathered themselves together against me , and I knew it not ; they did tear me , and ceased not :
rest in the Lord , and wait patiently for him : fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way , because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass .
for yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : yea , thou shalt diligently consider his place , and it shall not be .
many , O Lord my God , are THY wonderful works which thou hast done , and THY thoughts which are to us @-@ ward : they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee : if I would declare and speak of them , they are more than can be numbered .
I have not hid THY righteousness within my heart ; I have declared THY faithfulness and THY salvation : I have not concealed THY lovingkindness and THY truth from the great Congregation .
for innumerable evils have compassed me about : mine iniquities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the hairs of mine head : therefore my heart faileth me .
the Lord will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be blessed upon the earth : and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies .
Yea , mine own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , which did eat of my bread , hath lifted up his heel against me .
yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the God of my life .
for they got not the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them : but THY right hand , and thine arm , and the light of THY countenance , because thou hadst a favour unto them .
he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth ; he breaketh the bow , and cutteth the spear in sunder ; he burneth the chariot in the fire .
these things hast thou done , and I kept silence ; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself : but I will reprove thee , and set them in order before thine eyes .
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever , he shall take thee away , and pluck thee out of THY dwelling place , and root thee out of the land of the living . Selah .
there were they in great fear , where no fear was : for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee : thou hast put them to shame , because God hath despised them .
for it was not an enemy that reproached me ; then I could have borne it : neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me ; then I would have hid myself from him :
be merciful unto me , O God , be merciful unto me : for my soul trusteth in thee : yea , in the shadow of THY wings will I make my refuge , until these calamities be overpast .
my soul is among lions : and I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves . Selah .
as a snail which melteth , let every one of them pass away : like the untimely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
blessed is the man whom thou choosest , and causest to approach unto thee , that he may dwell in THY courts : we shall be satisfied with the Goodness of THY house , even of THY holy temple .
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea :
the chariots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of angels : the Lord is among them , as in Sinai , in the holy place .
to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens , which were of old ; lo , he doth send out his voice , and that a mighty voice .
they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mine enemies wrongfully , are mighty : then I restored that which I took not away .
but as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O Lord , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of THY mercy hear me , in the truth of THY salvation .
reproach hath broken my heart ; and I am full of heaviness : and I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none .
now also when I am old and grayheaded , O God , forsake me not ; until I have shewed THY strength unto this generation , and THY power to every one that is to come .
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth .
for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup , and the wine is red ; it is full of mixture ; and he poureth out of the same : but the dregs thereof , all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out , and drink them .
we will not hide them from their children , shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord , and his strength , and his wonderful works that he hath done .
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation ; a generation that set not their heart aright , and whose spirit was not stedfast with God .
the dead bodies of THY servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven , the flesh of THY saints unto the beasts of the earth .
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me ; thou hast made me an abomination unto them : I am shut up , and I cannot come forth .
and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us : and establish thou the work of our hands upon us ; yea , the work of our hands establish thou it .
the Lord reigneth , he is clothed with majesty ; the Lord is clothed with strength , wherewith he hath girded himself : the world also is stablished , that it cannot be moved .
the Lord hath been mindful of us : he will bless us ; he will bless the house of Israel ; he will bless the house of Aaron .
behold , as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters , and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress ; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God , until that he have mercy upon us .
though I walk in the midst of trouble , thou wilt revive me : thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies , and THY right hand shall save me .
Thine eyes did see my substance , yet being unperfect ; and in THY book all my members were written , which in continuance were fashioned , when as yet there was none of them .
let the righteous smite me ; it shall be a kindness : and let him reprove me ; it shall be an excellent oil , which shall not break my head : for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities .
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me , then thou knewest my path . in the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me .
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul ; he hath smitten my life down to the ground ; he hath made me to dwell in darkness , as those that have been long dead .
cause me to hear THY lovingkindness in the morning ; for in thee do I trust : cause me to know the way wherein I should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto thee .
when thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid : yea , thou shalt lie down , and THY sleep shall be sweet .
even a fool , when he holdeth his peace , is counted wise : and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding .
a man 's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth ; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled .
the fear of the Lord tendeth to life : and he that hath it shall abide satisfied ; he shall not be visited with evil .
it is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy , and after vows to make inquiry .
if thou sayest , behold , we knew it not ; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it ? and he that keepeth THY soul , doth not he know it ? and shall not he render to every man according to his works ?
if thine enemy be hungry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thirsty , give him water to drink :
Thine own friend , and THY father 's friend , forsake not ; neither go into THY brother 's house in the day of THY calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
the way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maid .
and I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven : this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith .
I communed with mine own heart , saying , Lo , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : yea , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
I gathered me also silver and gold , and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces : I gat me men singers and women singers , and the delights of the sons of men , as musical instruments , and that of all sorts .
then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought , and on the labour that I had laboured to do : and , behold , all was vanity and vexation of spirit , and there was no profit under the sun .
for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever ; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten . and how dieth the wise man ? as the fool .
and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured , and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun . this is also vanity .
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . this also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
so I returned , and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold the tears of such as were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but woe to him that is alone when he falleth ; for he hath not another to help him up .
there is no end of all the people , even of all that have been before them : they also that come after shall not rejoice in him . surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit .
be not rash with THY mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God : for God is in heaven , and thou upon earth : therefore let THY words be few .
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners thereof , saving the beholding of them with their eyes ?
as he came forth of his mother 's womb , naked shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
all things have I seen in the days of my vanity : there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness .
it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from this withdraw not thine hand : for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all .
I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom , and the reason of things , and to know the wickedness of Folly , even of foolishness and madness :
which yet my soul seeketh , but I find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all those have I not found .
and so I saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the holy , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also vanity .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
there is a vanity which is done upon the earth ; that there be just men , unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked ; again , there be wicked men , to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous : I said that this also is vanity .
when I applied mine heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done upon the earth : ( for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes : )
also their love , and their hatred , and their envy , is now perished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
for man also knoweth not his time : as the fishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare ; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falleth suddenly upon them .
dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour : so doth a little Folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour .
Yea also , when he that is a fool walketh by the way , his wisdom faileth him , and he saith to every one that he is a fool .
if the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child : even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be darkened ,
and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the grinding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low ;
or ever the silver cord be loosed , or the golden bowl be broken , or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , or the wheel broken at the cistern .
look not upon me , because I am black , because the sun hath looked upon me : my mother 's children were angry with me ; they made me the keeper of the vineyards ; but mine own vineyard have I not kept .
if thou know not , O thou fairest among women , go THY way forth by the footsteps of the flock , and feed THY kids beside the shepherds ' tents .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
the flowers appear on the earth ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land ;
O my dove , that art in the clefts of the rock , in the secret places of the stairs , let me see THY countenance , let me hear THY voice ; for sweet is THY voice , and THY countenance is comely .
I will rise now , and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth : I sought him , but I found him not .
it was but a little that I passed from them , but I found him whom my soul loveth : I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother 's house , and into the chamber of her that conceived me .
he made the pillars thereof of silver , the bottom thereof of gold , the covering of it of purple , the midst thereof being paved with love , for the daughters of Jerusalem .
go forth , O ye daughters of Zion , and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals , and in the day of the gladness of his heart .
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , I will get me to the mountain of myrrh , and to the hill of frankincense .
come with me from Lebanon , my spouse , with me from Lebanon : look from the top of Amana , from the top of Shenir and Hermon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
I opened to my beloved ; but my beloved had withdrawn himself , and was gone : my soul failed when he spake : I sought him , but I could not find him ; I called him , but he gave me no answer .
THY neck is as a tower of Ivory ; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon , by the gate of Bath @-@ rabbim : THY nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus .
O that thou wert as my brother , that sucked the breasts of my mother ! when I should find thee without , I would kiss thee ; yea , I should not be despised .
I would lead thee , and bring thee into my mother 's house , who would instruct me : I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate .
from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it ; but wounds , and bruises , and putrifying sores : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither mollified with ointment .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , that the mountain of the Lord 's house shall be established in the top of the mountains , and shall be exalted above the hills ; and all nations shall flow unto it .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots :
for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low : and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
and they shall go into the holes of the rocks , and into the caves of the earth , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
and the people shall be oppressed , every one by another , and every one by his neighbour : the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient , and the base against the honourable .
and it shall come to pass , that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink ; and instead of a girdle a rent ; and instead of well set hair baldness ; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth ; and burning instead of beauty .
and it shall come to pass , that he that is left in Zion , and he that remaineth in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem :
when the Lord shall have washed away the Filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
and the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion , and upon her assemblies , a cloud and smoke by day , and the shining of a flaming fire by night : for upon all the glory shall be a defence .
what could have been done more to my vineyard , that I have not done in it ? wherefore , when I looked that it should bring forth grapes , brought it forth wild grapes ?
and now go to ; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard : I will take away the hedge thereof , and it shall be eaten up ; and break down the wall thereof , and it shall be trodden down :
and the harp , and the viol , the tabret , and pipe , and wine , are in their feasts : but they regard not the work of the Lord , neither consider the operation of his hands .
and the mean man shall be brought down , and the mighty man shall be humbled , and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled :
that say , Let him make speed , and hasten his work , that we may see it : and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come , that we may know it !
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far , and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
none shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken :
their roaring shall be like a lion , they shall roar like young lions : yea , they shall roar , and lay hold of the prey , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
and it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up toward Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
and it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is confederate with Ephraim . and his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
and say unto him , Take heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands , for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria , and of the son of Remaliah .
let us go up against Judah , and vex it , and let us make a breach therein for us , and set a king in the midst of it , even the son of Tabeal :
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thorns , and upon all bushes .
in the same day shall the Lord shave with a rasor that is hired , namely , by them beyond the river , by the king of Assyria , the head , and the hair of the feet : and it shall also consume the beard .
and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings , it shall even be for briers and thorns .
and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock , there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns : but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of lesser cattle .
for the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
and he shall be for a sanctuary ; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel , for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and they shall pass through it , hardly bestead and hungry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hungry , they shall fret themselves , and curse their king and their God , and look upward .
for wickedness burneth as the fire : it shall devour the briers and thorns , and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest , and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke .
and he shall snatch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm :
and what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your glory ?
shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith ? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it ? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up , or as if the staff should lift up itself , as if it were no wood .
and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame : and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day ;
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the remnant of Israel , and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob , shall no more again stay upon him that smote them ; but shall stay upon the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off THY shoulder , and his yoke from off THY neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing .
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither reprove after the hearing of his ears :
but with righteousness shall he judge the poor , and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth : and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth , and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked .
and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse , which shall stand for an ensign of the people ; to it shall the Gentiles seek : and his rest shall be glorious .
and he shall set up an ensign for the nations , and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel , and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth .
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west ; they shall spoil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab ; and the children of Ammon shall obey them .
for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light : the sun shall be darkened in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to shine .
and it shall be as the chased roe , and as a sheep that no man taketh up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb ; their eye shall not spare children .
and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses , and dragons in their pleasant palaces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prolonged .
for the Lord will have mercy on Jacob , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land : and the strangers shall be joined with them , and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee rest from THY sorrow , and from THY fear , and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve ,
that I will break the Assyrian in my land , and upon my mountains tread him under foot : then shall his yoke depart from off them , and his burden depart from off their shoulders .
rejoice not thou , whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent 's root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent .
and Heshbon shall cry , and Elealeh : their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz : therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out ; his life shall be grievous unto him .
my heart shall cry out for Moab ; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar , an heifer of three years old : for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up ; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction .
and in mercy shall the throne be established : and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David , judging , and seeking judgment , and hasting righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Moab ; he is very proud : even of his haughtiness , and his pride , and his wrath : but his lies shall not be so .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
and in that day it shall come to pass , that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean .
and he shall not look to the altars , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fingers have made , either the groves , or the images .
in the day shalt thou make THY plant to grow , and in the morning shalt thou make THY seed to flourish : but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
Woe to the multitude of many people , which make a noise like the noise of the seas ; and to the rushing of nations , that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters !
the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters : but God shall rebuke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind .
for afore the harvest , when the bud is perfect , and the sour grape is ripening in the flower , he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks , and take away and cut down the branches .
they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains , and to the beasts of the earth : and the fowls shall summer upon them , and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them .
the burden of Egypt . behold , the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud , and shall come into Egypt : and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it .
and the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof ; and I will destroy the counsel thereof : and they shall seek to the idols , and to the charmers , and to them that have familiar spirits , and to the wizards .
and they shall turn the rivers far away ; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up : the reeds and flags shall wither .
the paper reeds by the brooks , by the mouth of the brooks , and every thing sown by the brooks , shall wither , be driven away , and be no more .
in that day shall Egypt be like unto women : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which he shaketh over it .
and the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt , every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself , because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts , which he hath determined against it .
and the Lord shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and oblation ; yea , they shall vow a vow unto the Lord , and perform it .
and the Lord shall smite Egypt : he shall smite and heal it : and they shall return even to the Lord , and he shall be intreated of them , and shall heal them .
therefore are my loins filled with pain : pangs have taken hold upon me , as the pangs of a woman that travaileth : I was bowed down at the hearing of it ; I was dismayed at the seeing of it .
what hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here , as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high , and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock ?
and I will clothe him with THY robe , and strengthen him with THY girdle , and I will commit THY government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , all vessels of small quantity , from the vessels of cups , even to all the vessels of flagons .
he stretched out his hand over the sea , he shook the kingdoms : the Lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city , to destroy the strong holds thereof .
and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years , that the Lord will visit Tyre , and she shall turn to her hire , and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth .
when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree , and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done .
and it shall come to pass , that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for the windows from on high are open , and the foundations of the earth do shake .
the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard , and shall be removed like a cottage ; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the earth upon the earth .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers , as the heat in a dry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud : the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low .
and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
he will swallow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces ; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth : for the Lord hath spoken it .
and it shall be said in that day , Lo , this is our God ; we have waited for him , and he will save us : this is the Lord ; we have waited for him , we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them , as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim : and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands .
and the fortress of the high Fort of THY walls shall he bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the dust .
for he bringeth down them that dwell on high ; the lofty city , he layeth it low ; he layeth it low , even to the ground ; he bringeth it even to the dust .
Yea , in the way of THY judgments , O Lord , have we waited for thee ; the desire of our soul is to THY name , and to the remembrance of thee .
with my soul have I desired thee in the night ; yea , with my spirit within me will I seek thee early : for when THY judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness .
let favour be shewed to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly , and will not behold the majesty of the Lord .
we have been with child , we have been in pain , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter thou into THY chambers , and shut THY doors about thee : hide thyself as it were for a little moment , until the indignation be overpast .
when the boughs thereof are withered , they shall be broken off : the women come , and set them on fire : for it is a people of no understanding : therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them , and he that formed them will shew them no favour .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt , and ye shall be gathered one by one , O ye children of Israel .
and your Covenant with death shall be disannulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it .
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin ; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff , and the cummin with a rod .
moreover the multitude of THY strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away : yea , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
Wherefore the Lord said , Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth , and with their lips do honour me , but have removed their heart far from me , and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men :
therefore , behold , I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people , even a marvellous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity , and out of darkness .
but when he seeth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sanctify my name , and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
that walk to go down into Egypt , and have not asked at my mouth ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh , and to trust in the shadow of Egypt !
for the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem : thou shalt weep no more : he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of THY cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer thee .
and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
Ye shall defile also the covering of THY Graven images of silver , and the ornament of THY molten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
then shall he give the rain of THY seed , that thou shalt sow the ground withal ; and bread of the increase of the earth , and it shall be fat and plenteous : in that day shall THY cattle feed in large pastures .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
and his breath , as an overflowing stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity : and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people , causing them to err .
Ye shall have a song , as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept ; and gladness of heart , as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the Lord , to the mighty One of Israel .
and the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard , and shall shew the lighting down of his arm , with the indignation of his anger , and with the flame of a devouring fire , with scattering , and tempest , and hailstones .
and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass , which the Lord shall lay upon him , it shall be with tabrets and harps : and in battles of shaking will he fight with it .
Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help ; and stay on horses , and trust in chariots , because they are many ; and in horsemen , because they are very strong ; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel , neither seek the Lord !
yet he also is wise , and will bring evil , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of them that work iniquity .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when the Lord shall stretch out his hand , both he that helpeth shall fall , and he that is holpen shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which your own hands have made unto you for a sin .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
Thou shalt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive ; of a stammering tongue , that thou canst not understand .
their slain also shall be cast out , and their stink shall come up out of their carcases , and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
and all the host of heaven shall be dissolved , and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll : and all their host shall fall down , as the leaf falleth off from the vine , and as a falling fig from the fig tree .
it shall not be quenched night nor day ; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it ; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion , and the stones of emptiness .
and thorns shall come up in her palaces , nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof : and it shall be an habitation of dragons , and a court for owls .
the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island , and the satyr shall cry to his fellow ; the screech owl also shall rest there , and find for herself a place of rest .
it shall blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing : the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it , the excellency of Carmel and Sharon , they shall see the glory of the Lord , and the excellency of our God .
I say , sayest thou , ( but they are but vain words ) I have counsel and strength for war : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
Lo , thou trustest in the staff of this broken Reed , on Egypt ; whereon if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and Pierce it : so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him .
now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on THY part to set riders upon them .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put THY trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , Hear ye the words of the great king , the king of Assyria .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will surely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
then came Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , that was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
and it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the Lord .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not THY God , in whom thou trustest , deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed , as Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Telassar ?
and Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted THY voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
Hast thou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded : they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
because THY rage against me , and THY tumult , is come up into mine ears , therefore will I put my hook in THY nose , and my bridle in THY lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
then the angel of the Lord went forth , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
and it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Armenia : and Esar @-@ haddon his son reigned in his stead .
and said , Remember now , O Lord , I beseech thee , how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in THY sight . and Hezekiah wept sore .
mine age is departed , and is removed from me as a shepherd 's tent : I have cut off like a weaver my life : he will cut me off with pining sickness : from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me .
behold , for peace I had great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sins behind THY back .
at that time Merodach @-@ baladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah : for he had heard that he had been sick , and was recovered .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which THY fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the Lord .
and of THY sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
he shall feed his flock like a shepherd : he shall gather the lambs with his arm , and carry them in his bosom , and shall gently lead those that are with young .
who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand , and meted out heaven with the span , and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scales , and the hills in a balance ?
behold , the nations are as a drop of a bucket , and are counted as the small dust of the balance : behold , he taketh up the isles as a very little thing .
it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers ; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain , and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in :
Hast thou not known ? hast thou not heard , that the everlasting God , the Lord , the Creator of the ends of the earth , fainteth not , neither is weary ? there is no searching of his understanding .
so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith , and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil , saying , It is ready for the sodering : and he fastened it with nails , that it should not be moved .
Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth , and called thee from the chief men thereof , and said unto thee , Thou art my servant ; I have chosen thee , and not cast thee away .
fear thou not ; for I am with thee : be not dismayed ; for I am THY God : I will strengthen thee ; yea , I will help thee ; yea , I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness .
Thou shalt seek them , and shalt not find them , even them that contended with thee : they that war against thee shall be as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
Thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers in high places , and fountains in the midst of the valleys : I will make the wilderness a pool of water , and the dry land springs of water .
I will plant in the wilderness the cedar , the shittah tree , and the myrtle , and the oil tree ; I will set in the desert the fir tree , and the pine , and the box tree together :
let them bring them forth , and shew us what shall happen : let them shew the former things , what they be , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or declare us things for to come .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon morter , and as the Potter treadeth clay .
who hath declared from the beginning , that we may know ? and beforetime , that we may say , He is righteous ? yea , there is none that sheweth , yea , there is none that declareth , yea , there is none that heareth your words .
for I beheld , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no counseller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
thus saith God the Lord , he that created the heavens , and stretched them out ; he that spread forth the earth , and that which cometh out of it ; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it , and spirit to them that walk therein :
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that Kedar doth inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
the Lord shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , yea , roar ; he shall prevail against his enemies .
therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger , and the strength of battle : and it hath set him on fire round about , yet he knew not ; and it burned him , yet he laid it not to heart .
when thou passest through the waters , I will be with thee ; and through the rivers , they shall not overflow thee : when thou walkest through the fire , thou shalt not be burned ; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee .
thus saith the Lord , your redeemer , the Holy One of Israel ; For your sake I have sent to Babylon , and have brought down all their nobles , and the Chaldeans , whose cry is in the ships .
the beast of the field shall honour me , the dragons and the owls : because I give waters in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen .
Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of THY burnt offerings ; neither hast thou honoured me with THY sacrifices . I have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wearied thee with incense .
Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of THY sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with THY sins , thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities .
behold , all his fellows shall be ashamed : and the workmen , they are of men : let them all be gathered together , let them stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be ashamed together .
the Smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals , and fashioneth it with hammers , and worketh it with the strength of his arms : yea , he is hungry , and his strength faileth : he drinketh no water , and is faint .
I will go before thee , and make the crooked places straight : I will break in pieces the gates of brass , and cut in sunder the bars of iron :
and I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou mayest know that I , the Lord , which call thee by THY name , am the God of Israel .
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none beside me . I am the Lord , and there is none else .
they lavish gold out of the bag , and weigh silver in the balance , and hire a goldsmith ; and he maketh it a god : they fall down , yea , they worship .
they bear him upon the shoulder , they carry him , and set him in his place , and he standeth ; from his place shall he not remove : yea , one shall cry unto him , yet can he not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man that executeth my counsel from a far country : yea , I have spoken it , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed it , I will also do it .
and thou saidst , I shall be a lady for ever : so that thou didst not lay these things to THY heart , neither didst remember the latter end of it .
stand now with thine enchantments , and with the multitude of THY sorceries , wherein thou hast laboured from THY youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profit , if so be thou mayest prevail .
hear ye this , O house of Jacob , which are called by the name of Israel , and are come forth out of the waters of Judah , which swear by the name of the Lord , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth , nor in righteousness .
I have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of my mouth , and I shewed them ; I did them suddenly , and they came to pass .
I have even from the beginning declared it to thee ; before it came to pass I shewed it thee : lest thou shouldest say , Mine idol hath done them , and my Graven image , and my molten image , hath commanded them .
Yea , thou heardest not ; yea , thou knewest not ; yea , from that time that thine ear was not opened : for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously , and wast called a transgressor from the womb .
come ye near unto me , hear ye this ; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning ; from the time that it was , there am I : and now the Lord God , and his Spirit , hath sent me .
and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he clave the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
listen , O isles , unto me ; and hearken , ye people , from far ; The Lord hath called me from the womb ; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name .
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made me a polished Shaft ; in his quiver hath he hid me ;
the children which thou shalt have , after thou hast lost the other , shall say again in thine ears , The place is too strait for me : give place to me that I may dwell .
thus saith the Lord God , behold , I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles , and set up my standard to the people : and they shall bring THY sons in their arms , and THY daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders .
and kings shall be THY nursing fathers , and their queens THY nursing mothers : they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth , and lick up the dust of THY feet ; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord : for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me .
thus saith the Lord , Where is the bill of your mother 's divorcement , whom I have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? behold , for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves , and for your transgressions is your mother put away .
the Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary : he wakeneth morning by morning , he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned .
for the Lord God will help me ; therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore have I set my face like a Flint , and I know that I shall not be ashamed .
who is among you that feareth the Lord , that obeyeth the voice of his servant , that walketh in darkness , and hath no light ? let him trust in the name of the Lord , and stay upon his God .
Hearken to me , ye that follow after righteousness , ye that seek the Lord : look unto the rock whence ye are hewn , and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged .
for the Lord shall comfort Zion : he will comfort all her waste places ; and he will make her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of the Lord ; joy and gladness shall be found therein , Thanksgiving , and the voice of melody .
art thou not it which hath dried the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over ?
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth ; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up .
THY sons have fainted , they lie at the head of all the streets , as a wild bull in a net : they are full of the fury of the Lord , the rebuke of THY God .
thus saith THY Lord the Lord , and THY God that pleadeth the cause of his people , behold , I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling , even the dregs of the cup of my fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again :
but I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee ; which have said to THY soul , bow down , that we may go over : and thou hast laid THY body as the ground , and as the street , to them that went over .
the Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God .
depart ye , depart ye , go ye out from thence , touch no unclean thing ; go ye out of the midst of her ; be ye clean , that bear the vessels of the Lord .
for ye shall not go out with haste , nor go by flight : for the Lord will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rereward .
so shall he sprinkle many nations ; the kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of a dry ground : he hath no form nor comeliness ; and when we shall see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
he was oppressed , and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his mouth : he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he openeth not his mouth .
fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou confounded ; for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of THY youth , and shalt not remember the reproach of THY widowhood any more .
for this is as the waters of Noah unto me : for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth ; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee , nor rebuke thee .
for the mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the Covenant of my peace be removed , saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee .
Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labour for that which satisfieth not ? hearken diligently unto me , and eat ye that which is good , and let your soul delight itself in fatness .
behold , thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not , and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord THY God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hath glorified thee .
let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts : and let him return unto the Lord , and he will have mercy upon him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
for as the rain cometh down , and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth , and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater :
so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it .
for ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands .
instead of the Thorn shall come up the fir tree , and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree : and it shall be to the Lord for a name , for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off .
even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar ; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people .
Yea , they are greedy dogs which can never have enough , and they are shepherds that cannot understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
for thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity , whose name is Holy ; I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite ones .
Wherefore have we fasted , say they , and thou seest not ? wherefore have we afflicted our soul , and thou takest no knowledge ? behold , in the day of your fast ye find pleasure , and exact all your labours .
behold , ye fast for strife and debate , and to smite with the fist of wickedness : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
is it not to deal THY bread to the hungry , and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to THY house ? when thou seest the naked , that thou cover him ; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh ?
then shall THY light break forth as the morning , and thine health shall spring forth speedily : and THY righteousness shall go before thee ; the glory of the Lord shall be THY rereward .
then shalt thou call , and the Lord shall answer ; thou shalt cry , and he shall say , Here I am . if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking vanity ;
and the Lord shall guide thee continually , and satisfy THY soul in drought , and make fat THY bones : and thou shalt be like a watered garden , and like a spring of water , whose waters fail not .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
for he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and an helmet of salvation upon his head ; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeal as a cloke .
as for me , this is my Covenant with them , saith the Lord ; My spirit that is upon thee , and my words which I have put in THY mouth , shall not depart out of THY mouth , nor out of the mouth of THY seed , nor out of the mouth of THY seed 's seed , saith the Lord , from henceforth and for ever .
then thou shalt see , and flow together , and thine heart shall fear , and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee , the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee .
the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee ; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of THY feet ; and they shall call thee , The city of the Lord , The Zion of the Holy One of Israel .
the sun shall be no more THY light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee : but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light , and THY God THY glory .
THY sun shall no more go down ; neither shall THY moon withdraw itself : for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light , and the days of THY mourning shall be ended .
but ye shall be named the priests of the Lord : men shall call you the Ministers of our God : ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles , and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves .
for as the earth bringeth forth her bud , and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth ; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth .
the Lord hath sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , surely I will no more give THY corn to be meat for thine enemies ; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink THY wine , for the which thou hast laboured :
and I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me ; and my fury , it upheld me .
I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the Lord , and the praises of the Lord , according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us , and the great Goodness toward the house of Israel , which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies , and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses .
in all their affliction he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he redeemed them ; and he bare them , and carried them all the days of old .
but we are all as an unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags ; and we all do fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , like the wind , have taken us away .
and there is none that calleth upon THY name , that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee : for thou hast hid THY face from us , and hast consumed us , because of our iniquities .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , behold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
and Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in , for my people that have sought me .
and I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree are the days of my people , and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
I also will choose their delusions , and will bring their fears upon them ; because when I called , none did answer ; when I spake , they did not hear : but they did evil before mine eyes , and chose that in which I delighted not .
and they shall go forth , and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be quenched ; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh .
and I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , who have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , and worshipped the works of their own hands .
Hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken the Lord THY God , when he led thee by the way ?
and now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of Sihor ? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria , to drink the waters of the river ?
a wild ass used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
but where are THY gods that thou hast made thee ? let them arise , if they can save thee in the time of THY trouble : for according to the number of THY cities are THY gods , O Judah .
and I saw , when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away , and given her a bill of divorce ; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not , but went and played the harlot also .
at that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord ; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it , to the name of the Lord , to Jerusalem : neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart .
in those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers .
the lion is come up from his thicket , and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place to make THY land desolate ; and THY cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabitant .
my bowels , my bowels ! I am pained at my very heart ; my heart maketh a noise in me ; I cannot hold my peace , because thou hast heard , O my soul , the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war .
run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem , and see now , and know , and seek in the broad places thereof , if ye can find a man , if there be any that executeth judgment , that seeketh the truth ; and I will pardon it .
I will get me unto the great men , and will speak unto them ; for they have known the way of the Lord , and the judgment of their God : but these have altogether broken the yoke , and burst the bonds .
how shall I pardon thee for this ? THY children have forsaken me , and sworn by them that are no gods : when I had fed them to the full , they then committed adultery , and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots ' houses .
and they shall eat up thine harvest , and THY bread , which THY sons and THY daughters should eat : they shall eat up THY flocks and thine herds : they shall eat up THY vines and THY fig trees : they shall impoverish THY fenced cities , wherein thou trustedst , with the sword .
they are waxen fat , they shine : yea , they overpass the deeds of the wicked : they judge not the cause , the cause of the fatherless , yet they prosper ; and the right of the needy do they not judge .
to whom shall I speak , and give warning , that they may hear ? behold , their ear is uncircumcised , and they cannot hearken : behold , the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach ; they have no delight in it .
for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
they shall lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roareth like the sea ; and they ride upon horses , set in array as men for war against thee , O daughter of Zion .
and now , because ye have done all these works , saith the Lord , and I spake unto you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answered not ;
the children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead their dough , to make cakes to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods , that they may provoke me to anger .
for I spake not unto your fathers , nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
but this thing commanded I them , saying , obey my voice , and I will be your God , and ye shall be my people : and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you , that it may be well unto you .
since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets , daily rising up early and sending them :
therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them ; but they will not hearken to thee : thou shalt also call unto them ; but they will not answer thee .

for I will set mine eyes upon them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pluck them up .

to wit , Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and the kings thereof , and the princes thereof , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , an hissing , and a curse ; as it is this day ;
and all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of Uz , and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Azzah , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdoms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .

to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hearkened ;

within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried them to Babylon :
and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah , that went into Babylon , saith the Lord : for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon .
then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord ,
then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) saying ,
thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , unto all that are carried away captives , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon ;
take ye wives , and beget sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; that ye may be increased there , and not diminished .
for thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Let not your prophets and your diviners , that be in the midst of you , deceive you , neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed .

thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , Because thou hast sent letters in THY name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem , and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
the Lord hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest , that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord , for every man that is mad , and maketh himself a prophet , that thou shouldest put him in prison , and in the stocks .
send to all them of the captivity , saying , Thus saith the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite ; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you , and I sent him not , and he caused you to trust in a lie :
all THY lovers have forgotten thee ; they seek thee not ; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one , for the multitude of thine iniquity ; because THY sins were increased .
therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured ; and all thine adversaries , every one of them , shall go into captivity ; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil , and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey .
for I will restore health unto thee , and I will heal thee of THY wounds , saith the Lord ; because they called thee an outcast , saying , This is Zion , whom no man seeketh after .
thus saith the Lord ; behold , I will bring again the captivity of Jacob 's tents , and have mercy on his dwellingplaces ; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap , and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof .

behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of beast .

not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my Covenant they brake , although I was an husband unto them , saith the Lord :
thus saith the Lord ; If heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , saith the Lord .
for then the king of Babylon 's army besieged Jerusalem : and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Judah 's house .
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall behold his eyes ;
thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Take these evidences , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an earthen vessel , that they may continue many days .
great in counsel , and mighty in work : for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings :
and hast brought forth THY people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with great terror ;
and they came in , and possessed it ; but they obeyed not THY voice , neither walked in THY law ; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do : therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them :
for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , saith the Lord .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
and they have turned unto me the back , and not the face : though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction .
behold , I will gather them out of all countries , whither I have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will make an everlasting Covenant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hearts , that they shall not depart from me .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
for thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , concerning the houses of this city , and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah , which are thrown down by the mounts , and by the sword ;
and I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , whereby they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , whereby they have sinned , and whereby they have transgressed against me .
in the cities of the mountains , in the cities of the vale , and in the cities of the south , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them , saith the Lord .
Considerest thou not what this people have spoken , saying , The two families which the Lord hath chosen , he hath even cast them off ? thus they have despised my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
the word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion , and all the people , fought against Jerusalem , and against all the cities thereof , saying ,
thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel ; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah , and tell him , Thus saith the Lord ; behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
this is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , after that the king Zedekiah had made a Covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them ;
that every man should let his manservant , and every man his maidservant , being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to wit , of a Jew his brother .
but afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel ; I made a Covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondmen , saying ,
at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew , which hath been sold unto thee ; and when he hath served thee six years , thou shalt let him go free from thee : but your fathers hearkened not unto me , neither inclined their ear .
but ye turned and polluted my name , and caused every man his servant , and every man his handmaid , whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure , to return , and brought them into subjection , to be unto you for servants and for handmaids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven , and to the beasts of the earth .
and Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which are gone up from you .
go unto the house of the Rechabites , and speak unto them , and bring them into the house of the Lord , into one of the chambers , and give them wine to drink .
thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , nor our daughters ;
but it came to pass , when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians : so we dwell at Jerusalem .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spake unto thee , from the days of Josiah , even unto this day .
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah : and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken unto him , upon a roll of a book .
therefore go thou , and read in the roll , which thou hast written from my mouth , the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord 's house upon the fasting day : and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities .
it may be they will present their supplication before the Lord , and will return every one from his evil way : for great is the anger and the fury that the Lord hath pronounced against this people .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , in the ninth month , that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem , and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem .
then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house , in the ears of all the people .
then he went down into the king 's house , into the scribe 's chamber : and , lo , all the princes sat there , even Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the son of Achbor , and Gemariah the son of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the princes .
therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Cushi , unto Baruch , saying , Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people , and come . so Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand , and came unto them .
and they went in to the king into the court , but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe , and told all the words in the ears of the king .
so the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll : and he took it out of Elishama the scribe 's chamber . and Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king .
then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the roll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
therefore thus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim king of Judah ; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the Frost .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did hearken unto the words of the Lord , which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah .
thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah , that sent you unto me to inquire of me ; behold , Pharaoh 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
for though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
and it came to pass , that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah , and smote him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe : for they had made that the prison .
therefore hear now , I pray thee , O my lord the king : let my supplication , I pray thee , be accepted before thee ; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there .
then Shephatiah the son of Mattan , and Gedaliah the son of Pashur , and Jucal the son of Shelemiah , and Pashur the son of Malchiah , heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people , saying ,
thus saith the Lord , He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live ; for he shall have his life for a prey , and shall live .
then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jeremiah with cords . and in the dungeon there was no water , but mire : so Jeremiah sunk in the mire .
now when Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian , one of the eunuchs which was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ;
my lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is : for there is no more bread in the city .
so Ebed @-@ melech took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags , and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
so they drew up Jeremiah with cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the Lord : and the king said unto Jeremiah , I will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me .
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver thee . obey , I beseech thee , the voice of the Lord , which I speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and THY soul shall live .
so they shall bring out all THY wives and THY children to the Chaldeans : and thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire .
but if the princes hear that I have talked with thee , and they come unto thee , and say unto thee , declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king , hide it not from us , and we will not put thee to death ; also what the king said unto thee :
and it came to pass , that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them , and all the men of war , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's garden , by the gate betwixt the two walls : and he went out the way of the plain .
but the Chaldeans ' army pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he gave judgment upon him .
then Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
but Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
even they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he dwelt among the people .
but I will deliver thee in that day , saith the Lord : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
for I will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but THY life shall be for a prey unto thee : because thou hast put THY trust in me , saith the Lord .
the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , after that Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah , which were carried away captive unto Babylon .
now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed unto him men , and women , and children , and of the poor of the land , of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon ;
then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
as for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans , which will come unto us : but ye , gather ye wine , and summer fruits , and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that ye have taken .
likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab , and among the Ammonites , and in Edom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan ;
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , and the princes of the king , even ten men with him , came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah .
then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men that were with him , and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword , and slew him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him , even with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans that were found there , and the men of war .
and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said unto them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
and it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men that were with him .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them , I have heard you ; behold , I will pray unto the Lord your God according to your words ; and it shall come to pass , that whatsoever thing the Lord shall answer you , I will declare it unto you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of the Lord our God , to whom we send thee ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of the Lord our God .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
if ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pluck you up : for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you .
be not afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom ye are afraid ; be not afraid of him , saith the Lord : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
and now therefore hear the word of the Lord , ye remnant of Judah ; Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to sojourn there ;
then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye feared , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine , whereof ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there ; they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them .
for ye dissembled in your hearts , when ye sent me unto the Lord your God , saying , pray for us unto the Lord our God ; and according unto all that the Lord our God shall say , so declare unto us , and we will do it .
and now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you .
and it came to pass , that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the Lord their God , for which the Lord their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away captives into Babylon .
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , obeyed not the voice of the Lord , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , that were returned from all nations , whither they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Judah ;
so they came into the land of Egypt : for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord : thus came they even to Tahpanhes .
take great stones in thine hand , and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
and when he cometh , he shall smite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for captivity to captivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt , which dwell at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Noph , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of Judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives , which they have committed in the land of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
they are not humbled even unto this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
for I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence :
then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods , and all the women that stood by , a great multitude , even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt , in Pathros , answered Jeremiah , saying ,
as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord , we will not hearken unto thee .
then Jeremiah said unto all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people which had given him that answer , saying ,
so that the Lord could no longer bear , because of the evil of your doings , and because of the abominations which ye have committed ; therefore is your land a desolation , and an astonishment , and a curse , without an inhabitant , as at this day .
behold , I will watch over them for evil , and not for good : and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until there be an end of them .
the word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah , when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying ,
against Egypt , against the army of Pharaoh @-@ necho king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye chariots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiopians and the Libyans , that handle the shield ; and the Lydians , that handle and bend the bow .
he made many to fall , yea , one fell upon another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our nativity , from the oppressing sword .
also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their calamity was come upon them , and the time of their visitation .
the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saith ; behold , I will punish the multitude of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , with their gods , and their kings ; even Pharaoh , and all them that trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants : and afterward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , saith the Lord .
but fear not thou , O my servant Jacob , and be not dismayed , O Israel : for , behold , I will save thee from afar off , and THY seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
Moab hath been at ease from his youth , and he hath settled on his lees , and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither hath he gone into captivity : therefore his taste remained in him , and his scent is not changed .
O vine of Sibmah , I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer : THY plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of Jazer : the spoiler is fallen upon THY summer fruits and upon THY vintage .
from the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh , and even unto Jahaz , have they uttered their voice , from Zoar even unto Horonaim , as an heifer of three years old : for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate .
he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring upon it , even upon Moab , the year of their visitation , saith the Lord .
they that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force : but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon , and a flame from the midst of Sihon , and shall devour the corner of Moab , and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones .
behold , I will bring a fear upon thee , saith the Lord God of hosts , from all those that be about thee ; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth ; and none shall gather up him that wandereth .
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is spoiled , and his brethren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
for thus saith the Lord ; behold , they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken ; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished ? thou shalt not go unpunished , but thou shalt surely drink of it .
therefore hear the counsel of the Lord , that he hath taken against Edom ; and his purposes , that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : surely the least of the flock shall draw them out : surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread his wings over Bozrah : and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
and their camels shall be a booty , and the multitude of their cattle a spoil : and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners ; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof , saith the Lord .
and upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come .
for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they shall remove , they shall depart , both man and beast .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
in those days , and in that time , saith the Lord , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Judah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I reserve .
I have laid a snare for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou wast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast striven against the Lord .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God , the vengeance of his temple .
a sword is upon their horses , and upon their chariots , and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is upon her treasures ; and they shall be robbed .
therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there , and the owls shall dwell therein : and it shall be no more inhabited for ever ; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation .
therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord , that he hath taken against Babylon ; and his purposes , that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans : surely the least of the flock shall draw them out : surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them .
against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow , and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine : and spare ye not her young men ; destroy ye utterly all her host .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her iniquity ; for this is the time of the Lord 's vengeance ; he will render unto her a recompence .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go every one into his own country : for her judgment reacheth unto heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
make bright the arrows ; gather the shields : the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes : for his device is against Babylon , to destroy it ; because it is the vengeance of the Lord , the vengeance of his temple .
when he uttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens ; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth : he maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his Rider ; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his Rider ;
with thee also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young ; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid ;
I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock ; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen ; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers .
and the land shall tremble and sorrow : for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Babylon , to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant .
and I will punish Bel in Babylon , and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up : and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him : yea , the wall of Babylon shall fall .
therefore , behold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the Graven images of Babylon : and her whole land shall be confounded , and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
then shalt thou say , O Lord , thou hast spoken against this place , to cut it off , that none shall remain in it , neither man nor beast , but that it shall be desolate for ever .
and it shall be , when thou hast made an end of reading this book , that thou shalt bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of Euphrates :
for through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , till he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it , and built forts against it round about .
and in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was sore in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , came Nebuzar @-@ adan , captain of the guard , which served the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem ,
and burned the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , and all the houses of the great men , burned he with fire :
then Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people , and the residue of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to the king of Babylon , and the rest of the multitude .
also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans brake , and carried all the brass of them to Babylon .
and the basons , and the firepans , and the bowls , and the caldrons , and the candlesticks , and the spoons , and the cups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
and a chapiter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about , all of brass . the second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these .
and the king of Babylon smote them , and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath . thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land .
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his diet , there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks : among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her , they are become her enemies .
the adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things : for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary , whom thou didst command that they should not enter into THY Congregation .
from above hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them : he hath spread a net for my feet , he hath turned me back : he hath made me desolate and faint all the day .
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand : they are wreathed , and come up upon my neck : he hath made my strength to fall , the Lord hath delivered me into their hands , from whom I am not able to rise up .
the Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me : he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men : the Lord hath trodden the virgin , the daughter of Judah , as in a winepress .
how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger !
the Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob , and hath not pitied : he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah ; he hath brought them down to the ground : he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof .
he hath bent his bow like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an adversary , and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion : he poured out his fury like fire .
the Lord was as an enemy : he hath swallowed up Israel , he hath swallowed up all her palaces : he hath destroyed his strong holds , and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
the Lord hath cast off his altar , he hath abhorred his sanctuary , he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces ; they have made a noise in the house of the Lord , as in the day of a solemn feast .
the elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground , and keep silence : they have cast up dust upon their heads ; they have girded themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
mine eyes do fail with tears , my bowels are troubled , my liver is poured upon the earth , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city .
the Lord hath done that which he had devised ; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old : he hath thrown down , and hath not pitied : and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee , he hath set up the Horn of thine adversaries .
their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thyself no rest ; let not the apple of thine eye cease .
arise , cry out in the night : in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up THY hands toward him for the life of THY young children , that faint for hunger in the top of every street .
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword ; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger ; thou hast killed , and not pitied .
even the sea monsters draw out the breast , they give suck to their young ones : the daughter of my people is become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaketh it unto them .
for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom , that was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands stayed on her .
they that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger : for these pine away , stricken through for want of the fruits of the field .
the kings of the earth , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem .
the anger of the Lord hath divided them ; he will no more regard them : they respected not the persons of the priests , they favoured not the elders .
rejoice and be glad , O daughter of Edom , that dwellest in the land of Uz ; the cup also shall pass through unto thee : thou shalt be drunken , and shalt make thyself naked .
now it came to pass in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
and I looked , and , behold , a whirlwind came out of the north , a great cloud , and a fire infolding itself , and a brightness was about it , and out of the midst thereof as the colour of Amber , out of the midst of the fire .
also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures . and this was their appearance ; they had the likeness of a man .
and their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot : and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass .
as for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , and like the appearance of lamps : it went up and down among the living creatures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl : and they four had one likeness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
Whithersoever the spirit was to go , they went , thither was their spirit to go ; and the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
and under the firmament were their wings straight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
and when they went , I heard the noise of their wings , like the noise of great waters , as the voice of the Almighty , the voice of speech , as the noise of an host : when they stood , they let down their wings .
and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone : and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and I saw as the colour of Amber , as the appearance of fire round about within it , from the appearance of his loins even upward , and from the appearance of his loins even downward , I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and it had brightness round about .
and they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear , ( for they are a rebellious house , ) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them .
not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language , whose words thou canst not understand . surely , had I sent thee to them , they would have hearkened unto thee .
and go , get thee to them of the captivity , unto the children of THY people , and speak unto them , and tell them , Thus saith the Lord God ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another , and the noise of the wheels over against them , and a noise of a great rushing .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the Lord stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar : and I fell on my face .
but thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
and I will make THY tongue cleave to the roof of THY mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
but when I speak with thee , I will open THY mouth , and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; He that heareth , let him hear ; and he that forbeareth , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
and lay siege against it , and build a Fort against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set battering rams against it round about .
lie thou also upon THY left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it : according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity .
for I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and ninety days : so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
and , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of THY siege .
and thou , son of man , take thee a sharp knife , take thee a Barber 's rasor , and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon THY beard : then take thee balances to weight , and divide the hair .
then take of them again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations , and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judgments and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you , and have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept my judgments , neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you ;
and I will do in thee that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all thine abominations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds .
Wherefore , as I live , saith the Lord God ; surely , because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all THY detestable things , and with all thine abominations , therefore will I also diminish thee ; neither shall mine eye spare , neither will I have any pity .
when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine , which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine upon you , and will break your staff of bread :
and say , Ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God ; Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains , and to the hills , to the rivers , and to the valleys ; behold , I , even I , will bring a sword upon you , and I will destroy your high places .
and I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars .
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
and mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity : but I will recompense THY ways upon thee , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will recompense thee according to THY ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them mourning , every one for his iniquity .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty : but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein : therefore have I set it far from them .
and I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall pollute it .
Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be defiled .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me .
then I beheld , and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his loins even downward , fire ; and from his loins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of Amber .
then said he unto me , Son of man , lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel , and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , with every man his censer in his hand ; and a thick cloud of incense went up .
and he brought me into the inner court of the Lord 's house , and , behold , at the door of the temple of the Lord , between the porch and the altar , were about five and twenty men , with their backs toward the temple of the Lord , and their faces toward the east ; and they worshipped the sun toward the east .
therefore will I also deal in fury : mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clothed with linen , which had the writer 's inkhorn by his side ;
and the Lord said unto him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof .
then I looked , and , behold , in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord 's glory .
and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims , and took thereof , and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen : who took it , and went out .
and when I looked , behold the four wheels by the cherubims , one wheel by one cherub , and another wheel by another cherub : and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes round about , even the wheels that they four had .
and the cherubims lifted up their wings , and mounted up from the earth in my sight : when they went out , the wheels also were beside them , and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord 's house ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar , their appearances and themselves : they went every one straight forward .
and the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me , and said unto me , Speak ; Thus saith the Lord ; Thus have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
and I will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord : for ye have not walked in my statutes , neither executed my judgments , but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you .
and I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them an heart of flesh :
and the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
son of man , thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house , which have eyes to see , and see not ; they have ears to hear , and hear not : for they are a rebellious house .
in their sight shalt thou bear it upon THY shoulders , and carry it forth in the twilight : thou shalt cover THY face , that thou see not the ground : for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel .
and I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my stuff by day , as stuff for captivity , and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand ; I brought it forth in the twilight , and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight .
my net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare : and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
Ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord .
because , even because they have seduced my people , saying , Peace ; and there was no peace ; and one built up a wall , and , lo , others daubed it with untempered morter :
say unto them which daub it with untempered morter , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and ye , O great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall rend it .
so will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter , and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered , and it shall fall , and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire devoureth both the ends of it , and the midst of it is burned . is it meet for any work ?
behold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less shall it be meet yet for any work , when the fire hath devoured it , and it is burned ?
and I will set my face against them ; they shall go out from one fire , and another fire shall devour them ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I set my face against them .
and as for THY nativity , in the day thou wast born THY navel was not cut , neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee ; thou wast not salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
none eye pitied thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of THY person , in the day that thou wast born .
thus wast thou decked with gold and silver ; and THY raiment was of fine linen , and silk , and broidered work ; thou didst eat fine flour , and honey , and oil : and thou wast exceeding beautiful , and thou didst prosper into a kingdom .
and of THY garments thou didst take , and deckedst THY high places with divers colours , and playedst the harlot thereupon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
Thou hast also taken THY fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and madest to thyself images of men , and didst commit whoredom with them ,
my meat also which I gave thee , fine flour , and oil , and honey , wherewith I fed thee , thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour : and thus it was , saith the Lord God .
moreover thou hast taken THY sons and THY daughters , whom thou hast borne unto me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured . is this of THY whoredoms a small matter ,
Thou hast built THY high place at every head of the way , and hast made THY beauty to be abhorred , and hast opened THY feet to every one that passed by , and multiplied THY whoredoms .
thus saith the Lord God ; Because THY filthiness was poured out , and THY nakedness discovered through THY whoredoms with THY lovers , and with all the idols of THY abominations , and by the blood of THY children , which thou didst give unto them ;
and I will also give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down thine eminent place , and shall break down THY high places : they shall strip thee also of THY clothes , and shall take THY fair jewels , and leave thee naked and bare .
and they shall burn thine houses with fire , and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women : and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot , and thou also shalt give no hire any more .
so will I make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
Thou art THY mother 's daughter , that lotheth her husband and her children ; and thou art the sister of THY sisters , which lothed their husbands and their children : your mother was an Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
and thine elder sister is Samaria , she and her daughters that dwell at THY left hand : and THY younger sister , that dwelleth at THY right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
when I shall bring again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , then will I bring again the captivity of THY captives in the midst of them :
that thou mayest bear thine own shame , and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done , in that thou art a comfort unto them .
when THY sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate , and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate , then thou and THY daughters shall return to your former estate .
then thou shalt remember THY ways , and be ashamed , when thou shalt receive THY sisters , thine elder and THY younger : and I will give them unto thee for daughters , but not by THY Covenant .
that thou mayest remember , and be confounded , and never open THY mouth any more because of THY shame , when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done , saith the Lord God .
he cropped off the top of his young twigs , and carried it into a land of traffick ; he set it in a city of merchants .
it was planted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
as I live , saith the Lord God , surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose Covenant he brake , even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me .
and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword , and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds : and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it .
and hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither hath defiled his neighbour 's wife , neither hath come near to a menstruous woman ,
and hath not oppressed any , but hath restored to the debtor his pledge , hath spoiled none by violence , hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ;
neither hath oppressed any , hath not withholden the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
that hath taken off his hand from the poor , that hath not received usury nor increase , hath executed my judgments , hath walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
as for his father , because he cruelly oppressed , spoiled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , lo , even he shall die in his iniquity .
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
all his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live .
and it came to pass in the seventh year , in the fifth month , the tenth day of the month , that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord , and sat before me .
and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; In the day when I chose Israel , and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob , and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt , when I lifted up mine hand unto them , saying , I am the Lord your God ;
in the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands :
but I wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , among whom they were , in whose sight I made myself known unto them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
but I said unto their children in the wilderness , Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their judgments , nor defile yourselves with their idols :
nevertheless I withdrew mine hand , and wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen , in whose sight I brought them forth .
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
and I will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out .
and I will cause you to pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant :
and I will purge out from among you the rebels , and them that transgress against me : I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn , and they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
as for you , O house of Israel , thus saith the Lord God ; Go ye , serve ye every one his idols , and hereafter also , if ye will not hearken unto me : but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols .
for in mine holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of Israel , saith the Lord God , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them in the land , serve me : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offerings , and the firstfruits of your oblations , with all your holy things .
I will accept you with your sweet savour , when I bring you out from the people , and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered ; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers .
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your doings , wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have wrought with you for my name 's sake , not according to your wicked ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , O ye house of Israel , saith the Lord God .
and he hath give it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the Slayer .
also , thou son of man , appoint thee two ways , that the sword of the king of Babylon may come : both twain shall come forth out of one land : and choose thou a place , choose it at the head of the way to the city .
and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight , to them that have sworn oaths : but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be taken .
shall I cause it to return into his sheath ? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of THY nativity .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to destroy .
in thee have they set light by father and mother : in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger : in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof , like a roaring lion ravening the prey ; they have devoured souls ; they have taken the treasure and precious things ; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof .
and they committed whoredoms in Egypt ; they committed whoredoms in their youth : there were their breasts pressed , and there they bruised the teats of their virginity .
thus she committed her whoredoms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria , and with all on whom she doted : with all their idols she defiled herself .
neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her .
yet she multiplied her whoredoms , in calling to remembrance the days of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
thus will I make THY lewdness to cease from thee , and THY whoredom brought from the land of Egypt : so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them , nor remember Egypt any more .
for thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest , into the hand of them from whom THY mind is alienated :
Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt break the sherds thereof , and pluck off thine own breasts : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
that they have committed adultery , and blood is in their hands , and with their idols have they committed adultery , and have also caused their sons , whom they bare unto me , to pass for them through the fire , to devour them .
and furthermore , that ye have sent for men to come from far , unto whom a messenger was sent ; and , lo , they came : for whom thou didst wash thyself , paintedst THY eyes , and deckedst thyself with ornaments ,
yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot : so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah , the lewd women .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall slay their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
Wherefore thus saith the Lord God ; Woe to the bloody city , to the pot whose scum is therein , and whose scum is not gone out of it ! bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall up on it .
then set it empty upon the coals thereof , that the brass of it may be hot , and may burn , and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it , that the scum of it may be consumed .
in THY filthiness is lewdness : because I have purged thee , and thou wast not purged , thou shalt not be purged from THY filthiness any more , till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee .
behold , therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their palaces in thee , and make their dwellings in thee : they shall eat THY fruit , and they shall drink THY milk .
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth @-@ jeshimoth , Baal @-@ meon , and Kiriathaim ,
and I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel : and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury ; and they shall know my vengeance , saith the Lord God .
and it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
it shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord God : and it shall become a spoil to the nations .
for thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , a king of kings , from the north , with horses , and with chariots , and with horsemen , and companies , and much people .
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all THY streets : he shall slay THY people by the sword , and THY strong garrisons shall go down to the ground .
and they shall make a spoil of THY riches , and make a prey of THY merchandise : and they shall break down THY walls , and destroy THY pleasant houses : and they shall lay THY stones and THY timber and THY dust in the midst of the water .
then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones , and lay away their robes , and put off their broidered garments : they shall clothe themselves with trembling ; they shall sit upon the ground , and shall tremble at every moment , and be astonished at thee .
and say unto Tyrus , O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea , which art a merchant of the people for many isles , Thus saith the Lord God ; O Tyrus , thou hast said , I am of perfect beauty .
of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars ; the company of the Ashurites have made THY benches of Ivory , brought out of the isles of Chittim .
the men of Arvad with thine army were upon THY walls round about , and the Gammadims were in THY towers : they hanged their shields upon THY walls round about ; they have made THY beauty perfect .
these were THY merchants in all sorts of things , in blue clothes , and broidered work , and in chests of rich apparel , bound with cords , and made of cedar , among THY merchandise .
the ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in THY market : and thou wast replenished , and made very glorious in the midst of the seas .
and all that handle the oar , the mariners , and all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships , they shall stand upon the land ;
and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust upon their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
when THY wares went forth out of the seas , thou filledst many people ; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of THY riches and of THY merchandise .
behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of THY wisdom , and they shall defile THY brightness .
Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and I have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
Thine heart was lifted up because of THY beauty , thou hast corrupted THY wisdom by reason of THY brightness : I will cast thee to the ground , I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
thus saith the Lord God ; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered , and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen , then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob .
but I will put hooks in THY jaws , and I will cause the fish of THY rivers to stick unto THY scales , and I will bring thee up out of the midst of THY rivers , and all the fish of THY rivers shall stick unto THY scales .
and I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness , thee and all the fish of THY rivers : thou shalt fall upon the open fields ; thou shalt not be brought together , nor gathered : I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven .
when they took hold of thee by THY hand , thou didst break , and rend all their shoulder : and when they leaned upon thee , thou brakest , and madest all their loins to be at a stand .
behold , therefore I am against thee , and against THY rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate , from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia .
and I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years : and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
and I will bring again the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their habitation ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the basest of the kingdoms ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall take her multitude , and take her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
in that day will I cause the Horn of the house of Israel to bud forth , and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
Ethiopia , and Libya , and Lydia , and all the mingled people , and Chub , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the sword .
and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
and I will make the rivers dry , and sell the land into the hand of the wicked : and I will make the land waste , and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers : I the Lord have spoken it .
thus saith the Lord God ; I will also destroy the idols , and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph ; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
at Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened , when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt : and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her : as for her , a cloud shall cover her , and her daughters shall go into captivity .
and it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and , lo , it shall not be bound up to be healed , to put a roller to bind it , to make it strong to hold the sword .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
and I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but I will break Pharaoh 's arms , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field , and his boughs were multiplied , and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters , when he shot forth .
all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow dwelt all great nations .
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen ; he shall surely deal with him : I have driven him out for his wickedness .
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen .
and it came to pass in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
then will I leave thee upon the land , I will cast thee forth upon the open field , and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee , and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee .
I will also water with THY blood the land wherein thou swimmest , even to the mountains ; and the rivers shall be full of thee .
and when I shall put thee out , I will cover the heaven , and make the stars thereof dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give her light .
by the swords of the mighty will I cause THY multitude to fall , the terrible of the nations , all of them : and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt , and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full , when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the Lord .
it came to pass also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , unto the nether parts of the earth , with them that go down into the pit .
whose graves are set in the sides of the pit , and her company is round about her grave : all of them slain , fallen by the sword , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Meshech , Tubal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is Edom , her kings , and all her princes , which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with them that go down to the pit .
for I have caused my terror in the land of the living : and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword , even Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord God .
son of man , speak to the children of THY people , and say unto them , When I bring the sword upon a land , if the people of the land take a man of their coasts , and set him for their watchman :
so thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered THY soul .
and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me , saying , The city is smitten .
and , lo , thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument : for they hear THY words , but they do them not .
as I live , saith the Lord God , surely because my flock became a prey , and my flock became meat to every beast of the field , because there was no shepherd , neither did my shepherds search for my flock , but the shepherds fed themselves , and fed not my flock ;
and I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
I will seek that which was lost , and bring again that which was driven away , and will bind up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was sick : but I will destroy the fat and the strong ; I will feed them with judgment .
Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture , but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures ? and to have drunk of the deep waters , but ye must foul the residue with your feet ?
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
and I will make with them a Covenant of peace , and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land : and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
and I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen , neither shall the beast of the land devour them ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make them afraid .
and I will raise up for them a plant of renown , and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land , neither bear the shame of the heathen any more .
because thou hast had a perpetual hatred , and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time that their iniquity had an end :
and I will fill his mountains with his slain men : in THY hills , and in THY valleys , and in all THY rivers , shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
and thou shalt know that I am the Lord , and that I have heard all THY blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they are given us to consume .
Yea , I will cause men to walk upon you , even my people Israel ; and they shall possess thee , and thou shalt be their inheritance , and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men .
neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more , neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause THY nations to fall any more , saith the Lord God .
then will I sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
a new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you an heart of flesh .
and I will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and ye shall keep my judgments , and do them .
then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
thus saith the Lord God ; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be builded .
the hand of the Lord was upon me , and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord , and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones ,
therefore prophesy and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; behold , O my people , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of Israel .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
moreover , thou son of man , take thee one stick , and write upon it , For Judah , and for the children of Israel his companions : then take another stick , and write upon it , For Joseph , the stick of Ephraim , and for all the house of Israel his companions :
and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen , whither they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all : and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all :
neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols , nor with their detestable things , nor with any of their transgressions : but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces , wherein they have sinned , and will cleanse them : so shall they be my people , and I will be their God .
and they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant , wherein your fathers have dwelt ; and they shall dwell therein , even they , and their children , and their children 's children for ever : and my servant David shall be their prince for ever .
and thou shalt come from THY place out of the north parts , thou , and many people with thee , all of them riding upon horses , a great company , and a mighty army :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , saith the Lord God , that my fury shall come up in my face .
and I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood ; and I will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many people that are with him , an overflowing rain , and great hailstones , fire , and brimstone .
and I will turn thee back , and leave but the sixth part of thee , and will cause thee to come up from the north parts , and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel :
Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel , thou , and all THY bands , and the people that is with thee : I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort , and to the beasts of the field to be devoured .
so will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel ; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more : and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord , the Holy One in Israel .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall burn the weapons with fire : and they shall spoil those that spoiled them , and rob those that robbed them , saith the Lord God .
and the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity : because they trespassed against me , therefore hid I my face from them , and gave them into the hand of their enemies : so fell they all by the sword .
then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , which cause them to be led into captivity among the heathen : but I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten , in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon me , and brought me thither .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me upon a very high mountain , by which was as the frame of a city on the south .
and he brought me thither , and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring Reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east , and went up the stairs thereof , and measured the threshold of the gate , which was one Reed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one Reed broad .
the space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side , and the space was one cubit on that side : and the little chambers were six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
and the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side ; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate : the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
and their windows , and their arches , and their palm trees , were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east ; and they went up unto it by seven steps ; and the arches thereof were before them .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
and the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
and the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , were according to these measures : and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
and the arches thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and at the side without , as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
and without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi , which come near to the Lord to minister unto him .
and he brought me to the porch of the house , and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
afterward he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tabernacle .
and the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about , and the length thereof ninety cubits .
and he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it , and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side , an hundred cubits , with the inner temple , and the porches of the court ;
the door posts , and the narrow windows , and the galleries round about on their three stories , over against the door , cieled with wood round about , and from the ground up to the windows , and the windows were covered ;
so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
the altar of wood was three cubits high , and the length thereof two cubits ; and the corners thereof , and the length thereof , and the walls thereof , were of wood : and he said unto me , This is the table that is before the Lord .
and the doors had two leaves apiece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick planks .
then he brought me forth into the utter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place , and which was before the building toward the north .
over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court , and over against the pavement which was for the utter court , was gallery against gallery in three stories .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth shined with his glory .
and it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city : and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell upon my face .
now let them put away their whoredom , and the carcases of their kings , far from me , and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
and the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof ; and the border about it shall be half a cubit ; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about ; and his stairs shall look toward the east .
and thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok , which approach unto me , to minister unto me , saith the Lord God , a young bullock for a sin offering .
and thou shalt take of the blood thereof , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the settle , and upon the border round about : thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it .
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
and thou shalt offer them before the Lord , and the priests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the Lord .
it is for the prince ; the prince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord : and I fell upon my face .
in that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers , uncircumcised in heart , and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in my sanctuary , to pollute it , even my house , when ye offer my bread , the fat and the blood , and they have broken my Covenant because of all your abominations .
and they shall not come near unto me , to do the office of a priest unto me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , in the most holy place : but they shall bear their shame , and their abominations which they have committed .
and it shall come to pass , that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linen garments ; and no wool shall come upon them , whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court , and within .
neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her that is put away : but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow that had a priest before .
and they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves : but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister that hath had no husband , they may defile themselves .
and the first of all the firstfruits of all things , and every oblation of all , of every sort of your oblations , shall be the priest 's : ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough , that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house .
moreover , when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance , ye shall offer an oblation unto the Lord , an holy portion of the land : the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds , and the breadth shall be ten thousand . this shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about .
the holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary , which shall come near to minister unto the Lord : and it shall be a place for their houses , and an holy place for the sanctuary .
concerning the ordinance of oil , the bath of oil , ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the Cor , which is an Homer of ten baths ; for ten baths are an Homer :
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it upon the posts of the house , and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar , and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court .
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord , seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days ; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering .
in the seventh month , in the fifteenth day of the month , shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days , according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meat offering , and according to the oil .
thus saith the Lord God ; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the sabbath it shall be opened , and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram : they shall be without blemish .
and when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way thereof .
moreover the prince shall not take of the people 's inheritance by oppression , to thrust them out of their possession ; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession : that my people be not scattered every man from his possession .
after he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy chambers of the priests , which looked toward the north : and , behold , there was a place on the two sides westward .
then he brought me forth into the utter court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and , behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward , and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward ; and , behold , there ran out waters on the right side .
and it shall come to pass , that the fishers shall stand upon it from En @-@ gedi even unto En @-@ eglaim ; they shall be a place to spread forth nets ; their fish shall be according to their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
and these shall be the measures thereof ; the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
and the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty , and toward the south two hundred and fifty , and toward the east two hundred and fifty , and toward the west two hundred and fifty .
and the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward , and ten thousand westward : and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion ; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city .
moreover from the possession of the Levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the prince .
and the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God : which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god ; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he drank : so nourishing them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names : for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , of Shadrach ; and to Mishael , of Meshach ; and to Azariah , of Abed @-@ nego .
then let our countenances be looked upon before thee , and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as thou seest , deal with THY servants .
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the astrologers , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , for to shew the king his dreams . so they came and stood before the king .
and it is a rare thing that the king requireth , and there is none other that can shew it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
I thank thee , and praise thee , O thou God of my fathers , who hast given me wisdom and might , and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee : for thou hast now made known unto us the king 's matter .
therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch , whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon : he went and said thus unto him ; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon : bring me in before the king , and I will shew unto the king the interpretation .
then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him , I have found a man of the captives of Judah , that will make known unto the king the interpretation .
Daniel answered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men , the astrologers , the magicians , the soothsayers , shew unto the king ;
but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets , and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . THY dream , and the visions of THY head upon THY bed , are these ;
as for thee , O king , THY thoughts came into THY mind upon THY bed , what should come to pass hereafter : and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass .
and wheresoever the children of men dwell , the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand , and hath made thee ruler over them all . Thou art this head of gold .
and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things : and as iron that breaketh all these , shall it break in pieces and bruise .
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold , whose height was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof six cubits : he set it up in the plain of Dura , in the province of Babylon .
then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes , the governors , and the captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellers , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
therefore at that time , when all the people heard the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and all kinds of musick , all the people , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego : therefore he spake , and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
the leaves thereof were fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all : the beasts of the field had shadow under it , and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof , and all flesh was fed of it .
he cried aloud , and said thus , Hew down the tree , and cut off his branches , shake off his leaves , and scatter his fruit : let the beasts get away from under it , and the fowls from his branches :
nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven , and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth :
whose leaves were fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all ; under which the beasts of the field dwelt , and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation :
the king spake , and said , Is not this great Babylon , that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from heaven , saying , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to thee it is spoken ; The kingdom is departed from thee .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem ; and the king , and his princes , his wives , and his concubines , drank in them .
in the same hour came forth fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . and the king spake and said unto Daniel , Art thou that Daniel , which art of the children of the captivity of Judah , whom the king my father brought out of Jewry ?
and now the wise men , the astrologers , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known unto me the interpretation thereof : but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing :
then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with scarlet , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made a proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
then answered they and said before the king , That Daniel , which is of the children of the captivity of Judah , regardeth not thee , O king , nor the decree that thou hast signed , but maketh his petition three times a day .
then the king , when he heard these words , was sore displeased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting : neither were instruments of musick brought before him : and his sleep went from him .
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
I make a decree , That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel : for he is the living God , and stedfast for ever , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed , and his dominion shall be even unto the end .
the first was like a lion , and had eagle 's wings : I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked , and it was lifted up from the earth , and made stand upon the feet as a man , and a man 's heart was given to it .
I saw in the night visions , and , behold , one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven , and came to the Ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
and there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all people , nations , and languages , should serve him : his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the first , and he shall subdue three kings .
and I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was at Shushan in the palace , which is in the province of Elam ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of Ulai .
then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
and as I was considering , behold , an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth , and touched not the ground : and the goat had a notable Horn between his eyes .
and he came to the ram that had two horns , which I had there seen standing before the river , and ran unto him in the fury of his power .
Yea , he magnified himself even to the prince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
and it came to pass , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , and sought for the meaning , then , behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
so he came near where I stood : and when he came , I was afraid , and fell upon my face : but he said unto me , understand , O son of man : for at the time of the end shall be the vision .
neither have we hearkened unto THY servants the prophets , which spake in THY name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
as it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil is come upon us : yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God , that we might turn from our iniquities , and understand THY truth .
therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil , and brought it upon us : for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth : for we obeyed not his voice .
and now , O Lord our God , that hast brought THY people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
O my God , incline thine ear , and hear ; open thine eyes , and behold our desolations , and the city which is called by THY name : for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses , but for THY great mercies .
Yea , whiles I was speaking in prayer , even the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening oblation .
and I Daniel alone saw the vision : for the men that were with me saw not the vision ; but a great quaking fell upon them , so that they fled to hide themselves .
therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I in a deep sleep on my face , and my face toward the ground .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , straightway there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
and the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate , which shall come with an army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prevail :
and shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods , with their princes , and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north .
and the king of the south shall be moved with choler , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north : and he shall set forth a great multitude ; but the multitude shall be given into his hand .
after this shall he turn his face unto the isles , and shall take many : but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him .
and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him , and shall be broken ; yea , also the prince of the Covenant .
for the ships of Chittim shall come against him : therefore he shall be grieved , and return , and have indignation against the holy Covenant : so shall he do ; he shall even return , and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy Covenant .
and arms shall stand on his part , and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength , and shall take away the daily sacrifice , and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt : and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the abomination that maketh desolate set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days .
the word of the Lord that came unto Hosea , the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
but I will have mercy upon the house of Judah , and will save them by the Lord their God , and will not save them by bow , nor by sword , nor by battle , by horses , nor by horsemen .
yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea , which cannot be measured nor numbered ; and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said unto them , Ye are not my people , there it shall be said unto them , Ye are the sons of the living God .
then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of Jezreel .
Lest I strip her naked , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and slay her with thirst .
therefore will I return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness .
and I will destroy her vines and her fig trees , whereof she hath said , These are my rewards that my lovers have given me : and I will make them a forest , and the beasts of the field shall eat them .
and I will visit upon her the days of Baalim , wherein she burned incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgat me , saith the Lord .
and I will give her her vineyards from thence , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a prince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ephod , and without teraphim :
therefore shall the land mourn , and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish , with the beasts of the field , and with the fowls of heaven ; yea , the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away .
for they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit whoredom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the Lord .
my people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff declareth unto them : for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err , and they have gone a whoring from under their God .
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom , nor your spouses when they commit adultery : for themselves are separated with whores , and they sacrifice with harlots : therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall .
they will not frame their doings to turn unto their God : for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them , and they have not known the Lord .
for I will be unto Ephraim as a lion , and as a young lion to the house of Judah : I , even I , will tear and go away ; I will take away , and none shall rescue him .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
for they have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind : it hath no stalk : the bud shall yield no meal : if so be it yield , the strangers shall swallow it up .
for , lo , they are gone because of destruction : Egypt shall gather them up , Memphis shall bury them : the pleasant places for their silver , nettles shall possess them : thorns shall be in their tabernacles .
I drew them with cords of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws , and I laid meat unto them .
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger , I will not return to destroy Ephraim : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the midst of thee : and I will not enter into the city .
they shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a dove out of the land of Assyria : and I will place them in their houses , saith the Lord .
therefore they shall be as the morning cloud , and as the early dew that passeth away , as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the chimney .
the sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him : he is an unwise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
though he be fruitful among his brethren , an east wind shall come , the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness , and his spring shall become dry , and his fountain shall be dried up : he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels .
who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? prudent , and he shall know them ? for the ways of the Lord are right , and the just shall walk in them : but the transgressors shall fall therein .
the vine is dried up , and the fig tree languisheth ; the pomegranate tree , the palm tree also , and the apple tree , even all the trees of the field , are withered : because joy is withered away from the sons of men .
O Lord , to thee will I cry : for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field .
they shall run like mighty men ; they shall climb the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks :
they shall run to and fro in the city ; they shall run upon the wall , they shall climb up upon the houses ; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief .
and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army : for his camp is very great : for he is strong that executeth his word : for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible ; and who can abide it ?
and rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the Lord your God : for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth him of the evil .
Yea , the Lord will answer and say unto his people , behold , I will send you corn , and wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied therewith : and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen :
be not afraid , ye beasts of the field : for the pastures of the wilderness do spring , for the tree beareth her fruit , the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the Lord your God , that hath dealt wondrously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and it shall come to pass afterward , that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions :
I will also gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat , and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations , and parted my land .
Yea , and what have ye to do with me , O Tyre , and Zidon , and all the coasts of Palestine ? will ye render me a recompence ? and if ye recompence me , swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head ;
the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians , that ye might remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah , and they shall sell them to the Sabeans , to a people far off : for the Lord hath spoken it .
the Lord also shall roar out of Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake : but the Lord will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the mountains shall drop down new wine , and the hills shall flow with milk , and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters , and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord , and shall water the valley of Shittim .
I will break also the bar of Damascus , and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven , and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden : and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir , saith the Lord .
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead , that they might enlarge their border :
but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it shall devour the palaces thereof , with shouting in the day of battle , with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind :
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Judah , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have despised the law of the Lord , and have not kept his commandments , and their lies caused them to err , after the which their fathers have walked :
that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the meek : and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid , to profane my holy name :
neither shall he stand that handleth the bow ; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself .
can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth , where no gin is for him ? shall one take up a snare from the earth , and have taken nothing at all ?
publish in the palaces at Ashdod , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria , and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof , and the oppressed in the midst thereof .
that in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel : and the horns of the altar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her ; and ye shall cast them into the palace , saith the Lord .
and also I have withholden the rain from you , when there were yet three months to the harvest : and I caused it to rain upon one city , and caused it not to rain upon another city : one piece was rained upon , and the piece whereupon it rained not withered .
Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor , and ye take from him burdens of wheat : ye have built houses of hewn stone , but ye shall not dwell in them ; ye have planted pleasant vineyards , but ye shall not drink wine of them .
that lie upon beds of Ivory , and stretch themselves upon their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me ; and , behold , he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and , lo , it was the latter growth after the king 's mowings .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the Lord God , that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will darken the earth in the clear day :
and they shall wander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east , they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord , and shall not find it .
and though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel , I will search and take them out thence ; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea , thence will I command the serpent , and he shall bite them :
it is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven , and hath founded his troop in the earth ; he that calleth for the waters of the sea , and poureth them out upon the face of the earth : the Lord is his name .
for , lo , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is sifted in a sieve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
in that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen , and close up the breaches thereof ; and I will raise up his ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old :
and I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
but thou shouldest not have looked on the day of THY brother in the day that he became a stranger ; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction ; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress .
Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity ; yea , thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity , nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity ;
neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway , to cut off those of his that did escape ; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress .
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the heathen drink continually , yea , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
and the house of Jacob shall be a fire , and the house of Joseph a flame , and the house of Esau for stubble , and they shall kindle in them , and devour them ; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau ; for the Lord hath spoken it .
for thou hadst cast me into the deep , in the midst of the seas ; and the floods compassed me about : all THY billows and THY waves passed over me .
so the people of Nineveh believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
for word came unto the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and he laid his robe from him , and covered him with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto God : yea , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
and God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God repented of the evil , that he had said that he would do unto them ; and he did it not .
so Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city .
and the Lord God prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
Woe to them that devise iniquity , and work evil upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practise it , because it is in the power of their hand .
and they covet fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
the breaker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord on the head of them .
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then shall they cry unto the Lord , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings .
thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err , that bite with their teeth , and cry , Peace ; and he that putteth not into their mouths , they even prepare war against him .
therefore night shall be unto you , that ye shall not have a vision ; and it shall be dark unto you , that ye shall not divine ; and the sun shall go down over the prophets , and the day shall be dark over them .
but in the last days it shall come to pass , that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains , and it shall be exalted above the hills ; and people shall flow unto it .
for all people will walk every one in the name of his god , and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever .
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord , in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth .
and this man shall be the peace , when the Assyrian shall come into our land : and when he shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shepherds , and eight principal men .
and they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof : thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian , when he cometh into our land , and when he treadeth within our borders .
THY Graven images also will I cut off , and THY standing images out of the midst of thee ; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands .
hear ye , O mountains , the Lord 's controversy , and ye strong foundations of the earth : for the Lord hath a controversy with his people , and he will plead with Israel .
Thou shalt eat , but not be satisfied ; and THY casting down shall be in the midst of thee ; and thou shalt take hold , but shalt not deliver ; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword .
Thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olives , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .
for the son dishonoureth the father , the daughter riseth up against her mother , the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a man 's enemies are the men of his own house .
I will bear the indignation of the Lord , because I have sinned against him , until he plead my cause , and execute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall behold his righteousness .
he will turn again , he will have compassion upon us ; he will subdue our iniquities ; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
the Lord is slow to anger , and great in power , and will not at all acquit the wicked : the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
the shield of his mighty men is made red , the valiant men are in scarlet : the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation , and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken .
where is the dwelling of the lions , and the feedingplace of the young lions , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion 's whelp , and none made them afraid ?
the Horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear : and there is a multitude of slain , and a great number of carcases ; and there is none end of their corpses ; they stumble upon their corpses :
yet was she carried away , she went into captivity : her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her honourable men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
THY crowned are as the locusts , and THY captains as the great grasshoppers , which camp in the hedges in the cold day , but when the sun ariseth they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
for , lo , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land , to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs .
their horses also are swifter than the leopards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves : and their horsemen shall spread themselves , and their horsemen shall come from far ; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat .
Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil , and canst not look on iniquity : wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously , and holdest THY tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he ?
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the tower , and will watch to see what he will say unto me , and what I shall answer when I am reproved .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tarry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tarry .
because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the power of evil !
THY bow was made quite naked , according to the oaths of the tribes , even THY word . Selah . Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers .
Thou wentest forth for the salvation of THY people , even for salvation with thine anointed ; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked , by discovering the foundation unto the neck . Selah .
the word of the Lord which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hizkiah , in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah .
hold THY peace at the presence of the Lord God : for the day of the Lord is at hand : for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice , he hath bid his guests .
therefore their goods shall become a booty , and their houses a desolation : they shall also build houses , but not inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , but not drink the wine thereof .
the Lord will be terrible unto them : for he will famish all the gods of the earth ; and men shall worship him , every one from his place , even all the isles of the heathen .
in that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all THY doings , wherein thou hast transgressed against me : for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in THY pride , and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain .
the remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth : for they shall feed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the Lord hath taken away THY judgments , he hath cast out thine enemy : the king of Israel , even the Lord , is in the midst of thee : thou shalt not see evil any more .
in the second year of Darius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Josedech , the high priest , saying ,
Ye have sown much , and bring in little ; ye eat , but ye have not enough ; ye drink , but ye are not filled with drink ; ye clothe you , but there is none warm ; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes .
and I called for a drought upon the land , and upon the mountains , and upon the corn , and upon the new wine , and upon the oil , and upon that which the ground bringeth forth , and upon men , and upon cattle , and upon all the labour of the hands .
then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Joshua the son of Josedech , the high priest , with all the remnant of the people , obeyed the voice of the Lord their God , and the words of Haggai the prophet , as the Lord their God had sent him , and the people did fear before the Lord .
in the seventh month , in the one and twentieth day of the month , came the word of the Lord by the prophet Haggai , saying ,
speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Josedech , the high priest , and to the residue of the people , saying ,
consider now from this day and upward , from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , even from the day that the foundation of the Lord 's temple was laid , consider it .
and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms , and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen ; and I will overthrow the chariots , and those that ride in them ; and the horses and their riders shall come down , every one by the sword of his brother .
in the eighth month , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah , the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo the prophet , saying ,
upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month , which is the month Sebat , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah , the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo the prophet , saying ,
I saw by night , and behold a man riding upon a red horse , and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom ; and behind him were there red horses , speckled , and white .
and they answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the myrtle trees , and said , We have walked to and fro through the earth , and , behold , all the earth sitteth still , and is at rest .
and many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him , saying , Take away the filthy garments from him . and unto him he said , behold , I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee , and I will clothe thee with change of raiment .
and , behold , there was lifted up a talent of lead : and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah .
then lifted I up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their wings ; for they had wings like the wings of a stork : and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven .
and I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came four chariots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of brass .
and the bay went forth , and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth : and he said , Get you hence , walk to and fro through the earth . so they walked to and fro through the earth .
take of them of the captivity , even of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah , which are come from Babylon , and come thou the same day , and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah ;
and speak unto him , saying , Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , saying , behold the man whose name is The branch ; and he shall grow up out of his place , and he shall build the temple of the Lord :
even he shall build the temple of the Lord ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon his throne ; and he shall be a priest upon his throne : and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
and the crowns shall be to Helem , and to Tobijah , and to Jedaiah , and to Hen the son of Zephaniah , for a memorial in the temple of the Lord .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius , that the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month , even in Chisleu ;
speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month , even those seventy years , did ye at all fast unto me , even to me ?
and when ye did eat , and when ye did drink , did not ye eat for yourselves , and drink for yourselves ?
thus saith the Lord ; I am returned unto Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the Lord of hosts the holy mountain .
for before these days there was no hire for man , nor any hire for beast ; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction : for I set all men every one against his neighbour .
for the seed shall be prosperous ; the vine shall give her fruit , and the ground shall give her increase , and the heavens shall give their dew ; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things .
the burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach , and Damascus shall be the rest thereof : when the eyes of man , as of all the tribes of Israel , shall be toward the Lord .
Ashkelon shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sorrowful , and Ekron ; for her expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited .
and I will encamp about mine house because of the army , because of him that passeth by , and because of him that returneth : and no oppressor shall pass through them any more : for now have I seen with mine eyes .
and the Lord shall be seen over them , and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning : and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet , and shall go with whirlwinds of the south .
and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a crown , lifted up as an ensign upon his land .
ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain ; so the Lord shall make bright clouds , and give them showers of rain , to every one grass in the field .
and they shall be as mighty men , which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the Lord is with them , and the riders on horses shall be confounded .
and I will strengthen the house of Judah , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them again to place them ; for I have mercy upon them : and they shall be as though I had not cast them off : for I am the Lord their God , and will hear them .
and they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine : yea , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall rejoice in the Lord .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Labanon ; and place shall not be found for them .
and he shall pass through the sea with affliction , and shall smite the waves in the sea , and all the deeps of the river shall dry up : and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down , and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away .
then said I , I will not feed you : that that dieth , let it die ; and that that is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another .
and the Lord said unto me , cast it unto the Potter : a goodly price that I was prised at of them . and I took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the Potter in the house of the Lord .
in that day , saith the Lord , I will smite every horse with astonishment , and his Rider with madness : and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah , and will smite every horse of the people with blindness .
in that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David ; and the house of David shall be as God , as the angel of the Lord before them .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the Lord of hosts , that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land , and they shall no more be remembered : and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision , when he hath prophesied ; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive :
for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses rifled , and the women ravished ; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity , and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hinder sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem ; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet , and their eyes shall consume away in their holes , and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a great tumult from the Lord shall be among them ; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour , and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour .
and so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the Camel , and of the ass , and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents , as this plague .
and it shall come to pass , that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , and to keep the feast of tabernacles .
and it shall be , that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , even upon them shall be no rain .
but ye have profaned it , in that ye say , The table of the Lord is polluted ; and the fruit thereof , even his meat , is contemptible .
behold , I will send my messenger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the Lord , whom ye seek , shall suddenly come to this temple , even the messenger of the Covenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , saith the Lord of hosts .
and he shall sit as a refiner and purifer of silver : and he shall purify the sons of Levi , and purge them as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness .
and I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes , and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground ; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field , saith the Lord of hosts .
then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another : and the Lord hearkened , and heard it , and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord , and that thought upon his name .
when they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
and when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense , and myrrh .
but when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither : notwithstanding , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Galilee :

Jesus answered , He it is , to whom I shall give a Sop , when I have dipped it . and when he had dipped the Sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
but the Comforter , which is the Holy ghost , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said unto you .
peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and come again unto you . if ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I said , I go unto the Father : for my Father is greater than I.
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
henceforth I call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you .
remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . if they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
but when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the Father , he shall testify of me :
but these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . and these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .
Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
Verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
for I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
and now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
father , I will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
when Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the Lord . now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his Fisher 's coat unto him , ( for he was naked , ) and did cast himself into the sea .
and the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
Verily , verily , I say unto thee , When thou wast young , thou girdedst thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth THY hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not .
and there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . Amen .
and , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , saith he , ye have heard of me .
but ye shall receive power , after that the Holy ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem , and in all Judaea , and in Samaria , and unto the uttermost part of the earth .
and when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where abode both Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bartholomew , and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon Zelotes , and Judas the brother of James .
and it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem ; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue , Aceldama , that is to say , The field of blood .
therefore being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne ;
and Annas the high priest , and Caiaphas , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest , were gathered together at Jerusalem .
and when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , thou art God , which hast made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is :
and when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the Apostles , and beaten them , they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
I have seen , I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt , and I have heard their groaning , and am come down to deliver them . and now come , I will send thee into Egypt .
this is that Moses , which said unto the children of Israel , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear .
for unclean spirits , crying with loud voice , came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with palsies , and that were lame , were healed .
and he trembling and astonished said , Lord , what wilt thou have me to do ? and the Lord said unto him , arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
and when Saul was come to Jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a disciple .
and it came to pass in those days , that she was sick , and died : whom when they had washed , they laid her in an upper chamber .
and saw heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending unto him , as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners , and let down to the earth :
now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
send therefore to Joppa , and call hither Simon , whose surname is Peter ; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side : who , when he cometh , shall speak unto thee .
then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem : and they sent forth Barnabas , that he should go as far as Antioch .
now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas , and Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
for they that dwell at Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they knew him not , nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day , they have fulfilled them in condemning him .
Forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
then came he to Derbe and Lystra : and , behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timotheus , the son of a certain woman , which was a Jewess , and believed ; but his father was a Greek :
and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , supposing that the prisoners had been fled .
for as I passed by , and beheld your devotions , I found an altar with this inscription , TO the unknown God . whom therefore ye ignorantly worship , him declare I unto you .
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation ;
because he hath appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men , in that he hath raised him from the dead .
but bade them farewell , saying , I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem : but I will return again unto you , if God will . and he sailed from Ephesus .
and the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul 's companions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
and we sailed thence , and came the next day over against Chios ; and the next day we arrived at Samos , and tarried at Trogyllium ; and the next day we came to Miletus .
for Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
and it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a straight course unto Coos , and the day following unto Rhodes , and from thence unto Patara :
now when we had discovered Cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sailed into Syria , and landed at Tyre : for there the ship was to unlade her burden .
and when we had accomplished those days , we departed and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way , with wives and children , till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down on the shore , and prayed .
and the next day we that were of Paul 's company departed , and came unto Caesarea : and we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist , which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
and when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
and it came to pass , that , as I made my journey , and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon , suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
and when there arose a great dissension , the chief captain , fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , commanded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
and when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man , I sent straightway to thee , and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him . farewell .
then Paul , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , answered , Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheerfully answer for myself :
and when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
and on the morrow , when Agrippa was come , and Bernice , with great pomp , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief captains , and principal men of the city , at Festus ' commandment Paul was brought forth .
which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
but rise , and stand upon THY feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;
and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship ,
and when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
and when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
and when they had taken up the anchors , they committed themselves unto the sea , and loosed the rudder bands , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind , and made toward shore .
and falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .
and it came to pass , that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
and when we came to Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
for the heart of this people is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ;
for when the Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves :
now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
for the promise , that he should be the heir of the world , was not to Abraham , or to his seed , through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the deadness of Sara 's womb :
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
know ye not , brethren , ( for I speak to them that know the law , ) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth ?
for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth ; but if the husband be dead , she is loosed from the law of her husband .
for I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh , ) dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit .
but ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
but if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
who is he that condemneth ? it is Christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
and if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . but if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be graffed into their own olive tree ?
for I would not , brethren , that ye should be ignorant of this mystery , lest ye should be wise in your own conceits ; that blindness in part is happened to Israel , until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in .
he that regardeth the day , regardeth it unto the Lord ; and he that regardeth not the day , to the Lord he doth not regard it . he that eateth , eateth to the Lord , for he giveth God thanks ; and he that eateth not , to the Lord he eateth not , and giveth God thanks .
for whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
and I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Jesus Christ 's sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ;
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for it hath been declared unto me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
and base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are :
now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
every man 's work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
for who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
I speak to your shame . is it so , that there is not a wise man among you ? no , not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren ?
and such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sinneth not : let them marry .
nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
but meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
what is my reward then ? Verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
but I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway .
moreover , brethren , I would not that ye should be ignorant , how that all our fathers were under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
the cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
but if any man say unto you , This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof :
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
when I was a child , I spake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
I would that ye all spake with tongues , but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
what is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
as touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints which are in all Achaia :
who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
and whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
and I wrote this same unto you , lest , when I came , I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
for out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears ; not that ye should be grieved , but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you .
Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
and not as Moses , which put a vail over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
for we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
( for he saith , I have heard thee in a time accepted , and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee : behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation . )
Wherefore , though I wrote unto you , I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered wrong , but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you .
for if I have boasted any thing to him of you , I am not ashamed ; but as we spake all things to you in truth , even so our boasting , which I made before Titus , is found a truth .
now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
whether any do inquire of Titus , he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you : or our brethren be inquired of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of Christ .
do ye look on things after the outward appearance ? if any man trust to himself that he is Christ 's , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Christ 's , even so are we Christ 's .
let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are absent , such will we be also in deed when we are present .
not boasting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's labours ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly ,
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
for ye suffer , if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take of you , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face .
in journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ;
for though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me .
and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a Thorn in the flesh , the messenger of Satan to buffet me , lest I should be exalted above measure .
but of these who seemed to be somewhat , ( whatsoever they were , it maketh no matter to me : God accepteth no man 's person : ) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me :
and this I say , that the Covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , cannot disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
where is then the blessedness ye spake of ? for I bear you record , that , if it had been possible , ye would have plucked out your own eyes , and have given them to me .
that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ , both which are in heaven , and which are on earth ; even in him :
in whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise ,
that at that time ye were without Christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
till we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ :
that we henceforth be no more children , tossed to and fro , and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the sleight of men , and cunning craftiness , whereby they lie in wait to deceive ;
from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
finally , brethren , whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report ; if there be any virtue , and if there be any praise , think on these things .
for this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ;
and , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconcile all things unto himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in earth , or things in heaven .
Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ : grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
for our gospel came not unto you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy ghost , and in much assurance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to God @-@ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
nor of men sought we glory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been burdensome , as the Apostles of Christ .
now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher , and an Apostle , ( I speak the truth in Christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity .
( for if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ , nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine , whereunto thou hast attained .
for this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . for in that he put all in subjection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren , that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
for the word of God is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
and verily they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out of the loins of Abraham :
( for those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : )
for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
and they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ;
for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
by faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
and truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
by faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
( for they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart :
be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines . for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with meats , which have not profited them that have been occupied therein .
and the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity : so is the tongue among our members , that it defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
speak not evil one of another , brethren . he that speaketh evil of his brother , and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
behold , the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , crieth : and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth .
be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
take , my brethren , the prophets , who have spoken in the name of the Lord , for an example of suffering affliction , and of patience .
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
for what glory is it , if , when ye be buffeted for your faults , ye shall take it patiently ? but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
but let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not corruptible , even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
if ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
for when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error .
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
but the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;
I write unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome the wicked one . I write unto you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
they went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us .
let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the Father .
and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
we are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us . Hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
if a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
these things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks . the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
I know THY works , and THY labour , and THY patience , and how thou canst not bear them which are evil : and thou hast tried them which say they are Apostles , and are not , and hast found them liars :
remember therefore from whence thou art fallen , and repent , and do the first works ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will remove THY candlestick out of his place , except thou repent .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God .
I know THY works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
and unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write ; These things saith the Son of God , who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire , and his feet are like fine brass ;
and unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ; These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know THY works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
he that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ;
behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and worship before THY feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
and I beheld , and , lo , in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts , and in the midst of the elders , stood a lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth .
and I beheld , and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
and when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . and I beheld , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
and when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains ;
and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
and I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
and I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
and the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before God out of the angel 's hand .
and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
and the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ;
and he opened the bottomless pit ; and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
and they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
and thus I saw the horses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having breastplates of fire , and of jacinth , and brimstone : and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone .
for their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto Serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven , clothed with a cloud : and a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire :
and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again , and said , Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
and I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
but the court which is without the temple leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given unto the Gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand : and the remnant were affrighted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
and I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
and the beast which I saw was like unto a Leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name .
and another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , thrust in THY sickle , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe .
and I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the beast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having the harps of God .
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
for they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
and the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in remembrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication , and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
and the kings of the earth , who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her , shall bewail her , and lament for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee : for THY merchants were the great men of the earth ; for by THY sorceries were all nations deceived .
for true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand .
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
and they went up on the breadth of the earth , and compassed the camp of the saints about , and the beloved city : and fire came down from God out of heaven , and devoured them .
and I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God ; and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
and he measured the wall thereof , an hundred and forty and four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the angel .
and the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to shine in it : for the glory of God did lighten it , and the lamb is the light thereof .
and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it : and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it .
and I John saw these things , and heard them . and when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things .
he that is unjust , let him be unjust still : and he which is filthy , let him be filthy still : and he that is righteous , let him be righteous still : and he that is holy , let him be holy still .
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the holy city , and from the things which are written in this book .
