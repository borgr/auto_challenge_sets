European agencies working across Europe for you
Some sixteen specialised and decentralised EU agencies have been established to support the EU Member States and their citizens.
The objectives of the individual agencies are many and varied.Each agency is unique and fulfils an individual function.
However, there are a number of general aims underlying an agency’s operation as a whole:
• they introduce a degree of decentralisation and dispersal to the Community’s activities;• they give a higher profile to the tasks that are assigned to them by identifying them with the agencies themselves;• some answer the need to develop scientific or technical know-how in certain well-defined fi elds;• others have the role of integrating different interest groups and thus facilitating dialogue at European (between social partners,for example) or international level.

European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training
:"Cedefop * – the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, established in 1975,is a European agency that helps promote and develop vocational education and training in the European Union (EU).Originally based in Berlin,Cedefop was one of the first specialised and decentralised agencies set up.In 1995,Cedefop’s head office was transferred to Thessaloniki,while it operates a liaison office in Brussels.
Cedefop works to promote a European area of lifelong learning throughout an enlarged EU.
It does this by providing information on and analyses of vocational education and training systems, policies, research and practice.
Established: 1975Director: Johan van Rens Staff: 120
Cedefop’s tasks are to:• compile selected documentation and analyses of data;• contribute to developing and coordinating research;• exploit and disseminate information;• encourage joint approaches to vocational education and training problems;• provide a forum for debate and exchanges of ideas.
Cedefop has set the following medium-term priorities for 2003–06 to guide its activities and the information it provides:• improving access to learning,mobility and social inclusion;• enabling and valuing learning;• supporting networks and partnerships in an enlarged EU.
Cedefop presents its information in electronic and printed media and also brings people together through the study visits,conferences and seminars it organises.
Cedefop’s information is targeted at vocational education and training policy-makers, researchers and practitioners in the EU and beyond.
Cedefop work programmes and the latest annual report are available on the Internet: www.cedefop.eu.int.
Information is also available on the Cedefop staff and management board as well as its organisation.
Cedefop also operates an interactive website called the European Training Village: www.trainingvillage.gr
European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions
:"The Foundation is a European Union body set up in 1975 to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions in Europe.
It provides fi ndings, knowledge and advice from independent and comparative research,to governments, employers, trade unions and the European Commission.
Established: 1975Acting Director: Willy Buschak Staff: 100
The Foundation organises its work around three core areas of expertise,with a focus on the following issues: • working conditions:including work organisation,time issues in the workplace, fl exibility, monitoring of changes in working conditions; • living conditions:issues that affect the everyday lives of Europe’s citi-zens, including the balance between work and family life,the provision of social public services and promoting integration into employment; • industrial relations:industrial change and corporate restructuring, employee participation in decision-making,the Europeanisation of industrial relations.
Foundation research reports can be downloaded free of charge directly from the website or ordered online at www.eurofound.eu.int.
The Foundation has a tripartite Administrative Board,made up of representatives from public authorities (governments and the European Commission), employer organisations and trade unions.
:"The European Environment Agency (EEA) is the EU body dedicated to providing sound and independent information on the environment.
We are a main information source for those involved in developing, adopting, implementing and evaluating environmental policy,as well as the general public.
Our aim is to help the EU and member countries make informed decisions about improving the environment,integrating environmental considerations into economic policies and moving towards sustainability
Established: 1993Executive Director: Prof.Jacqueline McGlade Staff: 115
A major source of information is the European environment information and observation network (Eionet).The EEA is responsible for developing the network and coordinating its activities.To do this,we work closely together with the national focal points,typically national environment agencies or environment ministries in the member countries.They are responsible for coordinating national networks involving about 300 institutions in all.
Enquiries: www.eea.eu.int/help/ infocentre/enquiries Website: www.eea.eu.int
To support data collection,management and analysis we have established and work closely with five European topic centres covering water,air and climate change,nature protection and biodiversity,waste and material fl ows, and terrestrial environment.
Information for improving Europe’s environment
We also work closely together with other European and international institutions such as the Statistical Office (Eurostat) and Joint Research Centre of the European Commission,the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organisation (WHO).
The EEA and Eionet were established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 of 7 May 1990 with later amendments (1999,2003).
The Agency is located in Copenhagen and by 2004 had a staff of approximately 115.
The Agency’s 2004 budget is about EUR 31 million.
Membership is open to countries that are not Member States of the European Union.
We now (2004) have 31 member countries: 25 EU Member States together with Bulgaria, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania and Turkey.
European Training Foundation
Established: 1994Director: Dr Muriel Dunbar Staff: 104
The ETF currently works with 30 partner countries across three continents,including the candidate countries,south-eastern Europe,eastern Europe and central Asia,and the Mediterranean region and carries out the following activities:• assesses progress and future priorities for reform in partner countries in vocational education and training and its links to socioeconomic development;• designs, develops, monitors and assesses projects at the request of the European Commission;• builds capacity so policy-makers and practitioners in partner countries take full part in modernising their vocational education and training systems;• facilitates dialogue amongst stakeholders by developing international, national and local networks.
The ETF also promotes access to European expertise and practices in human resources development in general,and the European employment strategy in particular.It cooperates closely with Cedefop.
As an international centre of expertise,the ETF collaborates with other European and international institutions and organisations such as the World Bank, OECD,the ILO,the European Investment Bank and UNESCO.
:"The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is the hub of drug-related information in the European Union.
Its role is to gather, analyse and disseminate ‘objective, reliable and comparable information’ on drugs and drug addiction and, in so doing, provide its audiences with a sound and evidence-based picture of the drug phenomenon at European level.
Among the Centre’s target groups are policy-makers, who use this information to help formulate coherent national and Community drug strategies.
Also served are professionals and researchers working in the drugs field and, more broadly, the European media and general public.
Established: 1993Director: Georges Estievenart Staff: 80
At the heart of the Centre’s work is the task of improving the comparability of drug information across Europe and devising the methods and tools required to achieve this.
As a result of efforts to date, countries can now view how they fit into the wider European picture and examine common problems and goals.
A key feature of the drug phenomenon is its shifting, dynamic nature, and tracking new developments is a central task of the EMCDDA.
The Centre obtains information primarily from the‘Reitox network’: a group of focal points in each of the 25 EU Member States, Norway, the candidate countries to the EU and at the European Commission.
The Annual report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union and Norway and an online Statistical bulletin offer a yearly overview of the latest European drug situation and trends.
Meanwhile online Country situation summaries provide a rich pool of national drug-related data.
EMCDDA,your reference point on drugs in Europe
The EMCDDA works on the assumption that sound information is the key to an effective strategy on drugs.
Although the Centre cannot propose any kind of policy model, it is now making a clear impact on decision-making through its analyses, instruments and standards.
European Medicines Agency
:"The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) contributes to the protection of public and animal health by ensuring that medicines for human and veterinary use are safe,effective and of high quality.
Bringing together the scientific resources of the 25 EU Member States in a network of more than 40 national competent authorities the EMEA coordinates the evaluation and supervision of medicines throughout the European Union.
It cooperates closely with international partners,reinforcing the EU contribution to global harmonisation.
Established: 1995Director: Thomas Lönngren Staff: 379 (2005)
The EMEA began its activities in 1995,when the European system for authorising medicinal products was introduced providing for a centralised and a mutual recognition procedure.
The EMEA has a role in both,but is primarily involved in the centralised procedure.
Where the centralised procedure is used,companies submit one single marketing authorisation application to the EMEA.A single evaluation is carried out through the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) or Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP).
If the relevant Committee concludes that quality,safety and efficacy of the medicinal product are sufficiently proven,it adopts a positive opinion, which is sent to the Commission to be transformed in a single market authorisation valid for the whole of the European Union.
In 2001, the Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) was established, reviewing designation applications from persons or companies who intend to develop medicines for rare diseases,so-called ‘orphan drugs’.
From the end of 2004 onwards a new Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) will provide scientific opinions on traditional herbal medicines.
The scientific work of the EMEA and its committees is underpinned by a network of 3 500 European experts.
Ten years after its inauguration, the EMEA is implementing new legislation that will significantly broaden the mandate of the Agency.
In addition to a number of organisational changes,Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (which replaces Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93) gives the Agency greater responsibilities,in particular to speed access by patients to new medicines and improve the provision of information to all users of medicines.
Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs)
:"The OHIM is the official authority carrying out the procedures for the Community trade marks since 1996 and for the Community registered design from 2003.These intellectual property rights are valid in all the countries of the EU.
Trade marks and designs belong to the world of private company law.The OHIM is both an agency of the European Community and an industrial property office with its technical function:the registration of industrial property rights.
As a service agency,the Office has to place its clients,that is to say the undertakings that file their trade marks and their designs with the OHIM,at the centre of the overall mechanism of the Office and it has to provide them with the best service at the best price.
Established: 1994President: Wubbo de Boer Staff: 660
The Community trade mark and the Community registered design are the gateway to a single market.
Their unitary nature means that formalities and management can be kept simple:a single application,a single administrative centre and a single file to be managed.
A uniform law applies to trade marks and designs,thereby providing strong and unique protection throughout the European Union.
The simplification results in considerably reduced costs as compared with the overall costs of national registration in all countries of the European Union.
The size of the OHIM today,the speed at which it has grown and the way it became self-financing from its second year of operation are proofs of the success of the system at the service of the single market.
When ideas take shape, it’s time to protect them

European Agency for Safety and Health at Work
:"The continuous improvement of safety and health at work is a key objective of European social and employment policy.
However, the range and diversity of the occupational safety and health (OSH) issues that face Europe are beyond the resources and expertise of a single Member State or institution.This is why the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work was formed:to bring together and share the region’s vast pool of knowledge and information on OSH-related issues,particularly good prevention practices.
As well as developing a comprehensive network of safety and health websites,the Agency also runs campaigns and an active publications programme producing everything from specialist information reports to factsheets and covering a wide variety of OSH problems.
Established: 1994Director: Hans-Horst Konkolewsky Staff: 56
National focal points,typically the lead OSH organisation in their respective countries,coordinate and disseminate information from the Agency within their individual countries.In addition, the Agency cooperates with a wide range of partners including the European Commission,other European institutions and the European social partners,as well as international organisations and safety and health organisations worldwide.
An administrative board on which trade unions, employers’ organisations, national governments and the European Commission are represented runs the Agency.
Promoting quality of work in Europe
The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 of 18 July 1994 (OJ L 216, 20.8.1994), amended by Regulation (EC) No 1643/95 of 29.6.1995 (OJ L 156, 7.7.1995), and 1654/2003 (OJ L 245,29.9.2003). 29.9.2003).
Community Plant Variety Office ce
:"Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 of 27 July 1994,established a system of Community plant variety rights as the sole and exclusive form of Community industrial property rights for new plant varieties.The system is administered by the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO).
The CPVO is a self-financing Community body with legal personality which came into being on 27 April 1995.Since August 1997,the CPVO has been based in Angers (France).
Established: 1994President: Bart Kiewiet Staff: 38
The CPVO is managed by its President,assisted by a Vice-President,both appointed by the Council of the EU.
It consists of two units,the Technical Unit and the Finance and Administration Unit,all supported by IT,Personnel and Legal Services.
Such cooperation contributes in particular to the undertaking of large-scale projects, such as the creation of a terminology database for the European Union, and it also allows a concerted approach to be taken on issues such as external transla-tion, language technology,etc. etc.
Established: 1994Director: Francisco de Vicente Staff: 181
The Translation Centre is based in Luxembourg and is governed by a Management Board comprising representatives of all its clients,the Member States and the European Commission.
It has its own financial resources derived from the payments from the agencies, offi ces and institutions for services provided.The Translation Centre’s publications are available in paper and electronic form and include,in particular,an annual activity report and a quarterly newsletter.
European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia
:"The primary objective of the Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) is to provide the Community and its Member States with objective,reliable and comparable information and data on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism in the EU in order to help the EU and its Member States undertake measures or formulate courses of action against racism and xenophobia.
The EUMC studies the extent and development of racism and xenophobia,and analyses their causes,consequences and effects.It also works out strategies to combat racism and xenophobia and highlights and disseminates examples of good practice in tackling the issues.
Established: 1997Director: Beate Winkler Staff: 30
Address: Rahlgasse 3,A-1060 Vienna,Tel.: (43-1) 580 30-0Fax: (43-1) 580 30-93
The EUMC operates a European information network on racism and xenophobia (RAXEN) which collects information at national level.Raxen consists of 25 national focal points,one in each EU Member State.
The information from the national focal points is published in the form of comparative reports or national reports.
The EUMC works in cooperation with the EU institutions, intergovern-mental organisations and Member State governments.It also cooperates with civil society through round table meetings at national and European levels.
The EUMC undertakes a limited number of projects.
The EUMC publishes an annual report in two parts,the first part provides information on the EUMC’s activities and the second part provides information on the situation of racism and xenophobia in the European Union.
The EUMC was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1035/97 of 2 June 1997 (OJ L 151,10.6.1997) and commenced its activities in 1998.In December 2003,Heads of Government decided to extend the EUMC’s mandate to become a Human Rights Agency.
European Agency for Reconstruction
:"The European Agency for Reconstruction is responsible for the management of the main EU assistance programmes in Serbia and Montenegro (Republic of Serbia,Republic of Montenegro,UN-administered Kosovo) and FYR of Macedonia.
It was established in February 2000 and has its headquarters in Greece at Thessaloniki, and operational centres in Belgrade, Podgorica, Pristina and Skopje.
An independent agency of the European Union, it is accountable to the European Council and the European Parliament, and overseen by a governing board composed of representatives from the EU Member States and the European Commission.
The Agency now oversees a total portfolio of EUR 2.3 billion across its four operational centres.
Established: 2000Director: Richard Zink Staff: 270
The objectives of new EU-funded programmes managed by the Agency are: (i) to support good governance,institution building and the rule of law; (ii) to continue supporting the development of a market economy and to invest further in critical physical infrastructure and environmental actions,(iii) to support social develop ment and the strengthening of civil society.
Operational centres in Belgrade, Podgorica, Pristina and Skopje
From its early focus on post-crisis physical reconstruction,the Agency now manages projects which are designed to support the region’s own reform processes,and especially to help strengthen the‘State machinery’of central and local administration,the police,the judiciary,public fi nances, and State utility providers.
In its areas of operation,the Agency manages the majority of EC funds available under the Community assistance for reconstruction,development and stabilisation (‘CARDS’) programme,which is a wider EU commitment to Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, FYR of Macedonia,and Serbia and Montenegro. ‘CARDS’is part of the EU’s‘stabilisation and association’process which is currently in place with these five countries in south-eastern Europe.
European Food Safety Authority
:"The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) provides independent scientific advice on all matters with a direct or indirect impact on food safety — including animal health and welfare and plant protection.
EFSA is also consulted on nutrition in relation to Community legislation.The Authority communicates to the public in an open and transparent way on all matters within its remit.
EFSA’s risk assessments provide risk managers (EU institutions with political accountability, i.e. the European Commission,European Parliament and Council) with a sound scientific basis for defining policy-driven legislative or regulatory measures required to ensure a high level of consumer protection with regards to food safety.
Established: 2002Director: Geoffrey Podger Staff: 100 (15.6.2004)
Collection and analysis of scientific data, identifi cation of emerging risks and scientific support to the Commission,particularly in case of a food crisis,are also part of EFSA’s mandate,as laid down in the founding Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of 28 January 2002.
Provisional address:
EFSA is composed of four bodies:
Permanent address :
The Management Board is responsible for ensuring that the Authority functions effectively and effi ciently.
The Board is responsible for establishing the Authority’s draft budget and work programmes,monitoring their implementation, and agreeing to internal rules and regulations.It also appoints EFSA’s Executive Director and the members of the Scientific Committee and panels.
The Executive Director is the legal representative of the Authority and answers to the Management Board.Appointed for five years,which are renewable,he is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Authority and all staff matters.
The Executive Director is assisted by an Advisory Forum composed of representatives from the competent bodies in the Member States, which undertake tasks similar to those of the Authority.
EFSA’s scientific opinions and advice are provided by the Scientific Committee (SC) and eight scientific panels,each competent in a specific area of risk assessment.The Scientific Committee coordinates the work of the panels and addresses transversal issues relevant to all (e.g.methodology for exposure assessment).
European Maritime Safety Agency
:"European waters and coastlines have suffered several incidents that have led to very serious consequences in the matter of casualties and pollution.
The European Institutions therefore decided to create a specialised Agency to tighten up their pre-existing range of legal tools.This Agency will play an advisory role to the Member States and, also, a supporting role to the Directorate-General of Energy and Transport.It covers 25 Member States and, in addition, Norway and Iceland.
Established: 2003Director: Willem de Ruiter Staff: 50 (June 2004)
During the European Summit of 13 December 2003,Heads of State or Government decided to locate the Agency in Lisbon.Since its creation,the Agency has been based in Brussels.
European Aviation Safety Agency
:"The European Aviation Safety Agency is an agency of the European Union which has been given specific regulatory and executive tasks in the field of aviation safety.
The Agency constitutes a key part of the European Union’s strategy to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe.
The Agency’s mission is twofold.It shall provide technical expertise to the European Commission by assisting in the drafting of rules for aviation safety in various areas and providing technical input to the conclusion of the relevant international agreements.
Established: 15 July 2002Executive Director: Patrick Goudou Staff: 95
The European Aviation Safety Agency certifies products from civil aviation alto-gether, including general and business aviation.It is important to note that its remit does not cover aviation security (prevention of illegal actions against civil aviation like hijacking,for instance).This comes under the remit of the Community law applied by the Member States.
The Community legislator has already decided that,in the longer term,these competencies should be progressively enlarged to all other areas of civil aviation safety,notably to air operations and flight crew licensing.
The European Aviation Safety Agency was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2002 (OJ L 240,7.9.2002). 7.9.2002).

Preface he competition policy pursued by the European Commission has a direct impact on thedaily life of the citizens of the European Union.
T wider access to air transport and the possibility of buying a car in the EU country in which pricesare lowest are tangible results.
Other, less visible, areas of Community competition policy alsoproduce positive effects for the public.
For example, merger control ensures a diversity of mass-market consumer goods and low prices for the final consumer.
Likewise, by contributing to economic and social cohesion, the monitoring of State aid helps to promote viable anddurable jobs throughout the Union.
Whether they be consumers, savers, users of public services,employees or taxpayers, the Union’s citizens enjoy the fruits of the competition policy in thevarious aspects of their everyday life.
The competition policy implemented by the Commission and by the Member States’ authoritiesand law courts aims to preserve and develop a state of effective competition in the commonmarket by impacting on the structure of markets and the conduct of market players.
Requiringfirms to compete with each other fosters innovation, reduces production costs, increaseseconomic efficiency and, consequently, enhances the competitiveness of the European economy,particularly vis-à-vis its main trading partners.
Firms stimulated by competition thus offer productsand services which are competitive in terms of price and quality.
These competitive products and services are of benefit initially to downstream firms, which gainin terms of efficiency and are able to pass the improved productivity on through their ownproduction processes. The liberalisation of network industries, for example, has in the first placeimproved the competitiveness of European industry, which has benefited from more efficient andless expensive transport, telecommunications and energy services.
The propagation of thecompetitive process thus helps to consolidate the industrial fabric of the internal market and, in so doing, provides clear back-up to employment policies.
Secondly, greater competition allows the consumer to choose from a wider range of productsand services at lower prices.
Thus, the same policy of liberalisation has had concrete effects forusers in terms of lower prices and access to new services.
A recent study has shown that sometelephone charges have fallen by 35 %.
The European Commission has exclusive power to monitor the State aid granted by the Member States’ public authorities.
Aid is in principle prohibited by the Treaty if, by favouring certain firms,it is liable to cause damage to their competitors in other Member States, which in some casesmight go as far as to jeopardise their very survival and, consequently, the jobs of their
Only if aid is justified by the existence of a Community interest will the Commissiongrant exemption from this general principle of prohibition.
In some cases, State aid merely leads to activities which no longer meet the requirements of economic efficiency being maintained artificially, or to competition with efficient firms in the same sector being distorted.
Public aid sometimes has a purely placebo effect on firms in difficulty.
For example, 30 % of assisted firms in the former German Democratic Republichad closed down within two years of receiving aid.
Community policy prefers to give priority to measures which restore a firm’s competitiveness, such as restructuring plans; only measuresof this kind can return the firm to viability and provide durable jobs.
Aid that serves merely to maintain the firm in existence also seriously disturbs markets and is detrimental to competingfirms which make the necessary effort to remain competitive. The Commission’s endeavours infavour of such firms protect them against unjustified economic discrimination.
I have taken particular pains to improve transparency in the area of monitoring State aid so thatthe European public is better informed of just how much public aid is being granted and of whatthe Commission is doing in this area.
I have asked for the establishment of an aid register listingall of the Commission’s decisions concerning State aid, and of a scoreboard which would enableit to be seen whether Member States are complying with the State aid rules.
We must alsoimprove the economic analysis of aid granted in order better to evaluate its cost and impact onthe internal market.
I am convinced that transparency will enable the public and itsrepresentatives to become more involved in aid-monitoring policy.
Effective competition improves the European public’s quality of life and purchasing power, andthe public is entitled to expect the Commission —and national competition authorities and lawcourts —to tackle obstacles to competition and thereby defend its interests. The Commission’scompetition policy meets this requirement in full.
It enhances the quality and variety of goodsplaced on the market, fosters technological innovation and economic performance and, finally,promotes fair prices for users.
However, the Commission’s competition policy is not limited to protecting consumers from thedangers that face them.
It also seeks to preserve and stimulate their ability to operate on themarket in such a way as to contribute to the competitive process.
In conclusion, the Commission and its departments responsible for competition encourage theactive participation of consumers and their organisations.
Given their knowledge of the day-to-day functioning of markets, in particular those in mass-market consumer goods, consumerorganisations are able to provide the Commission with information of interest to the Community by raising complaints or through informal contact.
Such information may enable the Commission to initiate investigation proceedings concerning practices which distort competition.
Consumer organisations are also able to establish links of this kind with the national competitionauthorities where signs of restrictive practices emerge more at national than at Community level.
This brochure has the dual objective of informing the public of the real benefits it can expectfrom European competition policy and arousing its interest and canvassing its help inimplementing that policy.
I hope that the European public will respond favourably to this request.
I am convinced that a rigorous application of competition policy is the best way of guaranteeingeconomic freedom.
Economic freedom, within a proper regulatory framework, is a precondition for the development of a free society.
Freedom of competition is thus a publicfreedom.
It impacts not only on the economic environment but also on the organisation ofsociety at large.
It is in this way that competition policy is a ‘people’s’ policy.
Member of the European Commission responsible for competition policy
A brief outline
Member States are to adopt an economic policy ‘conducted in accordancewith the principle of an open market economy with free competition’.
The Community’s competition policy pursues a precise goal, which is to defendand develop effective competitionin the common market.
Competition is abasic mechanism of the market economyinvolving supply(producers, traders)and demand(intermediate customers, consumers). Suppliers offer goods orservices on the market in an endeavour to meet demand.
Demand seeks thebest ratio between quality and pricefor the products it requires. The mostefficient response emerges as a result of a contest between suppliers.
Thus,competition leads everybody individually to seek out the means of striking thisbalance between quality and price in order to meet demand to the best possible
The Community’scompetition policypursues a precise goal,which is to defend anddevelop effectivecompetition in thecommon market.
extent. Competition is therefore a simple and efficientmeans of guaranteeing consumers a level of excellencein terms of the quality and price of products andservices.
It also forces firms to strive for competitivenessand economic efficiency.
This consolidates the Community’s industrial and commercial fabric so that itis able to confront the competitiveness of our mainpartners and to put Community firms in a position tosucceed in markets around the world.
In order to be effective, competition assumes that themarket is made up of suppliers who are independentof each other, each subject to the competitive pressureexerted by the others.In order to preserve the ability of suppliers to exert such pressure on the market,competition law sets out to prohibit agreements or practices which might reduce it.
European competition policy is based on a Community legislative frameworkessentially provided by the EC Treaty (Articles 81 to 90).
Further rules areprovided by a Council regulation known as the merger regulation.
On the basisof this body of law, competition policy focuses on four main areas of action.
• The elimination of agreements which restrict competition and of abuses of adominant position(e.g. price-fixing agreements between competitors).
• The control of mergers between firms(e.g. a merger between two large groupswhich results in their dominating the market).
• The liberalisation of monopolistic economic sectors(e.g. telecommunications).
• The monitoring of State aid(e.g. the prohibition of a State grant designed to keepa loss-making firm in business even though it has no prospect of recovery).
Community law strives to defend the common market and stimulate competitionwithin what is a vast economic area.
It does not enter into play until such timeas trade between Member States is affectedby the practices in question.
Forexample, a price-fixing agreement between bakers in a given town will not haveany impact on the Community market, and European law is therefore notapplicable to this kind of situation.
However, such an agreement would probablybe covered by domestic law.
The condition that trade be affected is central to all Community provisions.
The European Commissionhas the power to deal with these matters.
In some cases, this power is shared with the Member States’ own competitionauthorities and law courts(Articles 81 and 82), while in others it liesexclusivelywith the Commission (merger control, monitoring of State aid).
It is shared when a rule is generally applicable throughout the Community.
Both the Commission and the courts in the Member States have a duty toenforce such rules.
By contrast, it is exclusive when the legislative provision inquestion expressly stipulates that this is the case.
For the control of large-scalemergers, the Member States considered it necessary to create a one-stop shop.They appointed the European Commission to that end.
For State aid, thedecision whether or not aid granted by Member States is illegal can be takenonly by a supranational and independent authority.
That authority is the European Commission.
Finally, it should be added that most Member States have their own domesticlawsto counter anti-competitive practices (restrictive agreements, abuses of adominant position, and mergers).
National law makes it possible to take actionagainst practices which do not have any impact on trade between Member States.
A rigorous procedure is laid down in various implementing regulations.
Theyconfer powers of investigationon the Commission’s agents.
Due processisguaranteed, as is commercial confidentiality.
Commission policy would be ineffective if its monitoring and control activitieswere not accompanied by decisionsand penalties.
In the area of its anti-trustoperations, the Commission has the power not only to prohibitan agreement orto issue an injunctionthat a restrictive practice be stopped, but also to imposefineson firms found guilty of anti-competitive conduct.
The amount of thesefinesis calculated according to the gravity and duration of the infringement.Some of the most serious practices are price cartels or abusive conduct by firmsholding a virtual monopoly.
In determining the amount of a fine, the Commission takes account of any aggravating circumstances (e.g. repetition ofan infringement) or mitigatingcircumstances (e.g. cooperation by the firm).Fines may be as much as 10 % of the firm’s worldwide turnover.
With regard to State aid, the Commission has the power to require that illegallygranted aid be repaidby recipients to the public authorities which granted it.The Member State must recoverthe aid immediately in accordance withdomestic procedures.
An appeal against a Commission decision may be lodged with the Court of First Instance or the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
Restrictiveagreements andabuse of a dominant position
Restrictive agreements
Some agreements between enterprises impair competition.
The most familiarexample is an agreement on prices, or cartel, whereby firms fix price levelsjointly so that consumers are unable to take advantage of competition betweensuppliers to obtain competitive prices.
The result for the final consumer is anincrease in market prices.
Other agreements have the object or effect of fixingother conditions for the operation of markets: for example, they may allocateproduction quotas to firms or share markets between them.
Agreements of thistype are prohibited in the European Community because they distortcompetition and are detrimental to the various operators on the market.
Where there is a price-fixing agreement, for example, firms do not try to providenew products or services of good quality at competitive prices, and insteadmerely exploit a situation that they have created themselves where consumerscan no longer decide between several prices or different types of product or
Some agreementsbetween enterprisesimpair competition.
forms of distribution. In those circumstances, enterprises no longer have to be reallycompetitive and have no incentive to innovate or reduce production costs.
In the medium term, those firms will be exposed to the full force of competitionwhen a competitor which is not a party to the agreement appears; this willresult in a serious crisis liable to involve reductions in workforce or closures of enterprises.
The crisis thus affects employees, subcontractors and traders.Moreover, artificially high prices affect the costs of intermediate consumers,who are adversely affected by their suppliers’ anti-competitive behaviour.
The dynamism of those enterprises is therefore dampened.
Lastly, finalconsumers pay more for products or services, have a restricted choice and donot benefit from technical or economic progress.
The anti-competitive behaviour of a few firms thus harms all operators andjustifies the intervention of the authorities.
In each of the last three years, the European Commission has dealt on average with over 400 cases concerningagreements restricting competition.
Community law (Article 81)
Agreements restricting competition are prohibited by Article 81 of the EC Treaty.
If an agreement fulfils the following conditions, it is void: it is concluded between firms or ‘undertakings’;
• • it leads to an appreciable restriction of competition on the market.
It may fixpurchase or selling prices or other trading conditions; it may limit production,markets, technical development or investment.
It may also share markets orsources of supply between competitors.
Lastly, it may apply discriminatory conditions to firms that are not parties to the agreement, placing them at acompetitive disadvantage.
An agreement is considered to restrict competition if itinterferes appreciably with the normal interplay of supply and demand.
However, some agreements may encourage competition, because they promote technical progress or improve distribution, for example.
Under Community law, those agreements can be exempted from the prohibition because they ultimately have a beneficial effect on the market.
Four tests must be satisfied if an agreement is to qualify for an exemption:
• it must improve the production or distribution of goods or promote economic
Article progress; it must allow intermediate or final consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit;
• • the restriction of competition must be indispensable to the attainment of the firsttwo conditions;
• it must not eliminate competition in respect of a substantial proportion of theproducts or services in question.
Some examples of actiontaken by the Commission
In October 1998, the Commission terminated a cartel between producers of distance-heating pipes, which had jointly fixed prices and terms for tenders to public authorities.
The cartel was set up in Denmark at the end of 1990 and subsequently extended to Germany and other EU Member States.
From 1994, the entire European market was covered.
In Denmark and Germany, the companies developed a system to rig tendering procedures: a ‘favourite’ was assigned to win each contract, with the other members of the cartel submitting tenders that were much higher than the ‘favourite’s’.
V of the cartel shared national markets and jointly fixed prices for distance-heating
Under Community law, an individual agreement between firms can be exempted,and so can categories of agreements of the same nature, such as distributionagreements for example.
At present only the European Commission can exercise the power to exempt arestrictive agreement under Article 81.
To obtain an individual exemption, firmsmust notify their agreements to the European Commission.
In recent years, the Commission has received on average over 200 such notifications annually.
In 1999, it suggested terminating this centralised notification of all agreementsbetween enterprises.
Many agreements that are notified do not involve seriousproblems for competition.
The Commission therefore hopes to concentrate moreon agreements that seriously harm competition in the common market, particularlycartels. It also hopes to involve the competition authorities and courts of the
Apart from proceeding on formal notifications by firms, the Commission can also carry out its own investigations following complaints from competitors or
These restrictive agreements are automatically void, and the Commission haspower to prohibit them and impose fines on the offending firms.
In certain conditions, it may also exempt some agreements that restrict competition.
In addition, it enjoys investigatory powers entitling it to inspect firms’ premises insearch of evidence of secret agreements.
The Commission imposed fines totalling approximately EUR92 million on the members of the cartel.
In this case, the anti-competitive practice harmed firms outside the cartel, which were systematically excludedfrom calls for tenders, as well as local authorities and hence taxpayers.
Cartel prohibited in the sugar sector
Two sugar producers and two sugar traders in the United Kingdom adopted aconcerted strategy for increasing prices on the sugar market.
The result of thisagreement, for the final consumer, was purchase prices that were higher thanthey would have been with free competition.
In 1998, the Commission thereforeprohibited the agreement and imposed fines totalling more than EUR 50 millionon the firms.
Agreement concerning digital television exempted
The Commission exempted an agreement setting up a joint venture known as Open which had been concluded between four enterprises including BSkyB and British Telecom, both British companies involved in digital television andtelecommunications.
Open will offer new digital interactive television services inthe United Kingdom.
After the new venture has been set up, businesses such asbanks, supermarkets or travel agencies will be able to offer British consumers interactive services via television. Access to the services will be through a decoder.
Despitethe undeniable advantages for consumers, the Commissionraised objections. BSkyB and British Telecom, which holdsignificant positions on the market in the areas where Open would be operating, would disappear as potentialcompetitors, and there was a risk of eliminating asubstantial part of competition on the British market in interactive digitaltelevision.
Before the Commission authorised the agreement, it satisfied itself that competition would continue after Open was set up.
For example,commitments given by Open’s shareholders will provide access to the market forthird parties.
Third parties will have access to Open decoders and to BSkyB’s cinema and sport channels.
Lastly, decoders in competition with Open decoderscan be sold on the market without hindrance.
In this case, the Commissionsought to make it easier for new digital interactive television services to developwhile at the same time ensuring that there was competition on the market.
The benefit to British consumers is therefore twofold.
Abuse of adominant position
Efficient businesses are run with a view to conquering markets, to the pointwhere they may establish very strong positions indeed.
Holding a dominantposition is not wrong in itself.
It is the result of the firm’s own effectiveness.
But if the firm exploits its power to stifle competition, this is an anti-competitive practice which constitutes abuse.
It is therefore the abuse of the dominantposition that is wrong.
A firm holds a dominant position if its economic power enables it to operate onthe market without taking account of the reaction of its competitors or ofintermediate or final consumers. In those circumstances, an enterprise holding adominant position may be tempted to abuse that position to increase its incomeand consolidate its hold on the market by weakening or eliminating competitorsand denying access to the market for new entrants.
It might take unfair actionagainst other operators on the market, for example, by charging exorbitantpurchase or selling prices or by conferring discriminatory benefits on certaincustomers in order to control their behaviour.
Those practices interfere withcompetition.
The Commission can act against them and punish their perpetratorsseverely.
Citizens have good reason to be apprehensive of abuses of this kind, whichresult in higher prices, restrictions on the availability of products and services and unfair trading conditions.
Community law
(Article 82)
Article 82 of the EC Treaty prohibits the abuse of a dominant position. For the article to apply, the following conditions must be fulfilled.
• The firm holds a dominant position.
In appraising the firm’s economic power, the Commission takes account of its market share and also of other factors suchas whether there are credible competitors, whether the firm has its owndistribution network, whether it has favourable access to raw materials, etc. These are all factors which allow the firm to evade normal competition.
• The firm dominates the common market or a ‘substantial part’ of the common market.
• The firm abuses its position: it may overcharge consumers, or charge prices that are excessively low so as to exclude weaker competitors or new entrants from the market for example, or it may grant some customers discriminatory advantages such as fidelity rebates provided they agree to comply with its sales policy.
Article 82
There is no exemption available for abuse of a dominant position.
The Commission can adopt a decision prohibiting an abuse and fining theoffending firm.
In 1998 and 1999, the Commission adopted around a dozendecisions prohibiting abuses.
Some examples of action taken by the Commission
Abuse of a dominant position on the ice-cream distribution market
As a result of a complaint submitted by Mars, the Commission found that Unilever had abused its dominant position.
Unilever provided freezer cabinets toits Irish distributors free of any direct charge on condition that they stocked only Unilever products there.
Irish consumers therefore had a very restricted choice ofice-creams.
The Commission considered that having regard to Unilever’sdominant position on the market the requirement of exclusive use constitutedan abuse.
Abuse of a dominant position on the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies
Acting on a complaint by Virgin Airways, the Commission found in July 1999that British Airways had abused a dominant position.
The abuse consisted ofestablishing a system of brand loyalty, which meant that the market in airtransport services provided by travel agencies was closed to British Airways’competitors.
British Airways offered some British travel agencies extracommission if they equalled or exceeded their previous year’s sales of British Airways’ tickets.
The effect of the system was toreinforce agencies’ brand loyalty to British Airwaysand to discourage them from offering the services of
/ other airlines.
British Airways held a dominant position, so that the systemformed a real barrier to competing airlines’ access to the market.
Since theagencies favoured the airline paying the highest commission, consumers werealmost always offered British Airways’ tickets even if competitors’ services weremore advantageous.
The Commission therefore considered that this practice,which affected the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies,constituted an abuse of a dominant position.
Abuse of a dominant position in the organisation of the Football World Cup
On 20 July 1999, the Commission adopted a formal decision against the Frenchcommittee organising the Football World Cup which was held in France in 1998.The committee, the CFO, held a monopoly in the organisation of the event thatincluded ticket sales.
The Commission found that the arrangements for ticketsales for the final matches were discriminatory and constituted an abuse of adominant position.
The arrangements made for ticket sales favoured consumerswho could provide an address in France, at the expense of consumers residentin other countries.
Persons not resident in France who wished to see the finalswere thus at a severedisadvantage compared withpersons resident in France.The Commission thereforeruled against the CFO.
Merger control
When companies combine via a merger, an acquisition or the creation of a jointventure, this generally has a positive impact on markets.
The linking-up of thefirms’ activities enables them to achieve synergy in numerous areas, such asresearch and the development of new products, or sometimes to implementrestructuring measures that will reduce production or distribution costs for thenew company.
They thus become more efficient on the market.
Competitionintensifies and the final consumer will benefit from higher-quality goods at fairerprices.
In the context of the globalisation of trade coupled with the further developmentof the single market in the Community, firms are being driven to combine inorder to reach a size which will allow them to remain competitive and presenton markets that are extending all the time. In recent years, the merger trend inthe European Union has gained pace.
Mergers which create orstrengthen a dominantposition, however, areprohibited by the Treatyin order to preventensuing abuses.
Mergers which create or strengthen a dominantposition, however, are prohibited by the Treaty inorder to prevent ensuing abuses. A firm is in adominant position when it is able to act on themarket without having to take account of thereaction of its competitors, suppliers orcustomers.
For example, such a firm can increaseits prices above those of its competitors withoutfearing any loss of profit.
All market players andespecially consumers stand to lose from theemergence of this kind of dominant structure, which is likely to result in higher prices, a narrower choice of goods or scarcityof innovation.
That is why the European Union has set up an advance vettingsystem for mergers with a Community dimension that enables it to prohibit aplanned merger if necessary.
Identical systems have been set up in the Member States for investigating mergers of national dimension.
Public opinion does not always understand why the Commission approvesmergers and acquisitions when they involve loss of jobs.
It must be borne inmind that the Commission’s objective in the merger control field is to preserve asituation of effective competition on the markets, which it considers to be aguarantee of growth and thus of viable jobs.
It may be that, in the short term,efforts to improve the competitiveness of firms by means of mergers oracquisitions involve restructuring and thus loss of jobs.
However, this does notchange the fact that improving firms’ competitiveness is the only effective wayto ensure the growth needed to create business and stable and lasting jobs.
(Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89)
The Community’s system for monitoring this type of transaction has beengoverned by the merger regulation since 1990.
The regulation is based on thefollowing principles.
• The European Commission has exclusive power to investigate mergers with a
Community dimension. Firms thus have a one-stop shop for merger control,and this facilitates administrative procedures and ensures that they receiveequal treatment.
The Community dimension of a merger or acquisition isassessed using thresholds based on the turnover of the companies involved.The most important are the worldwide threshold (EUR 5 000 million) and the Community-wide threshold (EUR 250 million).
Below these thresholds, mergercontrol is carried out by the authorities in the Member States under their ownlegislation.
• Mergers and acquisitions with a Community dimension have to be notified to the Commission for its agreement before they are put into effect.
Since theentry into force of the merger regulation, the Commission has seen thenumber of notifications grow very rapidly, especially in recent years, when the annual rate of growth has been around 30 %.
The Commission currently receives close on 300 notifications every year.
• After an initial scrutiny period of one month, the Commission decides either to
Regulation authorise the transaction or, if it thinks that a dominant position might be created or strengthened, to initiate a four-month investigation procedure.
• At the end of this procedure, the Commission may authorise the merger
(EEC) No 4064/89 conditionally or unconditionally, or it may prohibit it, for example in cases where the companies have not been able to propose appropriate solutions to theconcerns raised by the Commission.
‘Conditions’ attached to the authorisationfrequently entail the sale to competitors of assets, shares in other companies,patents, etc.
(more than 90 %).
In a market in the process of integration, mergers whichcreate or strengthen a dominant position are, in fact, quite rare.
• Most cases going through the four-month investigation procedure are resolved by a conditional authorisation.
This means that the Commission’s authorisationis based on the companies giving undertakings or ‘commitments’ to makevarious divestments that will allow effective competition to be restored after themerger. These commitments are very closely examined by Commission staff.
Insome cases, the merger is prohibited; not only would it create or strengthen adominant position, but the firms have also been unable to propose a solutionto the competition concerns raised by the Commission.
Mergers in the retail distribution sector
In recent years, numerous large retailers have notified merger plans to the European Commission.
Examples are the food retailers Kesko/Tuko in Finland(1997), Rewe/Mainl in Austria (1999) and Carrefour/Promodès in France and Spain (2000).
In both the Finnish and Austrian cases, the Commissionconsidered that the merger of these retail chains would have created adominant position; in the Finnish case, it decided to prohibit the transaction,while in the Austrian case it accepted the remedies proposed by the companies,which consisted essentially of the sale of certain outlets to competitors.
The merger of Carrefour and Promodès was authorised subject to thedivestment of a majorshareholding in acompetitor.
But theanalysis of competitiveconditions at locallevel was left to thenational competitionauthorities, since themerger involved aseries of very localisedcompetition problems.
The Commission thus ensured thatcompetition waspreserved or restored in order to allow consumers to continue to benefit from achoice of outlets, attractive prices and a diverse range of consumer goods.
A merger in the insurance sector
Insurance policyholders and investors, especially in Italy, stand to benefit fromthe remedies proposed by the companies in the context of INA’s acquisition by Generali; both companies are large international insurance firms.
The initialanalysis of the takeover led the Commission to form serious doubts about itscompatibility with Community law.
It would have given the new firm sizeableshares of the market for the supply of various life-assurance products in Italy.
In addition, the investigation revealed links between the two firms and theirmain competitors that could have induced them to coordinate their behaviourin the insurance and investment fields.
In January 2000, the Commissionauthorised the planned takeover on condition that the parties put into effecttheir proposal that they would sell their shares in certain subsidiaries, therebyreducing their market shares to less than 30 %, and that they cut off their linkswith their competitors.
Effective competition was thus restored in Italy in afinancial sector that primarily concerns the public.
A merger in the petroleum products sector
French citizens and people travelling across France have everything to gain from the Commission’s action in the TotalFina/Elf Aquitaine case.
The merging of theoperations of the two main players in the French petroleum products sector wouldhave created a dominant position onseveral markets. After the merger, TotalFina
The merging of theoperations of the twomain players in the French petroleumproducts sector wouldhave created a dominantposition on severalmarkets.
/ and Elf would have been able to control a large part of the logistical network in France and to push up supply costs for independent distributors and especiallyfor supermarkets, which play an important role in the French market.
The supermarkets have helped to reduce fuel prices in France and to keep them at fairlylow levels.
Furthermore, the combination of TotalFina and Elf service stations on French motorways would have given the new group a market share of some 60 %.
The Commission considered that this level of market power would have pushedup prices in a market where they were already high.
Lastly, TotalFina and Elfwould have become the leader on the market for LPG, used for heating. In orderto resolve the competition problems identified, TotalFina/Elf undertook to sell alarge proportion of the operations concerned to competitors.
For example, itproposed selling 70 motorway service stations in France to competitors.
In this way, the Commission ensured that the French fuel markets remainedcompetitive and that consumers continued to benefit from the supply ofpetroleum products at fair prices.
The public authorities in the Member States may grant special rights, inparticular monopoly rights, to public or private undertakings to perform servicesof general economic interest in sectors such as postal deliveries, rail transport orelectricity generation and distribution.
These special rights generally correspondto responsibilities linked to the performance of the public service entrusted tothe undertaking.
However, the special rights must not go beyond what is necessary for the performance of that service.
Otherwise, from the point of view of Community law, they would createsituations that restrict competition.
The public authorities in the Member States may grantspecial rights, in particularmonopoly rights, to public orprivate undertakings toperform services of generaleconomic interest.
Monopolies entrusted to undertakings, where they are not justified by a service ofgeneral economic interest, lead in mostcases to high prices, poorer quality serviceand backwardness in terms of innovationand investment. That is why the Commissionconsiders that competition should beintroduced in monopoly industries, in the context of the Treaty rules, so as to improve the quality of service and to bring price levels down.
Frequently, these monopolies have been innetwork industries —transport, energy andtelecommunications.
In these sectors, a distinction must be made between theinfrastructure and the services provided overthis infrastructure.
While it is often difficult toestablish a second, competing infrastructure, for reasons linked to investment costs andeconomic efficiency, it is possible and desirableto create competitive conditions in respect ofthe services provided.
The Commission hastherefore developed the concept of separating infrastructure from commercial activities.
The infrastructure is thus merely the vehicle of competition.
While the right toexclusive ownership may persist as regards the infrastructure (the telephone orelectricity network for example), monopolists must grant access to third partieswishing to compete with them as regards the services offered on their networks(telephone communications or electricity consumption).
This is the generalprinciple on which the Community liberalisation directives are based.
As a rule, and bearing in mind the sectors concerned, the process of opening upthese sectors to competition has a positive impact for intermediate users andcontributes to an overall improvement in the competitiveness of our economy, and also for final consumers, who benefitfrom lower prices and more efficient services.
The process of opening up these sectors tocompetition has a positiveimpact for intermediateusers, and also for finalconsumers.
The opening-up of the telecommunications sector to competition is the best example ofthe success of the liberalisation process.Exposing the public operators with formermonopoly power over infrastructures andservices to competition with new telecommu- nications companies has resulted in a considerable fall in charges (by as muchas 35 % for certain types of communication) and an overall improvement in theservice provided to the user, in terms of quality of service, wider range of supplyand technological innovation.
In a sector of the economy which is experiencingrapid growth driven by the emergence of the Internet and of electroniccommerce, the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry is a source ofcompetitiveness and new jobs.
Community law (Article 86)
The Commission has various means of applying the principle of opening upmonopoly markets.
The Commission checks that Member States, when they grant special orexclusive rights, comply with the Community competition rules.
It is particularlyvigilant in ensuring that public authorities, when setting the conditions in whichservices of general interest entrusted to undertakings are performed, do not gobeyond what is strictly necessary to the performance of those services.
Depending on the circumstances, it may itself adopt a European liberalisation directive, or propose that such a directive be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament.
A directive is a piece of Community legislation which sets a common objective to be attained by all Member States, one that each Member State will incorporate
Article 86 into its own legislation and enforce.
It was in this way that the European Unioninitiated the opening-up of the telecommunications, transport, postal, gas andelectricity markets.
The Commission checks that these objectives are actuallyachieved.
Mobile telephones in Spain
The liberalisation of mobile telephony in Europe wasintroduced by a 1996 Community directive opening upthe mobile and personal communications market tocompetition.
At the end of 1996, the Commission foundthat the second mobile telephone operator in Spain,Airtel Móvil, had been required to pay around
EUR 510 million for the right to operate on the Spanish market, while Telefónica, the State operator, had been allowed to provide mobile telephone services without
In restoring thebalance between Telefónica and Airtel Móvil, the Commissionsought to stimulatecompetition in theinterest of mobile telephone users in Spain.
advantage over its new competitor, enabling it tostrengthen its dominant position on the mobiletelephony market.
The Commission thereforerequired the Spanish Government to reimbursethe EUR 510 million to Airtel Móvil or to proposeequivalent corrective measures.
In restoring thebalance between Telefónica and Airtel Móvil, the Commission sought to stimulate competitionin the interest of mobile telephone users in Spain, who would benefit from new services and lower prices.
In April 1997, the Commission accepted the correctivemeasures proposed by the Spanish Government with a view to ending the distortion of competition.
Television advertising in Belgium
The Commission prohibited the exclusive right to broadcast television advertisinggranted to the commercial station VTM by the Flemish Community authorities in Belgium. Granting VTM an exclusive right to broadcast, from Flanders, advertisingaimed at Flemish viewers was equivalent to excluding any operator from another Member State that wished to set itself up in Belgium in order to broadcastadvertising aimed at the Flemish public over the Belgian cable televisionnetwork.
The Commission decided that there was no necessary relation betweenthe stated cultural policy objective of preserving pluralism in the Flemish printedpress and the granting in Flanders of a monopoly on commercial television to VTM.
These measures ultimately constituted a form of discrimination withprotectionist consequences that also affected Belgian viewers from the Flemish Community, whose choice of television stations was restricted.
Scrutiny of State aid
State aid that distorts intra-Community competition is prohibited by the Treaty.By giving certain firms or products favoured treatment to the detriment of otherfirms or products, it seriously disrupts normal competitive forces.
But in certaincases, the European Commission will apply the exceptions allowed by the Treatyand have regard to the beneficial impact of an aid scheme in Union termsoverall, and authorise aid where it is justified on grounds of, for example,regional development or the promotion of policies of common interest:protection of the environment, research and development, training, etc.
Aid given by public authorities most commonly supports a firm, an economicactivity or a region in order to promote its development or alleviate its difficulties.
At first sight, particularly from the recipient’sangle, State aid might well seem to be beneficial.
But very often all it achieves is to delay inevitablerestructuring operations without helping the recipientactually to return to competitiveness.
Looking at things in a broader context, particularly fromthe angle of competing firms that are operating unaided, State aid ratherresembles an unwarranted form of discrimination. Competing firms have to workalone to develop their business and stay competitive as against those for whompublic support has made it unnecessary to curb production costs or finance a
development or diversification programme.
Unsubsidised firms can even run intodifficulties that will impact on their competitiveness and ability to keep theiremployees in jobs.
Ultimately, then, the entire market will suffer from State aid,and the general competitiveness of the European economy is imperilled.
Of course, there are certain forms of aid that can be considered acceptable onthe grounds that they contribute to the developmentof regions that are sufferingparticularly badly, or seek to remedy a serious economic situation in a Member State, or encourage certain activities and practices that are of common interestto all the Member States, or have useful social purposes.
Aid to particularlybackward regions can help them catch up on their development backlog and become equalcompetitors with the other, more developedregions.
Once these regions have removed theirhandicaps, however, there is no further justificationfor continuing to pay development aid there.
That would be discriminatory in relation todeveloped regions where aid schemes do notoperate.
Regional development aid would then be illegal in the Commission’sview and would run counter to the Treaty’s objective of economic and socialcohesion.
Likewise, aid to restructure firms can be authorised if it is a one-offmeasure accompanied by a restructuring plan that is capable of restoring thefirm’s health and viability.
Despite the general principle that aid is prohibited, the total amount of State aid in the Community in 1996–98 was EUR 93 000 million –EUR 250 for each Union citizen.
The Commission considers that the figure is too high.
The Commission’s monitoring of State aid has a considerable impact on day-to-day life and offers three main beneficial effects.
It confines aid schemes to what is strictly necessary and thus avoids waste of public funds.
By preventingdistortions of intra-Community competition that would be deleterious to thesingle market, it boosts economic growth in the Union and promotesemployment as a result.
And it contributes to improving standards of living andquality of life by authorising only aid schemes whose objectives really are in thecommon interest –the development of backward regions, promotion of smallbusinesses, research and development, training, or help for firms that are intemporary difficulty which, given adequate and carefully monitored assistance,will revert to being sources of prosperity and employment with a role to play inthe single market.
(Articles 87 and 88)
Article 87 of the EC Treaty prohibits any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distortcompetition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.
Aid can take a variety of forms: grants and interest relief, of course, but also taxrelief.
Aid can be given in the form of a State guarantee or holding, or evenprovision by the State of goods and services on preferential terms.
Article 87allows certain forms of aid:•aid having a social character, granted to individual consumers;
• aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptionaloccurrences;
•aid designed to:
— promote the economic development of areas regarded as particularlybackward in accordance with Community criteria,— promote the execution of an important project of common Europeaninterest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State,
— facilitate the development of certain activities or areas,
— promote culture and heritage conservation; where, in the last two cases, such aid does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent that is contrary to the common
The Commission has adopted a number of documents to clarify its State aid policy.
They are called ‘guidelines’ or ‘frameworks’.
They concern regions lagging behind in terms of development, R & D, employment and training, small and medium-sized businesses, protection of the environment and the rescue and and 88 restructuring of firms in difficulty.
The Commission generally takes a favourable approach to such schemes as long as they do not distort competition to an extentincompatible with the common interest.
The Commission also scrutinises aid schemes illegally implemented by the Member States without prior notification and without awaiting authorisation.
It isoften apprised of such schemes via complaints from firms. Incompatible schemesare banned, and the offending Member State may well be required to recover thesums paid out.
The recipient of unlawful aid will have to pay it back.
Aid schemes authorised
Aid for the development of less favoured urban areas In October 1996, France notified the Commission of an ‘Urban Revitalisation Pact’; the Commission made it clear that it was basically in favour of aid for lessfavoured urban areas.
Certain forms of State financial support for firms can be anecessary means of tackling structural handicaps and excess costs flowing fromlocation in such areas.
The objective of this aid is to help alleviate or evenremove a number of problems (employment, development, etc.) facing certainurban areas.
Residents there are the immediate beneficiaries of such aid, whichthe Commission looks on with some favour, particularly where it accompaniesother Community programmes for the development of poorer areas.
Regional aid for small businesses In February 1998, the Commission approved aid totalling EUR 1.89 million forthe development of small tourism businesses in the area of Doñana, in southern Spain.
Their chief purpose was to provideincentives for investment in the formation of newtourism businesses and the creation of jobs inthat industry.
They thus contributed to thesustainable development of this relatively poorregion of the Union.
Andalusia is a region eligiblefor special status as regards State aid under the Treaty, given that its standard of living is wellbelow the Community average.
Aid authorised conditionally
Air transport Most national airlines have responded to the liberalisation of air transport in Europeby developing restructuring and recapitalisation plans to restore theircompetitiveness.
In 1997, the Commission gave conditional authorisation forpayment of aid worth EUR 1 400 million to Alitalia.
Its assessment was based interaliaon the viability of the restructuring plan and the commitments given by the Italian authorities (for instance, the company is to be managed on commerciallines), the complete absence of discrimination infavour of Alitalia and the absence of a dominantinfluenceover prices.
The Commission consideredthat the aid would be conducive to the developmentof air transport in Europe without adverselyaffecting trade between Member States to anextent contrary to the common interest.
It actedwith the twofold concern to preserve a company inthe process of return to viability on the air transportmarket without jeopardising competition: consumerswould benefit both from Alitalia’s services and from those of its competitors.
Prohibited aid measures
Motor industry The German authorities wanted to give Volkswagen aid of EUR 398 million forinvestment at two production sites in Germany.
The aid was additional to otheraid already authorised by the Commission. The Commission considered that apart of the additional aid distorted competition within the Community to anextent contrary to the common interest.
Thus, it adopted a partial negativedecision for an amount of EUR 123 million.
The Commission has always soughtto ensure that operating conditions in the motor industry are fair throughout Europe.
It allows the regions of eastern Germany to return to economicdynamism, and authorises aid accordingly, but is at pains to ensure that aplethora of public aid schemes does not harm other firms that are not receivingthem.
The effect of this balanced policy is to preserve competitiveness andemployment throughout the common market for the benefit of all thoseemployed in the motor industry.
And by dissuading public authorities fromgiving systematic assistance, the Commissioncontributes to reducing public expenditure and thushelps to lower the general tax burden.
SOME COMMON
QUESTIONS
This series of questions and answers on matters affecting the general public is designed to demonstrate the scope of competition law with reference to specific cases which ordinary citizens may encounter in their daily lives.
A merger between two supermarket chains is reported in thepress.
The new group will be the largest in the country and oneof the top three in the Union.
In my local area, there are onlytwo large supermarkets, each belonging to one of the twochains in question.
At the moment, there is keen competitionbetween the two supermarkets in prices and promotional offers.Am I right in fearing that, after the merger, this situation willchange and local competition will disappear?
If so, what couldthe Commission do?
It is likely that the merger will bring with itproblems of competition, particularly in areaswhere the two supermarket chains were the onlyones present before the merger. In these areasthe new group will probably hold a dominantposition, allowing it to set high prices or reducethe range of products on offer to consumers.
In this case, the Commission has the power toprohibit the merger if it has a Community dimension and leads to the strengthening of a dominant position.
The Commission may also accept the operation if the parties propose commitments that will restore competition, for example a commitment to sell certain supermarkets to viable competitors, particularly in areas where each of the two merging firms has a retail outlet. If the merger does not have a
Community dimension, the domestic competition authorities will as a rule have the power to take similar action.
This situation is illustrated by the Kesko/Tuko,
Rewe/Meinl and Carrefour/Promodès cases mentioned above.
What scope is there for buying a car in another Community country?
I have been looking for a car in a Community country of which I am not a resident, having learned from a Commission publication on car prices in the Union that there is a 20 %
difference in the price of the same vehicle depending on whether it is bought in my country of residence or in the other Member State.
My dealer has told me that I could not buy thevehicle abroad as the manufacturer forbids its dealers frommaking cross-border sales.
Is this possible? Is there a competition problem here?
If what your dealer claims is true, there is a realproblem, as such a ban would constitute a barrierto trade within the common market and theacceptance on the part of dealers that they willnot sell vehicles to non-residents would in principle amount to an agreement restricting competition within the commonmarket.
In 1998, the Commission imposed a hefty EUR 102 million fine on Volkswagen AG for banning its Italian car dealers from meeting orders from German and Austrian customers attracted by lower prices in Italy.
Petrol prices have increased at filling stations.
Is this the result of a restrictive practice?
Petrol prices went up by the same amount on the same day in allthe petrol stations in my region.
Is this price rise an example ofan agreement that restricts competition?
Should I complain tothe European Commission?
A simultaneous and identical rise in prices is not necessarily the result of concertedaction.
It may be the consequence of an increase in tax or in the price of crude oil,for example because of an international crisis.
Where there is no explanation of thiskind, it might be that the price rise is the result of an agreement between fillingstation owners or oil companies.
An investigation would have to be conducted todetermine whether or not this was the case.
If a simultaneous and identical riseoccurs locally, it is probably more appropriate to contact your domestic authoritiesthan to report the matter to the Commission.
For instance, at the end of November 1999, the Italian competition authority launched an investigation into asuspected agreement between petroleum-product manufacturers in the fueldistribution sector in Italy.
Prices have risen simultaneously inseveral Community countries — is this asign of a restrictive practice?
Every year I go on holiday to a Mediterranean island.
I usuallytake a ferry run by the Ulysses line, which offers the mostattractive prices of the three companies operating at the port in question.
However, this year I noticed that the fares had o
increased steeply and the three companies had aligned theirprices.
Is this the result of an anti-competitive agreement??
The combination of a price rise and the alignment of prices between the threecompanies —the only three operating at the port —would seem to indicateconcerted action by the three firms.
The price rise alone could be explained by anincrease in operating costs (rising fuel prices, renewal of fleet, new on-boardservices, etc.), but there is no objective reason why the overall costs of all threecompanies should increase concurrently and lead to an alignment of prices, whenthere was apparently keen competition beforehand.
There are therefore stronggrounds for presuming that the three ferry companies have agreed on this priceincrease and alignment in order to eliminate competition and make profits, to thedetriment of passengers, who have no other option to reach the island.
If several Member States are involved, it might be advisable to inform the European Commission.
Certain perfumes are on sale only in a perfume shop.
Whatever happened to consumer choice?
My wife asked me to buy a French perfume for my mother-in- law’s birthday.
I tried to find it in a supermarket, but the sales
¿ assistant told me it was sold only in perfume shops.
Are theexclusive rights enjoyed by these shops legal?
Although the European Commission is in favour of goods being available as widelyas possible at the best possible price, whatever the distribution network, it nevertheless accepts that certain goods are covered by special contracts reserving theirdistribution for retail outlets that meet a number of objective, qualitative conditions,for example the layout of the retail outlet or the presence of qualified staff capableof providing a particular service.
In the case of perfume shops, this service consistsof providing customer advice, enabling customers to test the products and givingout samples.
Such agreements are authorised because they are intended toimprove the distribution of goods.
If the supermarket is able to meet the objective criteria laid down by the perfume supplier, it would as a rule be in a position to sell its goods, but, in general, supermarket owners are unable to make the investments demanded by suppliers, particularly with a view to offering customers a product presentation and testing service.
In the face of redundancies, what justification is there for the Commission
declaring government aid illegal?
The Commission has declared illegal the government aid grantedto a firm where I am employed.
The firm is going to have to payback the aid to the government.
We fear that this decision maylead to redundancies.
I do not understand the Commission’sattitude.
The policy of monitoring State aid is often misunderstood, particularly by peoplewho suffer directly as a result of a Commission decision. Where the Commissionforces a firm to repay unlawful aid —with damaging financial consequences for that firm —the immediate reaction of the firm’s owners or employees will necessarily be negative.
However, the purpose of monitoring aid is not to undermine the viability of firms. On the contrary, the goal is to ensure that firms recover a lasting vitality.
The Commission condemns State aid which serves to delay the restructuring measures needed to restore firms’ competitiveness and to maintain artificially jobs that will soon disappear.
It condemns such aid all the more as it distorts competition vis-à-vis firms or regions which have carried out restructuring measures without the benefit of such aid.
Thus, aid granted to a firm in order temporarily to save its business and the jobs it provides may cause difficulties for several firms and thousands of workers that receive no government aid.
However, the Commission is in favour of aid for the restructuring of firms in difficulty, provided that it leads to the long-term restoration of the firms’ competitiveness.
How does the public benefit from theliberalisation of services of generalinterest?
When sectors previously under a monopoly are opened up tocompetition, does this not undermine services of generalinterest?
Private firms have different objectives from publicservices and I am afraid that the quest for profit may promptthese firms to abandon unprofitable activities or to be lessrigorous on matters of safety and public health.
What positiveeffects can the public eventually expect from liberalisation?
In some sectors, for example air transport and telecommunications, liberalisationhas clearly brought benefits to consumers, in terms of prices and the services on offer, without calling into question flight safety or access to telecommunications
X services in geographically remote areas.
Thesesuccesses are due to the balanced liberalisationpolicy pursued by the European Union, which notonly encourages competition between firms —thusguaranteeing competitiveness and cost savings —but also acknowledges the role of services ofgeneral interest in maintaining the economic andsocial cohesion of the Union.
Basic services such as compulsory education or social security are therefore excluded in principle fromthe liberalisation process.
The Commission also encourages Member States to setup watchdog bodies to regulate liberalised markets in order to prevent practiceswhich would harm intermediate and final consumers.
So the public has gained agreat deal from the policy of liberalisation: lower prices, a wider range of services,more efficient services and a guarantee of government scrutiny.
As a European Union citizen, you may in your everyday life encounter situations where there are signs of possible anti-competitive practices, such as those we have just described: simultaneous and apparently unjustified price increases, refusal to accept orders from customers in another Community Member State, etc.
If you find that competition is appreciably affected as a result, you may file a complaint.
Who do I complain to?
Member States, you may consider bringing a case under Community lawby referring the matter either to the European Commission, if it seems to concern several Member States (or even the whole Community), or to the domestic competition authorities or law courtsif it appears mainly to concern only one Member State.
Member States, you should contact the domestic competition authorities or law courtsonly, on the basis of the domestic competition law of the
How do I refer a case to the European Commission?
Once you have answered these questions, what course of action can you consider taking?
Basically, you have two choices.
You may contact the European or domestic authorities personally.
You may bring the problem to the attention of a consumer organisation.If the restriction of competition appreciably affects the common market, it is likely that the consumer organisation will already have received a number of similar complaints or letters.
It may then contact other national or
European associations and submit a duly substantiated complaint. It may file a complaint on behalf of consumers in the Union and establish the Community interest in the case.
For the sake of efficiency, both for the individual and for the
# authorities, it would seem preferable to choose this collective course of action.
When addressing a complaintto the European Commission, whether it be an individual or a collective complaint, a simple letterwill suffice.
It must contain the following information:
• the complainant’s name and address;
• the identity of the firm(s) in question;
•evidence of the complainant’s legitimate interest in the matter;
•a clear description of the subject matter of the complaint and a
% statement of the reasons for thinking that the practice in question infringes the rules of Community competition law.
# will the European Commission take?
Once it has received the complaint, the European Commission may act in one of two ways.
1.It may consider that the facts set out in the complaint give firm grounds for suspecting that there is an unlawful anti-competitive practiceinfringing the competition rules of the Treaty and itself launch an investigationto determine whether or not an infringement has taken place (‘own-initiative’ proceedings).
If the investigation uncovers evidence of an infringement, the
Commission, after going through the requisite procedural stages, will adopt a decision which may prohibit agreements, order an end to the offending
/ practices or impose fines.
2.After examining the complaint, the Commission may consider that the case does not constitute an infringement of competition rules or does not display sufficient Community interest.In the second case, the Commission may send the case file to the competition authority in the Member State where the effects of the practice are most felt, as the domestic authorities may be interested in pursuing the matter.

Welcome to this training manual!
This training tool was developed as part of the EU-funded project, `Capacity building of civil soci-ety dealing with anti-discrimination', with the aim to provide training on European and national anti-discrimination law and policy to non-governmental organisations in the 10 Member States which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 as well as in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
NGOs have a vital role to play in making anti-discrimination legislation understood and enforced on the ground.
They are essential in speaking on behalf of and defending those they represent as well as raising awareness, of both victims and potential victims of discrimination, who are all too often unaware of their rights, and also of the general public.
The manual was used by national trainers conducting national training seminars in each involved country.
Participants came from a wide variety of non-governmental organisations and associa-tions covering all grounds of discrimination ̌ racial and ethnic origin (including Roma), religion or belief, age, disability and sexual orientation.
The main purpose of this project (November 2004›October 2005) was to build up the capacity of civil society by improving NGOs' knowledge on the two EU anti-discrimination directives (2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC) and relevant national legislation and policies in this area.
NGOs were trained to become a key interlocutor of the authorities and to assist the victims of discrimination.
The project focused on three activities.
A stakeholder/needs analysis was carried out in each of the 13 countries to assess the capacity and extent of organisations representing civil society.
This analysis gave input to the training specifications and helped to identify the target groups for participation in the national seminars and their needs.
This information was based on the answers provided by the NGOs involved.
† Training the trainers
In each of the 13 countries, six local trainers were selected, some coming themselves from minority groups (for list see http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/ fundamental_rights/civil/civ_en.htm). Four `Train the trainers' seminars targeting the national trainers took place in March 2005.
Combating discrimination › A training manual seminars consisted of the training modules which can be found in this manual translated into national languages, and into some minority languages.
The material in this manual was designed for the recipients of the training.
We hope the material in this manual will be useful for individuals and organisations active in the fight against discrimination wherever they may be in the European Union.
Following the success of the training seminars in the new Members States and Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, the Euro-pean Commission has decided to fund a follow-up of this training exercise in all 25 Member States and in Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey in 2006 as well, to include also social partner organisations in these countries among the participants.
The project is a European Commission initiative funded by the action programme to combat dis-crimination (2001›06).
It was carried out by human european consultancy (www.humanconsul-tancy.com) in partnership with the Migration Policy Group (www.migpolgroup.com) and local partners in each of the 13 countries.
Key concepts in the training
Introduction to the European Union
The European Union (EU) comprises 25 Member States: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Swe-den and the United Kingdom.
There are, at present, two acceding and two candidate countries: Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Turkey.
The EU institutions
There are four principal institutions which are entrusted with carrying out the tasks of the EU.
A. Council of the European Union
‹ to pass European laws: in many fields it legislates jointly with the European Parlia-ment;
‹ to coordinate the broad economic policies of the Member States;
‹ to conclude international agreements between the EU and one or more States or inter-national organisations;
‹ to approve the EU's budget, jointly with the European Parliament;
‹ to coordinate cooperation between the national courts and police forces in criminal matters.
† Consists of representatives of the Member States at ministerial level (one representative per Member State) who are authorised to commit their governments.
B. European Commission
‹ to manage and implement EU policies (e.g. discrimination policies) and the budget;
‹ to enforce Community law (jointly with the Court of Justice); and
† Consists of one Commissioner per Member State, appointed by the governments for five-year terms, acting impartially and independently, with responsibility for a particular policy area.
For some more details of the Commission's actions in the field of discrimination see point 1.3 below.
† The Parliament has three main roles:
‹ to share with the Council the power to legislate;
‹ to exercise democratic supervision over all EU institutions, and in particular the Com-mission.
It has the power to approve or reject the nomination of all Commissioners, and it has the right to censure the Commission as a whole; and
† The monthly plenary sessions are held in Strasbourg (France) ̌ the Parliament's `seat'.
Parlia-mentary committee meetings and any additional plenary sessions are held in Brussels (Bel-gium), whilst Luxembourg is home to the administrative offices (the `General Secretariat').
† MEPs may not concurrently serve in a national government but may hold a seat in a nation-al parliament; they sit in multinational political parties.
† Committees are set up to deal with particular issues.
There is a Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, one on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and one on Civil Liberties,
Key concepts in the training
The Committee on Petitions responds to petitions submitted by individuals who consider that their EU protected rights have been violated (see `National context', Section 3.2, `Adminis-trative and legal channels for challenging violations of anti-discrimination legislation').
D. European Court of Justice (ECJ)
† Main court of the EU, based in Luxembourg.
† Consists of one judge per Member State, assisted by eight advocate-generals whose role is to present reasoned opinions on the case to the ECJ.
† Judges appointed by joint agreement of the governments of the Member States for renew-able six-year terms.
‹ requests for a preliminary ruling: if a national court is in any doubt about the interpreta-tion or validity of an EU law it may, and sometimes must, ask the ECJ for advice.
This advice is given in the form of a `preliminary ruling' (see further `National context', Section 3.2, `Administrative and legal channels for challenging violations of anti-discrimination legislation');
‹ proceedings for failure to fulfil an obligation: the Commission or Member States can initiate proceedings if they have reason to believe that a Member State is failing to fulfil its obligations under EU law (see further `National context', Section 3.2, `Administrative and legal channels for challenging violations of anti-discrimination legislation'); and
‹ appeals on points of law only against judgments by the Court of First Instance, which was created in 1989 to alleviate the workload of the ECJ, and which is also based in Lux-embourg.
† Decisions are reached by majority. There are no dissenting opinions; judgments are signed by all the judges who took part in the deliberations and are read in open court.
The EU must act within the limits of its powers as set out in the Treaties. The principle of subsidi-arity regulates the lawfulness of the exercise of competence: in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence (i.e. where competence is shared with the Member States) the EU can only take action if the objectives of that action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States.
The ECJ has held that the EU constitutes a new legal order for whose benefit the Member States have limited their sovereign rights, and that a nation-al court is under a duty to give full effect to provisions of EU law even if this means refusing to apply conflicting national law, whether adopted prior or subsequent to the particular piece of EU legislation.
† other sources: general principles of EU law developed through the case-law of the ECJ, and `soft law' (e.g. guidelines and resolutions).
T r e a t i e s
† Single European Act, 1986.
† The Treaty on European Union (of Maastricht), 1992.
Article 249 of the EC Treaty states:
A directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.
A decision shall be binding in its entirety upon those to whom it is addressed.
Recommendations and opinions shall have no binding force.'
† Directly applicable: come into force by virtue of their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, from the date specified in them, or in the absence thereof, from the 20th day following that of their publication.
† Do not require any national implementing measures.
† Can be relied upon in national courts by individuals.
† Enter into force either on the date specified in them or on the 20th day after their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
† But require domestic implementing measures within a certain time period from adoption.
† Member States must ensure that they adopt implementing measures before the expiry of the deadline so that national law reflects the terms of the directive ̌ this process is called trans-posing the directive.
† Member States can be liable for non-implementation or for imperfect transposition of a direc-tive (see further, point 1.6, below).
D e c i s i o n s
† But only on those to whom it is addressed, e.g. a company which has been found in breach of competition law.
Brief introduction to the Council of Europe
The Council of Europe was created at the end of the Second World War for the purpose of promot-ing European unity, protecting human rights and facilitating social and economic progress.
It has 46 Member States, including all EU Member States and candidate countries.
The Council of Europe created the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
The European Court of Human Rights is based in Strasbourg, and oversees the implementation of the Convention.
Article 14 of the Convention provides some protection against discrimination, as does the 12th Protocol to the Convention which entered into force on 1 April 2005.
At the time of writing this manual (April 2005), out of the 13 countries involved in the present project, only Cyprus has rati-fied and will therefore be bound by the 12th Protocol.
The concept of discrimination in EU law and policy
The principle of non-discrimination is a general principle of EU law.
It is also expressly mentioned in a number of distinct contexts in the Treaties.
The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights was solemnly proclaimed in December 2000 and is as of yet not legally binding.
It forms part of the new Constitutional Treaty, and if this Treaty has been rati-
Key concepts in the training fied by all 25 Member States, it will become binding.
`Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, dis-ability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.'
`Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty and within the limits of the powers conferred by it upon the Community, the Council, act-ing unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat discrim-ination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.'
This is not a direct prohibition, but rather an empowering provision which enables the EU to take action against the forms of discrimination listed (see `General principles' above).
Prior to these developments, there was extensive EU legislation and case-law on the prohibition of discrimina-tion on grounds of nationality and gender.
† A directive to implement equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (Council Directive 2000/43/EC).
† A directive establishing a framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation (Council Directive 2000/78/EC).
‹ to assist in analysing and evaluating the extent and nature of discrimination in the EU and the effectiveness of measures to combat it;
‹ to help to build the capacity of the actors in the Member States of the EU and at European level who are active in the fight against discrimination;
‹ to promote and disseminate to practitioners and opinion-formers the values and practices underlying the fight against discrimination.
The Progress programme 2007›13 will bring together a number of existing European programmes under one heading, including the anti-discrimination programme.
To discriminate means to differentiate or to treat differently when there is no relevant difference between two persons or situations, or to treat in an identical way situations which are in fact dif-ferent.
The two anti-discrimination directives, which provide the basis for this training, prohibit both direct and indirect discrimination and provide the same definition of discrimination.
Direct discrimination has occurred if one person is treated less favourably than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation, on any of the grounds on which discrimi-nation is prohibited.
The problem in establishing that direct discrimination has taken place is that it is not always easy to identify the `correct comparator'.
You need to find someone whose situation you can compare to the situation of the person who claims to be a victim of discrimination.
Only if these are in the same or similar situations can the comparison take place.
Sometimes it will be impossible to iden-tify an available actual comparator, and a case can then be made for a hypothetical comparator.
This should build on the treatment of a real person without the relevant characteristics (e.g. some-one from a mainstream religion as opposed to from a minority religion) in slightly different circum-stances.
However, once it has been established that two people in the same or similar situation have been treated differently, it would be hard to show that this difference was permissible.
The directives provide for certain narrowly and precisely drawn exceptions.
These include genuine occupational requirements, positive action, reasonable accommodation for disabled persons and specified exceptions for age discrimination.
For example, if an employer denies a worker a pay rise because of the worker's sexual orientation, and another worker in the same situation is given the pay rise, it is likely that this would constitute discrimination in violation of employment framework directive (2000/78/EC).
However, if a worker is denied a pay rise due to his age, this might be permissible under Article 6, which allows States to provide that differences of treatment on grounds of age shall not constitute discrimination if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.
Such differences may, according to the directive, include the fixing of minimum conditions of age, professional experi-ence or seniority in service for access to employment or to certain advantages linked to employ-ment (see more on this below).
The directives also prohibit indirect discrimination.
Indirect discrimination occurs where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons belonging to a protected group at a particular disadvantage compared with other persons.
This is so unless the provision, criterion or practice in question is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.
An example which has in the past often been given as a possible instance of indirect discrimination based on sex
The Member States need to put in place measures that are necessary to protect individuals from any adverse treat-ment (such as dismissal) as a reaction to a complaint or proceedings aimed at enforcing compli-ance with the principle of equal treatment. It is important that not only the person who has been discriminated against is protected, but also those who provide evidence as part of a discrimination complaint, or are involved in some other way in the complaint.
Definition of other concepts in the directives
Material scope of the directives
The employment framework directive (2000/78/EC), Article 3, protects against discrimination in the following areas:
† access to vocational guidance and training;
† employment and working conditions, including dismissal and pay;
She race directive (2000/43/EC), Article 3, provides much wider protection against discrimination and includes the following:
† access to employment, self-employment and occupation (including promotion);
† employment and working conditions, including dismissal and pay;
† social protection, including social security and healthcare;
† access to and supply of goods and services which are available to the public, including hous-ing.
Personal scope of the directives
The directives prohibit discrimination by natural or legal persons in the public sector and the pri-vate sector.
This means that an individual owner of a business has the same responsibility not to discriminate on any of the protected grounds as does a large private corporation, a municipality or a government department.
The directives protect individuals, that is, natural persons, against discrimination.
Additionally the directives provide that protection against discrimination should also apply to an organisation that has the status of legal person where the organisation suffers discrimination on grounds of the racial or ethnic origin of its members, where this accords with national traditions and practice.
The directives protect any person who is present in a Member State against discrimination on any of the prohibited grounds (racial or ethnic origin, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation and age) regardless of the person's nationality.
The directives specifically exclude discrimination on grounds of nationality, so that if dis-crimination is on grounds of being Romanian, or not being Hungarian, the directives would not apply (please see race directive (2000/43/EC), recital 13 and Article 3.2; employment framework directive (2000/78/EC), recital 12 and Article 3.2).
Key concepts in the training
There is also other EU legislation concerning the rights of certain non-EU citizens (third country nationals) who are residing working in EU Member States.
Exceptions to the prohibition of discrimination in the directives
As the purpose of the directives is to provide a framework for combating discrimination, the direc-tives permit discrimination only very exceptionally and only where certain tests are satisfied.
For all prohibited grounds the directives permit an exception to meet genuine occupational requirements.
Long-established assumptions about the type of person required to do a particular job may not meet the test of legitimate objective and proportionality.
For example, an employer is unlikely to be able to demonstrate that to work as a receptionist a person must be `young and energetic'; such a requirement is likely to be discriminatory on grounds of age and disability.
The employment framework directive (2000/78/EC), Article 6, permits, but does not require, Mem-ber States to include some further exceptions that would allow differential treatment on grounds of age including:
† setting special conditions on access to employment and training, on employment and occupa-tion, including dismissal and pay, for young people, older workers and people with caring responsibilities in order to protect them or to promote their vocational integration;
† fixing maximum age for recruitment, based on the training requirements of the post or the need for a reasonable period of employment before retirement.
Any such exception must still be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, which could include legitimate employment policy, labour market or training objectives, and the means of achieving that aim must be appropriate and necessary.
Positive action
The directives recognise that to achieve full equality in practice will require more than prohibiting current or future discrimination; therefore they permit measures to prevent or compensate for the historic disadvantages suffered by groups defined by racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, dis-ability, sexual orientation or age.
If particular groups have never been employed to do particular types of work, positive action could involve training people from such groups to prepare them for such work.
Reasonable accommodation for disabled people
The employment framework directive (2000/78/EC), Article 5, requires employers to take appropri-ate steps where needed in a particular case, to enable a disabled person to have access to, par-ticipate in or advance in employment or to undergo training unless this would impose a `dispro-portionate burden' on the employer. For example:
† after an accident at work a manual worker is unable to continue in his manual job; the employ-er could provide appropriate training and transfer him to an office job;
If, how-ever, the employer has offices only on the fourth floor and there is no lift, then there may be no reasonable measures (without disproportionate burden) the employer can take to enable this person to do this job;
An employer cannot claim that the burden, including financial burden, of providing reasonable accommodation for a disabled person is `disproportionate' if funding or other assistance is avail-able to assist employers in such circumstances.
Both directives provide that associations and organisations with a legitimate interest can support victims of discrimination or take legal action on their behalf (with their approval).
Criteria defining which organisations have a `legitimate interest' are established by national law.
The directives require Member States to promote dialogue with social partners to encourage workplace agreements, codes of conduct, and so on, and with NGOs with a view to promoting the principle of equal treatment.
The directives require Member States to take measures to publicise widely both their existing laws on equal treatment and non-discrimination and any new measures they adopt to bring their laws in line with the directives.
Member States must report to the EU on the application of the race directive (2000/43/EC) by 19 July 2005 and on the application of the employment framework directive (2000/78/EC) by 2 December 2005, and every five years thereafter.
In transposing the directives, Member States must ensure there are sanctions for infringement of their national anti-discrimination laws and that these sanctions are applied.
Sanctions for dis-crimination must be `effective, proportionate and dissuasive'; that is they should provide appropri-ate personal redress for the victim and should deter both the particular respondent and others from comparable acts of discrimination in the future.
Sanctions may comprise the payment of compensation, for which no upper limits can be imposed.
Recognising the difficulty of proving discrimination, Article 8 of the race directive and Article 10 of the framework employment directive provide for the shift of the burden of proof as follows:
`„ when persons who consider themselves wronged because the princi-ple of equal treatment has not been applied to them establish, before a court or other competent authority, facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination, it shall be for the respondent to prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment.'
In some Member States it will not apply to investigative procedures.
It is equally important to note that the shift of the burden of proof is not limited to court proceedings but that it extends to proceedings before any competent (i.e. administrative) authority.
The most frequently cited case in this regard is Enderby v. Frenchay Health Authority and the Secretary of State for Health, C-127/92.
There followed Council directive 97/80/EC on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex.
The shift of the burden of proof has been closely linked to the importance of delivering effective judicial protection against acts of discrimination.
The shift of the burden of proof which the directives allow is, however, not automatic.
The onus of proof does not shift as soon as a plain-tiff simply claims that they were discriminated against but only after they establish facts from which it may be presumed that discrimination has occurred.
What these facts might be is depend-ent on domestic legislation and case-law.
The directives refer to discrimination `on grounds of' racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, dis-ability, sexual orientation and age.
Case-law in countries like the United Kingdom and national legislation transposing the directives has generally clarified that `on grounds of' can include pro-tection against discrimination where the victim has the actual characteristics in question or is perceived to have such characteristics or is associated with persons having such characteristics.
For example, if someone is excluded from a restaurant because the proprietor says `No Roma' this is likely to be direct discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, whether the person is in fact Roma or whether their appearance suggests that they are Roma or because they are with Roma friends.
There are many procedural instruments that can assist victims of discrimination to establish that discrimination may have occurred.
NGOs in central and eastern Europe also use testers ̌ job seekers for instance ̌ who are selected to stand a comparison in all their characteristics, expect for the one (most often race) on the basis of which discrimination occurs.
Audio and video recordings can be used as evidence in some countries, for example, in the Czech Republic, but not in others.
In the United Kingdom the questionnaire procedure enables rejected job seekers to seek an immediate response from the employer as to the reasons for their rejection.
Both the race directive (2000/43/EC) and the employment framework directive (2000/78/EC) in their preambles expressly mention that statistics may be used in cases of indirect discrimination.
However it is generally held that the principle of direct effect applies only to complaints directed against a public body or `emanation of the State'.
As discussed above, States and in particular domestic courts are obliged to do everything possible to achieve the results outlined in the directives. Indirect effect therefore requires domestic courts to interpret existing national law, as far as possible, in line with the direc-tive that should have been implemented.
The role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in combating discrimination
What is a NGO?
A NGO is a local, national, or international group, with a legally established constitution, a clear purpose and visible activities with a governing body which has the authority to speak for its mem-bers.
It is normally a non-profit-making organisation, not affiliated with any government or private sector entity, or any political party.
When considering what role they can play in combating discrimination, NGOs should take full advantage of the special roles that have been given to them under Articles 7 and 12 of Council Directive 2000/43/EC, and Articles 9 and 14 of Council Directive 2000/78/EC.
In order for a country to achieve its goals of peace, democracy, good governance, health, prosper-ity and equality, NGOs are essential to successful development.
The role of NGOs as instruments of civil society in the fight against discrimination can include:
† providing a means for expressing and actively addressing the needs of people who are dis-criminated against;
† promoting diversity and equality in society;
Combating discrimination › A training manual
† work, where appropriate, in partnership with governments to achieve common aims and objectives;
† deliver services efficiently and effectively within the framework of government policies, where appropriate, and to adopt, where appropriate strategies consulted and negotiated between NGOs and government;
† deliver services efficiently and effectively outside the framework of government policies when this is necessary and appropriate to promote the NGO's objectives, and to adopt, where appro-priate, strategies contrary to government policies;
† be vigilant `watchdogs' ̌ pointing out where governments and corporations are actively dis-criminating, or failing in their obligations to combat discrimination or where they need to improve their performance, and serving to enforce the operation of checks and balances that characterise democratic society. In this role NGOs must target government and the business community by advocacy, lobbying and negotiating functions when required;
† keep track of and ensure that advantage is taken of all new developments in combating dis-crimination, for example, new legislation (national, EU and international), new policies (nation-al, EU and international), new sources of funding, and landmark judicial decisions (at both national, EU and international level);
In summary, the role of many NGOs can be to check, monitor and criticise the actions of govern-ments and private bodies, to supplement and complement the role of government in combating discrimination and to assist individuals and groups to assert their rights.
† accountability (NGOs have been at the forefront of debates regarding accountability and trans-parency ̌ key issues for voluntary action)
Why are NGOs better placed than other organisations to work towards combating discrimination?
† While disaffection with politics grows, engagement in voluntary and community activities is a way for people to contribute to public life by donating their time or money and supporting issues which are of concern to them.
What are the obstacles for NGOs and how might these be overcome?
† Complex rules surrounding the requirements that NGOs must meet in order to be registered.
The role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in combating discrimination
† Lack of standing in order to participate in relevant political debates. NGOs will need to be sure that they brief an individual or organisation that does have standing.
† Perception of affiliation to government or a political party threatening acceptance as an impar-tial advocate of issues. A good NGO needs to be careful to espouse a cause, not to be affiliated to a political party and steps should be taken to ensure that this is the case.
NGOs should ensure that they understand the importance of good organisational and financial management.
† Lack of funding and limited resources, lack of information and guidance on accessing available national, EU and international funds.
National equality commission, NGO coordination bodies, local EU representations and regional international donors should be contacted to identify suitable sources of funding.
† Tax/other relevant laws of the donor or recipient country that may not be supportive of NGOs.
For example, a considerable obstacle to the health and sustainability of the NGO sector in Japan is the fact that previously, Japan had not granted tax-deductible status to most of its non-profit-making organisations.
† Lack of effective `partnership' between government and NGOs.
Governments enact and enforce rules and regulations that define the policy environments needed for NGO activities to take root.
Combating discrimination › A training manual
† Inability to reach some parts of the community due to insensitivity, imposition of externally chosen legal or political aims, cultural or language barriers.
NGOs should ensure that their own organisations have a diverse workforce with personnel trained in discrimination awareness issues, awareness of the social and political history, including history of exclusion and discrim-ination of the groups within the community and, where relevant, a range of language skills.
† Poor management or employment practices occur frequently in NGOs and can damage morale and impede the effectiveness of the NGO.
Examples are lack or absence of an organised infra-structure or hierarchy, and/or in terms of the lack or absence of a management system.
This may be due to a number of factors including minimal funding, resources, time, resistance to taking on the role of employer, continuity of personnel (especially in an organisation where there is a high turnover of enthusiastic volunteers), low staff morale or downright chaos, and results in NGOs not reaching their full efficiency potential.
This can be overcome by agreed allocation of management roles, specific management training, competent internal adminis-tration and regular review of administrative and employment matters.

† For the participants to be able to restate the main principles of the directives, and the national implementing provisions, and to have critically assessed the impact the directives and the national implementing provisions have had/will have in their work.
Discrimination in the national context
Indirect discrimination occurs when an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would disadvantage people on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation unless the practice can be objectively justified by a legitimate aim.
† Also prohibits harassment, the instruction to discriminate and victimisation.
Victimisation occurs when someone is discriminated against for having made a complaint about discrimination or supporting a colleague who has made a complaint.
† Allows for positive action measures to be taken, in order to ensure full equality in practice.
For example, ethnic minorities may need special training and specific help to have a reasonable chance of finding a job.
The directives allow positive action of this kind to be undertaken and do not regard it as infringing the principle of equal treatment.
† Gives victims of discrimination a right to make a complaint through a judicial or administrative procedure, associated with appropriate penalties for those who discriminate.
† Allows for limited exceptions to the principle of equal treatment, for example in cases where a difference in treatment on the ground of race or ethnic origin constitutes a genuine occupa-tional requirement.
† Shifts the burden of proof between the complainant and the respondent in civil and adminis-trative cases, so that once an alleged victim establishes facts from which it may be presumed that there has been discrimination, it is for the respondent to prove that there has been no breach of the equal treatment principle.
The requirement that the burden of proof should be shifted, or shared, in this way is a recognition of two general aspects of discrimination cases.
The first is that those suffering discrimination are
Combating discrimination › A training manual rarely in a position to prove it.
The second is that only those who are accused of discrimination are likely to have access to the full facts of the case.
Although this shifting of the burden of proof is a recent feature of legislation in many countries, it is not new.
It has been widely adopted before as part of new laws on equality between men and women.
† Provides for the establishment in each Member State of an organisation to promote equal treatment and provide independent assistance to victims of racial discrimination.
She employment equality directive (2000/78/EC)
† Requires employers to make reasonable accommodation to enable a person with a disability who is qualified to do the job in question to participate in training or paid labour.
† Allows for limited exceptions to the principle of equal treatment, for example, where the ethos of a religious organisation needs to be preserved, or where an employer legitimately requires an employee to be from a certain age group to be recruited.
Have the directives been transposed into national law?
Malta has introduced a number of specific legislative acts to implement Council Directives 2000/78/EC and 2000/43/EC, in particular the employment and industrial relations act of 2002, the equal opportunities (persons with disability) act of 2000, and more recently Legal Notice 461 of 2004 which filled the lacunae there were in Maltese legislation with regards to discrimination on the grounds of religion or religious belief, disability, age, sexual orientation, and racial or ethnic origin in the field of employment.
The grounds of discrimination or discriminatory treatment are defined as follows under Maltese law.
'a) Race, place of origin, political opinions, colour, creed or sex are specifically provided for under the Constitution of Malta.
'b) Marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, sex, colour, disability, religious conviction, political opinion, membership in a trade union or in an employers' association, racial or ethnic
'c) Disability on the basis of physical and/or mental impairment under the equal opportunities (persons with disability) act, 2000.
We also find reference to discrimination in other legislation like the constitutional code, the criminal code, the press act and the broadcasting authority act.
Under the Constitution of Malta it is stated, in Article 45, that no law shall make any provision that is discriminatory either of itself or in its effect and that no person shall be treated in a discrimina-tory manner by any person acting by virtue of any written law or in the performance of the func-tions of any public office or any public authority.
In this article, the expression `discriminatory' means affording different treatment to different per-sons attributable wholly or mainly to their respective descriptions by race, place of origin, political opinions, colour, creed or sex whereby persons of one such description are subjected to disadvan-tages or restrictions to which persons of another such description are not made subject or are accorded privileges or advantages which are not accorded to persons of another such descrip-tion.
The criminal code does not provide any definition of the term discrimination or a description of those instances which may constitute discriminatory treatment.
Furthermore, to date the Maltese courts have not yet provided any such definition or description.
In addition, in its efforts to combat racism and xenophobia, the Maltese government has recently introduced a new provision in the criminal code by criminalising incitement to racial hatred.
Article 82A (1) provides that any person who uses any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or displays any written or printed material which is threatening, abusive or insulting, or otherwise conducts himself in such a manner, with intent thereby to stir up racial hatred or where racial hatred is likely, having regard to all the circumstances, to be stirred up shall, on conviction, be liable to imprisonment for a term of six to 18 months.
The only ground which is defined under Maltese law is the ground of disability under the equal opportunities (persons with disability) act, 2000.
This act defines disability as the physical or men-tal impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of a person.
This legal notice does not apply to alleged discrimination under any other legislation in Malta.
Assumed and associated discrimination
It is argued that this could be deemed to constitute discrimination by association.
Council Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC define direct discrimination as an action where one person is treated less favourably than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation.
Instead there is a list of those instances which are deemed to constitute discrimination under the act.
(1) A person shall discriminate against another person on the grounds of disability in any circum-stances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this act, if:
(a) in circumstances which are similar or not materially different, he treats or proposes to treat a person who has a disability less favourably than he treats or would treat a person who does not have such a disability; or
In fact it provides that a person shall discriminate against another person on the grounds of disability if that other person is required to comply with a requirement or condition with which the majority of persons who do not have the disability comply or are able to comply, and (a) which is unreasonable in the circumstances of the case; and (b) with which that other person does not comply or is unable to comply'.
Regulation 3(2)(b) provides that `indirect dis-criminatory treatment shall be taken to occur where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of a particular race or ethnic origin or having a particular religion or religious belief, disability, age, or sexual orientation at a disadvantage when compared with other persons.'
In fact, the same test which applies to Article 2(2)(b) of Council Directive 2000/78 to determine whether there has been indirect discrimination or otherwise, applies to Regulation 3(2)(b) of Legal Notice 461 of 2004.
Council Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC state that harassment shall be deemed to be dis-crimination when an unwanted conduct related to racial or ethnic origin takes place with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.
In this context, the concept of harassment may be defined in accordance with the national laws and practice of the Member States.
Under Maltese law, Legal Notice 461 of 2004, issued under the employment and industrial rela-tions act 2002, extended the protection from harassment in matters of employment on all the grounds mentioned in the two directives, and therefore now goes further than harassment on the ground of sex.
As against corresponding provisions of the directives, Regulation 3(3) of the said legal notice does not require that the effects of the harassment be cumulative.
Furthermore, Regula-tion 3(4) provides that a person shall also be deemed to have discriminated against another if the former neglects his obligation to suppress any form of harassment at their place of work or within their organisation.
Instructions to discriminate (Article 2(4))
An instruction to discriminate against persons on the grounds mentioned in Council Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC shall be deemed to be discrimination.
The equal opportunities (persons with disability) act, 2000, and the equality for men and women act, 2003, do not contain specific prohibition against the giving of instructions to discriminate.
Discrimination in the national context
Reasonable accommodation duties (Article 2(2)(b)(ii) and Article 5 of Directive 2000/78/EC)
Article 5 of Directive 2000/78/EC states that in order to guarantee compliance with the principle of equal treatment in relation to persons with disabilities, reasonable accommodation is to be provided.
Article 7 of the equal opportunities (persons with disability) act, 2000, provides that employers must provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities.
Article 7 of the act lists those instances in which an employer shall be considered to discriminate on the grounds of disability.
Such instances include, inter alia, if the employer unreasonably fails to make reasonable accommodation for the disability of such a person (unless the employer can prove that the required accommodation would unduly prejudice the operation of his trade or business), or if the employer denies employment opportunities to such a person and denial is based on the fact that he would be required to make reasonable accommodation for the disabil-ity of such person.
Therefore, failure by the employer to provide an employee with a disability, with reasonable accommodation shall constitute direct discrimination.
There is no requirement under Maltese legislation to provide reasonable accommodation to peo-ple discriminated against on the other grounds covered by the two directives.
To date, there have been no judicial pronouncements with regards to what constitutes `reasonable' accommodation or whether such accommodation imposes a `disproportionate burden' on the per-sons who are required to make such accommodation.
This is mainly because the KNPD try to avoid going to court by reaching an agreement. However, in spite of this, when all fails, it is inevitable that the parties concerned end up in court.
However, an indication as to what constitutes `reasonable' accommodation is laid down in Article 20 of the equal opportunities (persons with disability) act, 2000, which provides for the test of reasonableness.
Combating discrimination › A training manual tural, communication or transport barriers, or (c) the provision of auxiliary aids or services, regard shall be had as to whether such actions could be undertaken without unjustifiable hardship.
An employer shall be considered to discriminate on the grounds of disability in terms of the equal opportunities (persons with disability) act, 2000, if such employer without justification fails to make reasonable accommodation for the disability of such a person, unless the employer can prove that the required accommodation would unduly prejudice the operation of the trade or business run by such employer. Such failure results in direct discrimination.
In this case this provision goes further than that required by Article 11 of the employment equality directive since it does not only relate to breaches of the obligation of equal treatment but to any breach of the provisions of the act.
The wording of Article 28, particularly in the case mentioned in (b) above, appears to extend protection against victimisation to persons other than the complainant.
With regards to that which is provided for under Article 9 of the racial equality directive, as yet Mal-tese law does not specifically provide protection to individuals who may be subjected to adverse treatment or adverse consequences as a reaction to a complaint or to proceedings aimed at enforc-ing compliance with the principle of equal treatment, other than for instances relating to employ-ment which would be covered by Article 28 of the employment and industrial relations act, 2002.
Identification of any gaps which have been left by the transposition
It is to be noted that although there are certain provisions of the two Council directives which have still not been implemented such as for example in the case of the specialised body, there are no provisions which are in breach (that is, contrary) of the said directives.
With regards to those provisions of the directives which are, to date, not yet covered by Maltese legislation, one finds the following:
(a) Article 13 of Council Directive 2000/43/EC states that Member States are to designate a body or bodies for the promotion of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin.
This part of the legislation is still lacking in Maltese law even though it is envisaged that this shortcoming will be remedied in the near future.
(b) With regards to the provisions relating to (i) social protection, including social security and healthcare, (ii) social advantages, (iii) education, (iv) access to and supply of goods and services
Discrimination in the national context which are available to the public, and (v) housing, under Article 3(1)(e) to (h), Directive 2000/43, there is no specific legislation in Malta which prohibits discrimination in these matters.
Conse-quently, this means that there is no legislation in force in Malta which implements the provisions of Council Directives 2000/78/EC in relation to public service employees.
Are the participants aware of and familiar with the examination of national reports by the Committees of CEDAW, CERD, ICCPR and C o R o C as well as material from the ILO?
What have those Committees said about discrimination in the national context?
While the Government of Malta is committed to remove, in as far as possible, all aspects of family and property law which may be considered as discriminatory to women, it reserves the right to continue to apply present legislation in that regard until such time as the law is reformed and dur-ing such transitory period until those laws are completely superseded.
At its 1396th meeting, held on 23 March 2000, it adopted the following concluding observations.
The Committee, inter alia:
'a) welcomed the amendments to the press act, as well as the measures envisaged by the State party to amend the criminal code and the police force act, intended to cover aspects of Article 4 of the Convention;
'b) noted with satisfaction the amendment to the citizenship act which allows dual citizenship and entitles foreign spouses of Maltese nationals to be registered as nationals and the new law establishing procedures regarding refugees and asylum-seekers.
However, the committee expressed its concern that Article 4 of the Convention is not fully covered by the legislation and recommended to take into account all aspects of Article 4 in the elaboration of the new legislation and to review its declaration in relation to this article, made upon ratification of the Convention.
While noting that the legislation covered many aspects of Article 5 of the Convention, the commit-tee expressed its concern that the report did not sufficiently describe how the legislation is applied in practice and requested that such information be included in the next report.
It also recom-mended that following the claims of racial discrimination in housing, particularly as regards rental accommodation, this issue be addressed.
With regards to the police, the committee recommended that the necessary measures be taken to ensure that in cases where officers are found to have treated persons in a discriminatory manner in the course of their duties, in addition to disciplinary action, criminal charges be instituted against the police officers concerned.
Finally, the Committee recommended that the Maltese authorities take all appropriate meas-ures to ensure that the report and the concluding observations are widely distributed to the public.
Are they familiar with the possibility of `shadow reporting' (NGO reports that complement and where necessary correct the information provided by governments to these bodies) or of feeding information to larger NGOs for inclusion in their shadow reporting?
What opinion polls, if any, or comparable assessments have been taken to identify the extent of the impediment which public opinion will prove to be, to the effective implementation of the direc-tives?
Discrimination in the national context
Not much has been recorded to have been done.
Malta has focused its EQUAL programme into the four main themes listed below with specific attention being paid to the expected impact on the situation in terms of equality between men and women by ensuring that all EQUAL projects promote equality between women and men. The EQUAL NSS, through its set-up within the overall ESF intermediate body, ensures that no EQUAL project will overlap with any of the ESF's mainstream activities.
The four priority themes for Malta's 2004›06 programme are:
Maltese legislation lays down various courses of action that one may follow should an indi-vidual believe that they were subjected to discriminatory treatment.
Apart from recourse to action before the Civil Court, First Hall, sitting in its constitutional jurisdiction or the Constitu-tional Court, there exist other bodies where an alleged victim can address his or her com-plaint, depending on the nature of such complaint.
However, sub-section 2 of this section continues by saying that any submission to arbitration in regard to any dispute, which may not form the subject matter of a contract, whether absolutely or without certain formalities required by law, is null.
Its primary role is to give advice and to make recommen-dations to the Prime Minister in the making of appointments to public offices, in the removal of persons from such offices and in the exercise of disciplinary control over public officers.
The Commission derives its authority and functions from Articles 86, 92, 109›112, 114›115 and 121 of the Constitution of Malta.
In terms of Article 115 of the Constitution, the Public Service Commission is protected from legal proceedings in the sense that the question of whether the Commission has validly performed any functions vested in it by the Constitution cannot be enquired into in any Court of Law.
The Commission interprets its role to mean that it has a duty to ensure that recruitment into and all promotions or appointments within the public service are made in an equitable and impartial manner; are free from patronage and discrimination and are based on the principle of merit.
Furthermore, Article 30(4) states that any action taken by a complainant in accordance with the pro-visions of this article shall be without prejudice to any further action that such complainant may be entitled to take under any other applicable law and shall also be without prejudice to any other action to which the respondent may be subject in accordance with any other applicable law.
Also, the fact that the complainant is still entitled to bring an action under any other law, even after he has lodged a complaint with the Industrial Tribunal, is to the complain-ant's advantage.
As may be seen above, the time limit within which to lodge a complaint is not strict since the person who alleges that there has been discrimination has four months within which to lodge the complaint.
Costs in a court case are regulated by Article 1004 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure.
It states that costs shall be taxed and levied in accordance with the tariffs in Schedule A annexed to the code and with regulations made by the minister responsible for justice.
Instituting legal proceedings and the costs incurred during such proceedings can at times be quite high, thereby possibly creating a barrier to people who want to lodge a complaint.
Also, even though not really a requirement, it is advisable for a person to seek advice from a lawyer.
This commission is empowered to provide, where appropriate, assistance, including legal and financial assistance, to persons with disabilities in enforcing their rights under the act.
Article 75(2) of the employment and industrial relations act, 2002, also permits that action to be taken on behalf of a person who is the subject of alleged discriminatory treatment.
Also, in terms of Article 12(1)(j) of the equality for men and women act, 2003, the Commissioner for the Promotion of Equality, with the assistance of the National Commission for the Promotion of Equality for Men and Women, is empowered to provide assistance, where and as appropriate, to persons suffering from discrimination in enforcing their rights under the act.

Consequently, if the Industrial Tribunal is satisfied that the complaint is justified, it may take such measures as it may deem fit including the cancellation of any contract of service or of any clause in a contract or in a collective agreement which is discriminatory and may order the payment of reasonable sums of money as compensation to the aggrieved party.
Any person contravening the provisions of Arti-cles 28 and 29 of the employment and industrial relations act, concerning victimisation and har-assment shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine (multa) not exceed-ing MTL 1 000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and imprisonment.
Also, according to Regulation 9 of Legal Notice 461 of 2004, it is stated that:

Alerting the European Commission to discriminatory administrative practices
It is also possible to write directly to the Commission, which may often be a quicker process than petitions. This could be done with a view to encouraging the Commission to initiate infringement proceedings against the offending State.
The Commission and the Parliament are bound by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights' provi-sion on the right to good administration (Article 41).
† Every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a rea-sonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union.
‹ the right of every person to be heard, before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken;
‹ the right of every person to have access to his or her file, while respecting the legitimate interest of confidentiality and of professional and business secrecy;
Combating discrimination › A training manual
† Every person may write to the institutions of the Union in one of the languages of the Treaties and must have an answer in the same language.
`The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a nation-al minority, property, birth or other status.'
Collective complaints can also be made under the Council of Europe's European Social Charter.
It should be noted that the European Convention on Human Rights is part of our law through the European Convention act, Chapter 319 of the Laws of Malta.
NGOs should also ensure that they alert the committees which examine the State's periodic reports under the ICCPR, CERD, CEDAW and the Convention on the Rights of the Child to instanc-es of discrimination.
Everyone in a NGO who takes up the case of an individual or a group of individuals must be aware of the need to observe high standards of professionalism, including confidentiality and efficient management of case files.
For individuals whose cases the NGO is not able to assist with, the NGO should be able to provide relevant information and, wherever possible, referrals to another agen-cy that is able to provide further advice and support.
Identify the suspect groups and suspect situations in the national context ̌ the participants may wish to voice their own prejudices, or the prejudices they perceive to be prevalent, anonymously at this point ̌ moving on to more open discussion once the sensitive issues have been brought out into the open anonymously. The national trainers will decide whether this anonymity is neces-sary/appropriate.
Unlike several other minorities, gay and lesbian people are found in every strata of society, in one's family, in one's circle of friends, at work, etc.
Yet discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation is felt everywhere.
This was the first time that the highest representative of the local Catholic Church ever held an official meeting with a gay movement. In May 2003, a delegation from the Malta Gay Rights Movement met with the then Minister for Social Policy to discuss the lack of specific mention of sexual orientation as a ground of discrimination.
Consequently, the first specific mention of sexual orientation in relation to discrimination was introduced in Maltese legislation by virtue of Legal Notice 297 of 2003.
Though these steps are highly commendable given the socio-religious context prevailing in Malta, much still needs to be done.
One of the areas wherein no legislation has been introduced relates to the rights of same-sex couples.
Although there have recently been extensive amendments to the civil code of Malta in relation to personal rights, no specific rights were extended to same sex couples.
Thus, for example, the definition of `family' does not include same-sex cohabiting part-ners.
Also such couples do not have the same social benefits as married heterosexual people.
One of the most recent phenomena in Malta is the high increase in irregular immigration.
One can regularly hear the disparaging comments addressed by the man in the street towards persons who are detained as irregular immigrants or who have been granted asylum or refugee status.
Similarly, disturbing comments have been made in public by members of an extreme-right movement with respect to such immigrants.
Combating discrimination › A training manual
Another disturbing phenomenon is that several foreigners, particularly immigrants/refugees are being exploited by their employers and given inferior work conditions ̌ a convenient way to create cheap labour.
Certain press reports have indicated that some employers, especially in the construction industry, even go as far as reporting to the police on payday the immigrants that they themselves had employed illegally so as to avoid paying them.
There have also been reports of ill-treatment of refugees who had asked their employer for the payment of their wages.
According to the directive, Member States have to determine a period of time from the date on which asylum-seekers apply for refugee status, `during which an applicant shall not have access to the labour market'.
If a decision is not taken within one year of applying and the delay is not attributable to the applicant, Member States shall `decide the condi-tions for granting access to the labour market for the applicant'.
Job vacancy advertisements specifying the age of the preferred candidates are still published.
Furthermore, there are employers who, when carrying out recruitment, do not shortlist certain candidates simply because of their age.
Furthermore, incentives are given under
Discrimination in the national context the business promotion act regulations, 2002, to employers who train and employ persons over the age of 40.
Recognise, and ensure that those being trained recognise, that apparently liberal NGOs often harbour their own prejudices.
*** In this part of the seminar it is essential that the delegates from particular interest groups should be asked (in group work, see `Methodology' section) to identify suspect groups other than their own, and the problems they face.
*** Their findings should then be critiqued by the interest groups concerned with the rights of the suspect group in question.

Enlargement and cooperation
Soledad Blanco: “There are already positive changes.”
The European Union has reached full speed on the road towardsenlargement.
Soledad Blanco, who heads the unit in charge ofenlargement's environmental aspects, is hoping for a successfuloutcome to negotiations with the candidate countries.
the governments are listening a bit moreto whatthe public andthe environmental groups are saying,” argues Blanco.
Local authorities candidatecountries acceleratedtheirefforts to adapt their legislation to matchthe EU's, andby mid-December 2001the environmenttalks hadbeencon-cludedwithnine of the 13applicants.Buthas thatrapidprogress beenattheexpense of the European environment?
countries, and 2004is the target date forthe firstnew members tojoin. This is agoodtime totake stock of the workalreadyaccomplished, andthetasks still remaining – looking towards thefuture of environmental cooperation afterenlargement.
Althoughthe environmentnegotiationsare provisionally closed, this does notmeanthatthe EU or the candidate countries can rest ontheir laurels and wait foraccession to happen.
“No”, says Soledad Blanco.
As head of theunitresponsible for enlargement's environmental aspects in the European Commission, she has followedthe negotiations fromthe frontseat.
“There weresome very difficultissues, butthe outcome is satisfactory for all parties.
Ourpriorities have notbeencompromised,and atthe same time the EU has accept-edthat candidate countries needtime tobuildupthe necessary physical infras-tructure.”
Whenthe EUandagroupof candidatecountries firstsatdowntodiscuss environment in Decem ber 1999, representa-tives on either side of the table had quitedifferent ideas about the best results to beachievedfromthe negotiations.
Candidate countries, faced with having to tackle their serious environmental problemsbyup-grading environmental infras-tructure andlegislation, were aiming tosecure aseries of long transitional periods to ease the financial and administrative burden.
They were m e t with the Union 's firm determ ination to keep up EU standards andavoidenvironmentaldumping.
The EUwas especially keentoensurethat the candidates took on board majordirectives covering, for example, natureprotection, andaccess toinformationandenvironmental impactassessment,designed to increase public participationin environmental decision-making.
“Adopting EU laws is anecessary firststep, butwithoutpeople implementingandenforcing these laws, they are justpieces of paper. In other words, success increating ahealthier, safer environmentboils down to the qualifications and com-mitmentof the people working inenvi-ronmental administrations,”says Blanco.“According toarecentstudy(1)the mainfuturechallengeformanycandidatecountries will be the day-to-day handlingof tasks requiredby EU environmentallegislation.
Cities and municipalities willplay acrucial role, since mostenviron-mental legislation has to be put into practice at the local level.”
Finding acommonpathseemedaslowprocess, yet over the last year the negotiations gatheredspeedina way thatsur-prised eventhose involvedinthem.
Local authorities will, for example, beresponsible for issuing permits for industrial plants.
They have to be able to evaluate
Budapest: “Cities will play a crucial role.” requests, andthis oftenrequires highlytechnical knowledge.
Intheend, results have tobe reported to the Commission and also made available tothe public.
“The candidate countries contributedtothe Commission's Environment Action Programme for the next decade.(2) In 2002, mostof themwill also join theEuropean Environment Agency.
This willhelpthemtoset up monitoring systems,andwill inturnmake reporting onthestate of Europe’s environment a lot easier.They have alsoagreedtostartcontribut-ing to the Union’s strategy on sustainabledevelopment, so as to be includedinthe2003 synthesis report for discussion at the EU summit meeting in Spring 2003.
Andof course we wanttokeepthemuptodate on changes in our legislation.”
Beyond enlargement
“Environmentis perhaps the EU policywiththe largesttrans-border dimension:environmental decisions inone countryaffectthe environmentnotonly inallneighbouring countries, butalsoatregional andglobal level.
To meetglobalenvironmental challenges suchas loss ofbiodiversity or climate change, we willneedastrong partnershipwithregionssurrounding the Danube andthe Black Sea, and Russia, Ukraine andthe oth er Newly In depen d ent States.
These countries have immense environmental prob-lems butalsohuge natural reserves.
Forthis reasonwe are gradually extendingour environmental cooperationbeyondthe borders of the candidate countries:the future EU borders.” ❚
With the accession dates approaching, thefuture Member States are becoming moreinvolved in EU environmental policy.

"The candidate countrieshave valuable experience andexpertise – for instance in nature protection – thatcanonly en rich EU policy-making. Weshouldtake their views intoaccountwhen shaping policies.”
Howis this done inpractice?

Enlargement and pollution
Rescue call for the Blue Danube
Europeans have exploited the waters of the River Danube forcenturies, creating serious pollution and loss of biodiversity.Now, the European Union is backing international and regionalefforts to restore the Danube and Black Sea.
Manoela Georgieva, President of the International Commission for the Protection of the Black Sea, EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallström, and Stanko Nick, President of the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River.
Growing importance n1867, Joh an n Strauss wrote awaltzthatwas tobecome his mostfamous
composition: The Blue Danube. Sincethose days the music andthe river havebeeninseparably linkedinour imagina-tions: sunshine glimmering onthe bluewaves as couples sway elegantly tothewaltz …
These problems are hardly marginal, con-sidering thatthe Danube andthe Black Sea region con tain s thesingle, mostimportantnon-oceanic body of water in Europe – a basinthat covers one third ofcontinental Europe andaccommodatesover 160 million people.
The amountof nitrogenandphospho-rous reaching the Danube eachyear ishuge comparedtoother big Europeanrivers.
Today, more than100years after the Waltz King’s death, his melody lives on.But Strauss might notrecognise the riverthatinspiredhim, for die Schöne Blaue Donau, the ‘beautiful Blue Danube’, hasturned grey.
Furthermore, the Danube ’s strategicimportance to the EU will grow in future,withthe forthcoming enlargement.
Untilnow, the Danube has beenacrucial linkfor Central Europe as well as the borderbetweenthe EU andthe Balkans and Black Searegion.
Withenlargement, the Danube will be acentral axis of Europeandthe Black Seawill become acoastalarea of the Union.
Excessively highnutrientlevels usuallyleadtoeutrophication: over-enrichmentof water withorganic matter, especiallyalgae.
When the mass of algae degrades, itconsumes oxygenfromthe water, andinthe worst-case scenariothis leads totheextinction of other species and the loss ofbiodiversity.
The need for coordination
The river serves as a resource for drinkingwater, irrigation, industry, fishing,tourism, power generation, navigationand, unfortunately, alsoas adumpforrawsewage.
This increasing pressure hasleftits footprint: theregionof the Danube and the Black Sea, into which theriver drains after flowing for more than2,850 kilometres, is suffering fromsevereenvironmental and health problems.
Many threats
Inthe Black Seathis has already hap-pened.
The north-westernshelf, whichonce boasted a rich biodiversity, is now a‘deadzone’ inspring andautumn, whendemandfor oxygeninthe seais highest.Another problemis loss of biodiversitythroughover-fishing or arrival of non-indigenous species.
Suchenvironmentalfactors have reducedthe number of fishspecies available to Black Sea fishing communities by 77%, from26tosix, inthelast 20 years.
The list of threats to the Danube’s ecosys-temis long: highnutrient(nitrogenandphosphorous) loads, over-exploitationandlack of available water, changes inriver flowpatterns, contaminationwithhazardous substances such as heavy met-als and oil, accidental pollution, degradation and loss of wetlands…
International efforts tocounter damageintheregionsincetheearly1990sinclude two conventions for environmental cooperation: the International Convention for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) andthe Black Sea Conven-tion.
Strategies have beendrawnupandpollutionhotspots identified.
However,sofar there has beenlimitedinvestmentinpriority projects, andactivities havefailedtoreverse the situation.
This slowprogress is due mainly tolack of coordi-nationbetweendifferentinitiatives andlackof real investmentinpollutionreduction.
The mainpolluters include wastes fromcities andindustries, chemical fertilizers
“DABLAS will play arole as coordinatorand facilitator to create political commit-ment.
It will ensure that projects for pollution reduction and sustainable manage-mentof water resources andecosystemsare implementedinthe wider Black Searegion,” explained Stanko Nick, presidentof the International Commissionfor the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR).
The Commission wants to make sure thatall EU-fundedprojects inthe regiontakeintoaccountthe priorities set out in the Danube and Black Seaenvironmentalactionplans.
Itis equally vital toensurethatpolicies inotherareas, suchasresearch and agriculture, support the environmental protectionof the region.
The Commission will alsostrive toincreaseinvestments byinternational financialinstitutions suchas the World Bank or European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and bilateral donors,such as EU Member States, in the region.
A better future
On the same occasion, the ICPDR and theother major organisationfor water pro-tectioninthe region, the International Commission for the Protectionof the Black Sea, signed an agreement to cooperate oncommonstrategic goals.
Manoela Georgieva, the president of the Black Sea Commission, saidthe time was righttoimprove the state of the sea for good.
> The Danube river basin covers around 2 million sq. km: one third ofcontinental Europe.
> The greater Black Sea basin is home to more than 160 million people.
> Every year the Danube pours about 350 cubic km of water into the Black Sea.

High-level signs of increased cooperationalready exist.
Atthe endof November2001, the ministers of the Danube and Black Sea countries signed a joint declaration in Brussels.
> Enlargement and the econ om y Bringing home the benefits
Enlargement will have some very positive environmental side effects: cleaner air, good-quality drinking water and safer waste managementacross Europe.
In short, better quality of life for millions of people – a good reason to achieve higher environmental standards.
Prague: lower air pollution will reduce damage to buildings.
O about the current EU enlargement is:
“How much will it cost?” industry, fishery, agriculture andtourism– are alsodependentonhighqualitywater resources.
expected to reduce the number of cases ofchronic bronchitis by between43,000and 180,000 cases, while tighter emissionscontrols will helptoavoidsome 15,000-34,000premature deaths. For example,better air quality couldsave 7,000-14,000premature deaths in Poland alone.
Knowing thatfor the 13 candidate countries the economic consequences of accession will be significant, an honest answeris: alot.
Inthe environmental fieldtheestimated bill for just the ten Central and Eastern European candidate countries tocomply with EU requirements amountsto80-110 billion.
This mightlook like bitter medicine toswallow, butthere is more toit.
A recent independent study(1) shows that the long-
Impurities in the air do not only harm thehumanbody: blackenedandcrumblingwalls inour cities demonstrate the dam-aging power of pollution and acid rain.

termbenefits of thecureforpublichealthandthe economy are likely toberemarkable.
City-dwellers are notthe only people toenjoy the benefits of cleaner air: less sul-
Many candidate countries are still facingproblems withwater supply bothforhouseholdandindustrial use.
Noteveryhouseholdhas running drinking water,and water quality gives cause for concern– contaminationby microbes, leadandpesticides is notrare.
Implementing the EU water directives across the candidatecountries will tackle these problems.
Tenmillionnewhouseholds will have drinking water ontap, andit will be of higherquality, minimising potential healthproblems.
Fewer people will needtobuybottledwater, boosting family budgetsanddiminishing the amountof wasteproduced.
For example, the Bulgarian wheatharvest could grow by 5% in a few years if EU standards are applied.
Sohow muchare we talking about?
Thestudy estimates thatthe total value for all 13candidate countries couldrangefrom134to681 billionfor the peri-odof 1999-2020.
The Czech Republic isexpectedtogainthe most: the benefitscouldamountto232-702per capita(see Info Box).
The main reasons are lower air and waterpollution and better waste management.
Air knows nofrontiers, andreduced pollution from the candidate countries couldalsobring public healthbenefits wortharound 6.5 billion annually to existin g EU Member States.
Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia can also look forward to cleaner air thanks to their neighbours.
Better water quality
For industry, better water quality meanslower production and maintenance costs,as equipment will nolonger be damagedby dirty water.
Cleandrinking water is vital tohumanlife andis often viewed as a basic humanright.
But many sectors of the economy –
As air pollutiondecreases, sodoes thepopulation's risk of falling ill with respiratory diseases, suchas bronchitis or asth-ma.
This is particularly important for vul-nerable groups suchas children. Fullimplementationof EU air legislationis

Companiessave time and money whenthey donothave toapply for separate permits foreachof their operations.
Another advan-tage is that EU directives establish a com-mon set of environmental rules all acrossthe Union.
Like everywhere in Europe, economicdevelopmentandrising consumptioninthecandidatecountries arecreatinggrowing amounts of waste.
Landfill sitesare the mostcommon methodof wastedisposal, and controls are needed to stopthemfromgrowing evenlargerandmore hazardous. Badly managed– orintheworstcaseillegal – landfills canthreatenecosystems andhumanhealthas heavymetals ortoxins leak intotheair and soil.
The first step is toassess what kinds of benefits are available in general (e.g. reduction in respiratory diseases).
The second step is to estimate howlarge these benefits are (e.g. how many cases will be avoided).Finally, the monetary value of the benefits is evaluated (e.g. howmuch would the damages avoided be worth).
The benefits are estimated using several methods, for examplecalculating the“avoided damage”: the reduction in cases of asthma or use of primary materials.
Another method is by analysing“willingness to pay”: the value people place on living in a cleanerenvironment.
Thebenefitstudyestimates that, in Poland, the EU landfill directive will helptoincrease the amountof waste thatisrecycledandcompostedby over 10 mil-liontonnes per year.
This will be a hugeimprovement, given that 98% of Poland'smunicipal waste currently goes into land-filling.
In countries like Malta, where landis a scarce resource, smaller waste volumeswill release more space for development.
Boosting business
The benefit study outlines the real impactof enlargementfor the candidate countries andfor Europe as a whole: the costsof better environmental protectionaresignificant but, clearly, so are the benefits.The study alsoshows thatpeople inthecandidate countries value these benefits –environmentmatters tothem.
This is areal incentive to strive for better environmental protection.
Withthe EU environmental directives, candidate countries arealready halfway down the road.❚
The figures span a very wide range, simply because it is extremely difficult, for example, to measure the impact of air pollution. Inthe same way, it is almost impossible to give a monetary value toa human life.
For these reasons it would not be scientifically honest to mention just one precise figure – the benefits must be seenas general estimates.

Better managementfor coastal zones
Adopted last year, the European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management isdesigned to look after coastal areas in the European Union.
The European Commission istaking steps at EU-level to implement the strategy, but these steps need to be complemented by local, regional and national action inside Member States.
ho is concerned about coastal zones?
❚Having a long-term perspective
Implementing the European strategy
❚Ensuring flexible managementas part of an ongoing process
❚Reflecting local needs
❚Working with natural processes
❚Involving all the stakeholders
Implementation implies the need for actionatlocal andregional levels, designedaccording tolocal andregional condi-tions.
Inthis respect, the EU cancon-tribute best by encouraging andsupport-ing local actors throughthe supply ofinformation, including informationcon-cerning best practice.
❚Mobilizing the support andinvolvement of all relevantadministrative bodies
❚Using a combination of instruments including fishers andaquaculture producers, the energy industry, shippers andports operators, the tourismtrade, localresidents… andanyone else whousescoastal areas andtheir resources.
Withsuchawiderangeof activities, theresources of our coastal zones are underconstantpressure.
As thephysical andbiologicalresources of the coastal zones degrade,the opportunities for sustainable economic activityarealsoreduced, andsocial conditions decline.
The European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management
Financing for innovative actions relatingtocoastal zones is available th rough the LIFE - Environment Programme, as well asinthe context of INTERREGIII.
In parallel, the EU's researchframework programme is supporting scientific projectstoprovide the informationneededbycoastal zone planners and managers.
Andthe Directorate-General for the Environment has recently published a study eval-uating the socio-economic benefits of ICZM, andis abouttolaunchamajorproject related to coastal erosion.
Toaddress these problems, the Commis-sionlastyear an n oun ced a European strategy for promoting better management of the coastal zones.
This strategy isbasedaroundaseries of principles for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM):
❚Taking a broadapproach(thematicallyand geographically)
As well as offering this specific informa-tiontocoastal zone managers, the Com-missionhas producedabookletfor thegeneral public explaining the challengesand objectives of Integrated Coastal Zone Management .
This EU focus oncoastalzonesbookletis available inall EU lan-guages, anda video onthe coastal zonesis also planned.
Experience gleanedfromthe Commis-sion's demonstration programme on Integrated Coastal Zone Management, whichran from 1996 to 1999, helped to identifythese principles.
This programme high-lightedthe factthatmany of the prob-lems of coastal zones canbe tracedbacktoinstitutional issues suchas alack ofcoordination between the various authorities and actors responsible for local man-agement.
As another componentof the strategy,the Commissionis working toimprovethe coherence andconsistency of the many EU policies thataffectcoastalzones.
The upcoming revisionof the Bath in g Water Directive, as well as therevision of the Common Fisheries Policy,both offer opportunities for promoting anintegratedapproachtothe coastal zonesof Europe.
Development of nationalstrategies
The Commission 's dem on stration on ICZM illustrated the importance of stake-holder participationin good coastal zonemanagement.
So, while important, actionby the administrations is notenough.
Inorder tofindsustainable andequitableapproaches tothemanagementof acoastal zone, all of the major coastalresource user-groups inthe area needtobe involved: the fishers andaquacultureproducers, the energy providers, the ship-pers andports operators, the tourismindustry, the local residents, the tourists...and you?❚ mentissuedits Opinionon5July, sup-porting the proposed Recom m en dation , but callin g for several amendments.
On29October, following work under boththe Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, the Council reachedpolitical agreementonits Com m on Position on the proposal.While the twotexts are largely compati-ble, there remainafewpoints of diver-gence between the Parliament and Council versions, most notably concerning the Parliam en t's amendments mentioning afuture ‘Community legal framework’ (ordirective).
Neither the Council nor the Commission believes thatsuchalegalframework would be effective.
The entiretext will therefore go for a second readingin Parliament, withthe hope that a com-promise canbe agreed withoutthe needfor a formal conciliation process.
Text by Anne Burrill
All of this action at the EU level, however,needs tobe complementedby actiononthe groundinthe Member States.
For this reason, the Commissionhas pro-poseda European Parliam ent and Council Recommendationtoinvite the Member States toimplementthe principles ofgoodcoastal zone management, throughthe development of national ICZM strategies.
These should be based on a stocktak-ing of the mainactors, laws andinstitu-tions thatinfluence the managementoftheir coastal zones.

Towardsa New Approach
Why it matters for Europe?
As a first step the European Commission, in consultation with various stakeholders, identified a number of important current Societal Challenges for the European Union.
These will be addressed by the 2010-2013 Work Programmes and, as examples, include “Changing the role of the financial system to better serve economic, social
The Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities (SSH) Theme of the Cooperation Specific Programme (SSH, 7th Community Framework Programme for Research and Development, 2007-2013) addresses key societal, economic and cultural challenges facing Europe and the world now and in the future.
The Societal Challenges will be complemented by a number of more targeted ‘traditional’ research topics.
It makes a significant contribution to promoting shared understanding across Europe and to the resolution of wider international problems.
and environmental objectives”, “Creating and adapting jobs in Europe in the context of a socioecological transition” and “Europe facing a rising multi-polar world”.
Each Challenge will be addressed by a specific Set of Research Actions that will be combined in a single large scale integrating project.
Future project proposals thus should now pay attention to:
It helps improve the formulation, implementation, impact and assessment of policy including regulatory measures in many Community policy areas at the European, national, regional and local levels.
A coordinated interdisciplinary approach and plurality of perspectives to examine the different dimensions of the societal challenge considered;
Building on previous research; stock-taking;
The SSH programme funded research, combined with the bottom-up activities of the European Research Council (Ideas Programme), and strategy-oriented Joint Programming actively contribute to the development of the Lisbon and Ljubljana processes.
Forward looking /foresight analysis regarding the evolu- tion of the societal challenge, where relevant;
Deployment of a significant international cooperation dimension in addition to the European dimension;
Dissemination and exploitation of research results in a va- riety of contexts (scientific, policy, media, civil society);
Development of an effective critical mass of actors, in- volving a wide range of key stakeholders.
A rigorous professional approach to managing research and day-to-day administrative work.
Ethical and gender dimensions will continue to be rele- vant in both the conduct of the research and its content.
For comprehensively addressing the Challenges, proposers are encouraged to define additional research aspects that go beyond the research areas identified in the Work Programme.
The projects involve several thousands of researchers from more than 1500 organisations (Universities, Research Organisations, Stakeholders, Research Funders, etc.) in over 70 countries which makes the programme the largest SSH targeted programme in the world.
These Societal Challenges have to be addressed by pooling resources, achieving critical mass and However, efforts need to be continued to ex-developing coherent and complementary research ploit the full potential of these research coop-activities.

The new approach will be implemented as of the 2010 Call for proposals as a pilot exercise.
In subsequent calls the number of Societal Challenges per call will increase in proportion with the rise in the general budget for the SSH programme.

Preparing (potential) candidate countries for tomorrow
Developing close relationships with countries seeking to join the European Union is of the utmost importance. e Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) is a new facility aimed at assisting candidate countries and potential candidate countries in their efforts to better understand how the Union works and adapt national policies, rules and regulations in preparation for membership.
e IPA combines, under one umbrella, EU programmes and pre-accession financial instruments, and provides more f l flexibility to beneficiary countries to tailor assistance to their needs while allowing for improved coordination with stakeholders, Member States and international financial institutions.
In this issue of Panorama, the spotlight is on two IPA components managed by the Directorate-General for Regional Policy: crossborder cooperation and regional development. e former seeks to promote cooperation between the authorities on each side of the borders shared by EU Member States and candidate/potential candidate countries. e latter is designed to support investment in fields such as infrastructure development in the same way that regions within the Union are supported under the European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund.
For the first time, pre-accession assistance has been planned and implemented in a more strategic way over several years, thereby ensuring a continuous and uninterrupted f l flow of funds for core investment projects.
IPA thus allows beneficiary countries to become acquainted with how such actions are implemented in the Union for the day when, as full members, they would benefit from the EU's Cohesion Policy.
In this edition of the Inforegio Panorama magazine, we highlight the different ways that beneficiary countries are managing and implementing projects financed by IPA and its predecessor ISPA, as seen through the eyes of the representatives of the countries themselves as well as experts from the Commission.
I believe that this is an important mutual learning exercise both for existing Member States and the Union's future members.

Enabling candidate countries to develop through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance
As European Enlargement continues apace, assistance given to Candidate Countries is becoming increasingly sophisticated.
In this article we look at how the original pre-accession assistance has taken on new dimensions.
Croatia, like all candidate countries, can use EU assistance for environmental projects.
This broader framework gives candidate countries much more scope to develop their own economies and institutions and therefore the skills of their entrepreneurs and administrators.
Pushing the boundaries further
Pre-accession assistance has previously focused on institutional building and investment in key areas of Community policies.
Investment was implemented through the Instrument for
Assistance to candidate countries through pre-accession funding moved up a gear from 1 January 2007, when all the related EU programmes and finance initiatives were replaced by a single measure – the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)1.
The programmes covered previously by Phare, Phare CBC, ISPA, SAPARD, CARDS and the financial instrument for Turkey delivered important benefits, but the process of managing them and keeping each initiative in step with the others has become simpler for all concerned.
Not only this, but national authorities are much more closely involved and with a greater degree of responsibility for strategic planning and
(1) e legal basis for this assistance is Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006, adopted on 17 July 2006.
More detailed implementing rules are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 718/2007 of 12 June 2007.
Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA), a projectoriented instrument focusing mainly on investments in the areas of transEuropean networks and the environment.
candidate countries will benefit for the first time from financing to cover activities that are similar to activities financed in EU Member States and regions under Cohesion Policy instruments.
A significant share of IPA funds managed by the DGs for Regional Policy and Employment are allocated to Lisbon-type expenditure (roughly 15 to 20 % of the overall programme allocation, depending on the country).
e five components of IPA
Funds are allocated through five components: I Transition Assistance and Institution Building; II Cross-Border Co-operation; III Regional Development (transport, environment and economic development); IV Human Resources Development (strengthening human capital and combating exclusion); V Rural Development (rural development-type measures).
A good example is the Regional Competitiveness Operational Programme in Turkey, where the bulk of the funding is dedicated to Lisbon-type programme, (programme budget for 2007-09 €187 million with a 75 % Community contribution).
Projects which will be financed under the programme include the creation and upgrading of industrial infrastructure, facilitating access to finance, promoting R & D usage, developing innovation and technology, demand-driven consultancy services and networking.
Seeing the benefits of IPA
So far, perhaps the most impressive results of IPA were achieved during the preparation of the Operational Programmes.
While the Strategic Coherence Frameworks (which are similar to the National Strategic Reference Frameworks prepared by Member States) were developed under the leadership of central government authorities, the programmes were drawn up by the competent line ministries in close consultation with regional authorities and stakeholders and civil society representatives. Alongside these
Components I and II are open to all beneficiary countries of the Western Balkans and Turkey.
Components III, IV and V are open to candidate countries only (namely the Republic of Croatia, the Republic of Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Their design mirrors closely the management and programming principles of structural, cohesion and rural development funds.
Thus, IPA allows beneficiary countries to participate at an early stage in managing these Community Cohesion Policy instruments.
By gaining first-hand experience at running these programmes, they will be well placed to absorb future structural, cohesion and rural development funds once they become available to them.
Regional Policy and enlargement, moving up a gear through pre-accession funding core programming tasks, IPA also enabled national bodies to develop skills in financial management and control.
Croatian environmental projects
In this relatively short period (programme preparations and negotiations took less than a year), essential preconditions and principles for successful implementation were agreed.
These include programme ownership, concentrating assistance on core sectors and disadvantaged regions, and ensuring that programmes complemented other funding instruments and promoted partnerships among stakeholders.
A quick look at some of the projects financed under IPA Component III demonstrates their diversity as well as their strategic importance.
Major infrastructure projects are being financed under the Croatian Environmental Operational Programme.
Here new facilities are being financed for solid waste and waste water that fully respect relevant EU environmental standards.
For instance, modern solid waste management centres are planned for the town of Split (Lecevica) where a landfill site, transfer stations, recycling and a mechanical and biological treatment plant are to be constructed.
The total project cost is estimated at €68 million.
New waste water treatment plants and upgrading of sewerage networks are also programmed for the towns of Slavonski Brod, Knin and Drnis.
The total project costs are estimated at €27 million and €18 million respectively.
Investment aid in candidate countries is only a fraction of the level of investment assistance available to Member States2, but it places a strong emphasis on building institutions and structures for the future.
It gives business leaders and civil servants a crucial experience in devising and managing investment projects, preparing them for the time when they take on full control of Structural Fund programmes.
Balikesir Solid Waste Management project aims at reducing the pollution of groundwater and environment in Balikesir and surrounding villages and to increase reuse and recycling by establishing a Regional Solid Waste Management System for Balikesir, Bigadiç, İvrindi, Kepsut, Pamukçu, Susurluk and Savaştepe, in accordance with the acquis and the Turkish Legislation.
The project will serve a population of approximately 444 000 inhabitants
IPA funds are also available to potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans such as Bosnia and Herzegovina.
(2) Overall IPA allocation for the current financial framework 2007-13: €11.5 billion 2007-09, for example, Croatia receives on average €34 per capita per year of Community funds under IPA, while Bulgaria receives €110 per capita from Structural Fund programmes.
Regional development: an important step towards EU membership for the Western Balkans
December 2005 marked an important milestone for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on its path to becoming a European Union (EU) member – the European Council awarded it the status of ‘candidate country’.
This heralded the progress made by the country and opened new doors, giving it access to the five components of the instrument for pre-accession assistance.
This has enabled the country to take an active role since 2007 in building its future as a stakeholder in regional policy.
Road construction activities in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
As a result of the Regional Development component of pre-accession assistance, a precursor to the Structural and Cohesion Funds, a strategy document has been developed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
This comes in addition to an operational programme that defines the needs and priorities of the country, following the example of the current 27 EU Member States.
The first major project concerns building a new motorway section between Demir Kapjia and Smokvica along the No 10 corridor. This will mean the completion of the transEuropean network between Salzburg and Thessalonica, opening the country up further, which is a requirement for regional integration.
The project has a total budget of €155 million which is made up of contributions from the EU, Greece (in the form of a bilateral donation), the European Investment Bank (via a loan) and the state.
This strategic planning and sectoral programming has given national authorities the opportunity to take responsibility for social and economic development in cooperation with civil society.
One of the main objectives of the Regional Development operational programme is to contribute to sustainable development and the regional integration of the country into the Western Balkans.
Community aid will be concentrated initially on the transport and environment sectors – regional competitiveness is not expected to be incorporated until 2010.
e second project involves giving the 75 000 inhabitants of Prilep a reliable sewerage system and a waste water treatment facility.
Its resources in terms of soft water and biodiversity make the country one of the principal natural reservoirs of the region.
Heavy pollution caused by non-treated waste water, as well as non-treated urban and industrial water, is however a real threat for sustainable development and the quality of life for the inhabitants.
Considerable investments on the part of the public sector will be necessary to be able to cope efficiently in the coming years. e cost of the first project is rising to nearly €20 million, co-financed by the EU to a total of €6 million, the rest covered by a national contribution.
Considering the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over several years and despite the level of effort that needs to be maintained, this period of pre-accession gives rise to real prospects for the country’s future in the European family and more specifically in regional policy.
Aside from putting in place administrative structures for managing and monitoring European funds, the national authorities are currently managing two major projects financed by the operational programme. ese projects are a real test for the country as they involve the application of EU standards and practices on a large scale and in several domains – from environmental impact analyses to donor coordination.
Over recent years, the importance of supporting and encouraging crossborder cooperation for Europe’s regions has been recognised more and more widely.
Border regions suff er from a number of specific disadvantages compared to more central regions.
They are usually less well developed and often face geographical or demographic challenges; moreover, their economic sphere of influence and development potential very often run into legal, administrative, economic and cultural barriers caused by the border itself.
These factors are particularly acute along the European Union’s external borders.
IPA crossborder cooperation programmes with EU Member State participation
MALTA candidate or potential candidate countries on the other.
Secondly, it supports crossborder cooperation between candidate and potential candidate countries themselves.
Finally, the component may also support the involvement of candidate and potential candidate countries in transnational cooperation programmes under the Territorial Cooperation Objective, in particular the south-east Europe and Mediterranean programmes.
Cooperation has long been a key component of EU Cohesion Policy, firstly through the INTERREG Community Initiative, and now via the European Territorial Cooperation Objective.
One of the Instrument for Pre-Accession’s main roles is to help ready candidate countries for implementing Cohesion Policy, hence the logic behind the IPA also having a crossborder dimension.
At the same time, using the IPA to deliver crossborder cooperation in the new programming period is also designed to resolve some of the administrative difficulties that cooperation along the EU’s external borders has faced in the past.
is article focuses on the first of these elements, which will support up to 12 programmes between the Member States and (potential) candidate countries (see map).
Most of these programmes are already up and running, and the first call for projects has already been completed for the Slovenia-Croatia programme
Strictly speaking, the IPA crossborder component supports three types of co-operation.
Firstly, it funds crossborder cooperation between Member States on the one hand and
Regional Policy and enlargement, moving up a gear through pre-accession funding from the countries concerned, is responsible for running the programme, supported by a Secretariat staffed from both sides of the border.
Moreover, all projects must have partners from both sides of the border and will be selected jointly by the participating countries, not by the Commission.
In contrast to these fundamental changes to the organisation of crossborder co-operation, the content of the programmes may seem less radical since it builds on the successes of crossborder cooperation elsewhere in Europe. e programmes offer support for economic and tourism development, social and cultural links, environmental protection, transport development, and small-scale infrastructure.
On one level therefore, the benefits of these crossborder cooperation programmes seem obvious.
Project partners from the border areas concerned will receive funds allowing them to work together with their neighbours and to run projects delivering results for the economic and social development of the local populations.
Two European zoos in Hungary and Serbia co-operate to enhance education and environmental protection.
Most of the programmes are relatively small, land-based programmes owing to the political geography of the region. e (major) exception is the Adriatic programme, which will receive over €200 million up to 2013 and involves eight countries.
A new, more radical approach to Crossborder Cooperation
However, crossborder cooperation is not, and cannot be, simply about the local level.
By working together in their common border regions, countries can address challenges that transcend political borders.
Flood prevention is one such area, where flooding on one side of the border may have its root causes on the other side.
In addition, some local-level projects may have links to national and European policy issues.
In this context, projects related to the Roma people, or to shared river basins like the Danube and Tisza, could be developed in the IPA crossborder programmes and might have an influence far beyond the local, crossborder area.
It is difficult to underplay the radical nature of the crossborder component of the IPA.
Firstly, the funds for each programme are allocated per programme, not per country. is resolves one of the major disadvantages with EU external border cooperation programmes in the past – the difficulties involved in coordinating different sources of funds inside and outside the Union.
Finally, there is another layer of benefits that should also be taken into account – these can be described as the institutional benefits for the (potential) candidate countries.
By participating in these programmes, the national and local authorities in these countries can gain experience in the implementation of Structural Funds-type programmes, including participation in Monitoring Committees, project selection procedures and the establishment of financial control and audit systems.
Conclusions e first quarter of 2009 will be a key period for the IPA crossborder programmes.
Most of the programmes will hold their official launch events, along with Monitoring Committee meetings, in order to raise the profiles of the programmes in the border regions and begin the process of attracting project submissions.
It will be important to maintain visibility for all the programmes at this crucial stage.
Excluding them from crossborder cooperation would have been a very negative and counterproductive signal to send out.
As a result, all the countries concerned will benefit from being part of programmes implemented under a Structural Funds approach even before they become candidate countries for accession to the Union.
e IPA crossborder programmes form a strategic dimension within EU pre-accession assistance by providing a learning framework for (potential) candidate countries in their preparations for implementing EU Cohesion Policy.
is is the third main innovation of the crossborder component of the IPA.
In line with the aim of using these programmes to prepare for future Structural Funds implementation, the IPA crossborder programmes will mirror Structural Funds rules as closely as possible. is means firstly that the programmes are run on a multiannual basis.

Building a cleaner future
As Bulgaria reaches towards its future within the EU, funding under the structural policy for pre-accession is helping one town modernise its environmentally contaminating waste disposal and water systems.
Panorama travels to Ruse, Bulgaria's largest port on the Danube (pop. 160 000), to look at how over €40.5 million of support from the EU is helping the town comply with standards in water supply and waste treatment and consign dangerous and obsolete infrastructure to the past.
Waste water from one of the town's outflows being discharged into the Danube in Ruse, Bulgaria.
Waste water and wasted water – twin problems
When water does flow from the domestic tap, it will have travelled through approximately 447 km of fracturing, crumbling pipes, 64% of which are constructed from asbestos cement.
"Our key problem is that the whole system was built in the 1970s and has not been upgraded since – it is simply worn out," explains Sava Savov – the manager of ViK, the town's regional water company: Water Supply and Sewerage Ltd.
e Danube flows past the Bulgarian town of Ruse, bringing with it trade, visitors and cultural exchange – much as it has done since the Romans first settled here.
When it flows away from Ruse it takes not only barges and cruise ships with it – but also the entire town's untreated sewerage.
From the vantage point of one of the town's outflows, discharging around 240 000 litres a second, 'Blue Danube' seems to be a misnomer.
All this is set to change by the end of 2010, when the results of Bulgaria's most extensive water project take effect.
Benefiting from 75 % EU co-financing, (€35.1 million) under the EU's Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession (ISPA), Ruse's Integrated Water Project will allow the town to comply with two key EU water directives: those governing urban Waste Water Treatment and Drinking Water.
It will deliver: new, more efficient pumps; 10 replacement hydrophores ensuring constant supply to the town's high-rise buildings;
Regional Policy and enlargement, moving up a gear through pre-accession funding e plant is designed to meet EU standards in accordance with modern best practice and the current design is for an aeration plant with an anaerobic sludge digestion system.
20.5 km of replacement pipe for mains supply; renovation of the pipes most prone to leaking; an extended distribution network and a completely new sewerage system and treatment plant.
Turning waste into power
Now manager of ViK, five years ago Savov was the head of a technical unit trying to keep the town's failing sewerage system going: "I remember we had a blockage and I went down into the collector to clear it.
It took two days of intensive work to clean it out and I was sick for a week – headaches, stomach ache – the lot. e fumes from the untreated waste water are so toxic", he said, as we watched one of the town's 11 collectors turn the Danube's waters brown as it discharged its contents.
Eight steps separate out the sewerage into treated water and sludge – these include mechanical processes, such as varying levels of filtration and biological treatments involving the balance between aeration, the use of anaerobic micro-organisms and the use of settling tanks.
Ammonium will have been oxidised to form nitrate which will then be reduced into elementary nitrogen and the phosphorus precipitated out.
By the time the process is complete, carbon, phosphates and nitrates will have been eliminated and clear, processed effluent will flow into the river while the remaining sludge will be collected and subjected to further treatment.
Once air dried and subjected to four phases of anaerobic treatment, the sludge ends up in a digester tank where the resulting methane produced will be collected and stored in a 900 m2 gas holder.
From there it will fuel a biogas power plant and heater offering combined heat and power.
e Integrated Water Project runs from 2005-10, and the funds being invested will turn the waste that is currently degrading the Danube into an alternative power source.
is continual flow of untreated domestic and industrial sewerage will cause the town to fall foul of the EU's Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment, which comes into force in 2010.
To address this, one of the key elements of Ruse's Integrated Water Project will be the complete overhaul of the sewerage system.
Eleven collectors will be rationalised into one central collector which will direct the waste into a state of the art treatment plant, putting an end to a centuries old practice of uncontrolled discharge.
Drinking water – uninterrupted supply of cleaner water

But it is not only the environment which is set to benefit from the scope of the project – the population's health will be improved, drinking water resources preserved, jobs created and the flood risk minimised.

Regional Policy and enlargement, moving up a gear through pre-accession funding technology. e whole programme of construction works was laid out considering the weather conditions and the water table under the Danube, as well as the agricultural needs of the community since most of the pipeline is laid out in the fields around Ruse.
Further up stream, at the town's water source, the first pumping station already has a new pump up and running.
With a capacity of 500 litres a second and 25 % more energy efficient, the pump is run on 6 000 volts – 75 % of the company's monthly €153 640 electricity bill is spent on supplying Ruse and the 100 000 households that make up the urban conurbation.
"No one body could have taken on an operation of this size", said Savov, "what you are seeing here is the result of cooperation between the Ministry of Regional Development who have a directorate handling the ISPA funding process, the three consultancies helping the Municipality manage the project and then there's ViK itself – the water company.
Once this is completed, the town will be free of supply problems and the dangers of contamination", he added.
It is clear that having witnessed decades of underinvestment and the resulting struggle to hold the whole system together, Savov is personally touched by the developments and the help the town is getting: "You want to know how I feel at seeing all this change, such large-scale investment coming in?
I feel, for the first time, truly European."
A new mains transmission pipeline will improve the supply of clean water once installed.
While 71% of the financing will go to modernising the sewerage system and building the treatment plant, the rest will be set aside for improving the supply of clean water.
Outside the town, work has begun on replacing the 20.5 km of mains pipes leading from the town's water source to its second pumping station – previously two trunk water supply pipelines, one part constructed in the mid 50s and made from asbestos cement and the other made from reinforced concrete built in the late 60s. ese are in very poor condition, a factor worsened by lower water levels caused by leaks and inadequate pumps – the pipes are exposed to more friction when the levels of water inside them are low.
As the water project gets fully underway, another major infrastructure project is being signed off.
Where before there were no landfill sites that complied with EC regulations in the area, the new landfill site that covers Ruse and four other municipalities in the region, is now up and running. e project received just over €5.5 million from ISPA and resulted in the closure of 18 tipping sites and subsequent improvement in the management and control of the area’s waste, specifically: improved reuse and recycle ratios; more organised collections and transportation; environmentally aware disposal, preventing the leaching of contaminants into the water table and the Danube, and improved monitoring.
With a total capacity of 2 337 000 m³ and a lifespan of 22 years, the site, 3 km outside Ruse, has three cells for non-hazardous, domestic waste giving a total capacity of 1 819 726 m³ (and room for the construction of another two).ere are two more for inert waste, typically coming from the construction industry, with a total capacity of 121 955 m³.
Two further cells have been especially constructed for the storage of hazardous waste and have a total capacity of 1 500 m³.
e contract was awarded at the end of 2007 and 5 km out of 20 have already been laid. "e pipes are of differing lengths and each stretch is computer modelled to make sure the fit is perfect", explained Mr Harazim.

into the water supply.
At a well constructed landfill site, such as Ruse’s, what ultimately comes out of the system are cleaner solids, which then go back into the landfill, and harmless water which is discharged into the sewerage system.
Whereas once Ruse was an industrial town, transport and logistics are currently the town's main focus: it is building the biggest industrial park in Bulgaria.
Foreign investment is pouring in; a French hypermarket chain is set to open a branch in the town by the end of next year.
A 5 000 seater sports and entertainment venue, a new five star hotel and trade centre are all under construction, fruits of Bulgaria's biggest Public Private Partnership project.
"But it’s not just about neutralising, it’s about utilising as well," said landfill manager Plamen Kanazizov, "We are setting up a full-scale recycling section to extract metal, glass, plastic and paper with two different systems to deal with domestic and construction waste."
His advice to towns planning their waste disposal systems and landfills is clear: "It’s all about the lifespan of the site, eventually it will fill, the battle is about doing everything possible to extend the site's use as far as you can through recycling the waste wherever possible."
Ruse – EU funding buys enough time for the town to put itself back on its feet e new sense of optimism can be seen on the streets.
When asked about her feelings on the town’s future, 26 year-old interpreter Lachezara Raykova says: "I went to Veliko Tarnovo University to study English and interpretation in 2005 and I thought I'd come back for a few months after graduation, just to decide where to go next.
I thought I'd have to move to Sofia to get a job and develop personally."
But, when she came back, she was pleasantly surprised, the town offered far more than she had expected: "Here I am still.
I have work, there is tourism, there are visitors.
I have no intention of moving, I am happy here."
Ruse, proud of its record for using EU funds transparently, is finally enjoying economic growth, a turn around for a town which suffered from mass emigration in the mid 1980s due to nearby chloride emissions from Romania.
"Everybody was leaving", said the town's mayor, Bojiday Yotov.
"When the democratic changes came about in 1989, we inherited an economic mess.
If enough bright young professionals of her generation feel the same way, it will not just be Ruse's future that will flourish. flourish.
As one walks around Ruse, placards announcing projects that have been partially funded by earlier pre-accession instruments are in evidence – Phare money has gone into the small business sector and regional development and ISPA has been fundamental in getting the two, key infrastructure projects discussed, off the ground.
Although starting up while Bulgaria was still a candidate for accession, the projects continued as planned, after the country had become a member of the EU.
It was not only the status of the country in its relation to the EU that underwent a change – the funding instrument changed its name, becoming the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA).
And with the name change came a different focus; it now combines infrastructure investment with measures to enhance competitiveness, innovation and job creation.
It is certainly clear that EU funding has stopped Ruse's continued slide into economic stagnation, and emigration caused by a lack of hope – driven home by a crumbling infrastructure. e boost to morale such projects have bought the city have inspired the municipality to reconsider the future – for the mayor the source of prosperity is clear, “Our great strength has always been our location,” Yotov explains.
A port and a major axis of communication, Ruse gradually attracted foreign and domestic investment and turned itself around.
Now its unemployment rate is 3.15% which is even lower than the capital, Sofia. a.

Championing economic growth in Croatia
Update on the Croatian Regional Competitiveness Operational Programme 2007-09
Many challenges and discoveries lie on the road to EU Accession.
The economic and structural developments that accession economies have to achieve put them all on a steep learning curve, but this process generates economic strengths that stand the test of time.
The Republic of Croatia is a good example of a candidate country facing up to the challenges of accession.
Croatia started the accession negotiations in October 2005 and, providing all pre-accession criteria are met, is hoping to complete the process by the end of 2009.

At the heart of this regional investment is the Regional Competitiveness Operational Programme (RCOP) 2007-09. e aim of the RCOP is to build social and economic cohesion within the country, and develop institutions that can cope with multiannual investment programmes and the future management of the Structural Funds. ree divisions within the Croatian Ministry of Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship are responsible for implementing the programme.
A closer look at the Regional Competitiveness Programme ree priorities govern the RCOP.
Two of them relate to investment and horizontal measures to bring the
From 1990 onwards, Croatia took major steps to adapt to a functioning market economy. is was a great starting point, but there was still a long way to go to meet EU economic targets.
Income levels lagged too far below the EU average and growth rates were variable.
Socioeconomic difficulties remain an issue, along with new environmental standards to meet.
To tackle these issues and other challenges, Croatia is benefitting from the financial assistance provided under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). e IPA programme, available since the beginning of 2007, consists of five components.
For Croatia, it is the third component (IIIC) covering regional development and competitiveness which is particularly crucial and projects worth €35.35 million are scheduled for 2007-09.

e legacy of the 1990s investment climate. ese goals will be met more easily and quickly by improving national administrative efficiency at the same time, encouraging cluster development and establishing e-business centres throughout the country.
e war in the 1990s inevitably caused severe infrastructure damage and, on top of this, the 1990s saw the downfall of the large state-owned enterprises. e legacy of this enormous upheaval has been that many parts of the country are lagging behind the economic standard they need to achieve, with poor growth among SMEs. ese areas need much better business support systems, such as business zones, incubators, technology transfer centres and other targeted services, to stimulate business growth and foreign investment. ere is also great potential for tourism-related infrastructure in these regions.
Some of these measures have already started under previous EU assistance, when the CARDS programme financed a series of projects and paved the way for a grant scheme for business related infrastructure under Phare in 2005.
A further dimension of this priority is focusing on technology transfer and creating the right infrastructure and services to bring new products to the marketplace.
Here public institutions are having to get to grips with entrepreneurial skills and managing intellectual property issues.
One such project is the creation of a Biosciences technology commercialisation and incubation centre (BioCenter). is exciting development will provide wide-ranging infrastructure for technology and knowledge-based products and SMEs.
BioCenter, which will be located on Zagreb university campus, will also play an important role in bringing the University closer to the market.
It will act as a direct facilitator of university/industry cooperation and prepare scientists and students for careers as entrepreneurs or in industry.
Investment Priorities e End Game e first investment priority therefore focuses on building infrastructure in 10 of the least developed counties, combined with human resources investments to strengthen the underlying business environment.
In this last phase of pre-accession, Croatian SMEs are generally still finding it difficult to maintain competitiveness.
Unless this is dealt with now, such weaknesses could repeatedly crop up in the brave new world of the Single European Market.
So, the second priority under the RCOP is all about ensuring effective business support at all levels, creating a positive
Once implementation on the ground takes off , the RCOP will provide overall coordination for many projects that continue to transform the Croatian economy and its integration into the EU Single Market.
Every part of the economy has to pull together to achieve this if financing through IPA is to be effective.
Ultimately, these goals can only be achieved through a combination of national and EU initiatives, where all available sources of funding are used to maximum effect. ect.

Within these regions, there is a strong focus on the 15 Growth Centres which have been identified in the Strategic Coherence Framework.
A map of the Programme area is given below.
Regions supported under the RCOP ree key priorities apply to every programme:
Projects under this priority involve creating a better business environment, to increasing the number of new enterprises, enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the existing enterprises increasing employment opportunities.
Priority 2: Building business capacity and entrepreneurship e aim here is to improve company efficiency and value-added, while enhancing their entrepreneurial capacity and increasing employment and overall regional competitiveness. is will encourage SMEs to adopt a more entrepreneurial culture and help them to take advantage of external support for sound ventures, with planning that addresses present and future business needs.
e aim of the support within the framework of the RCOP is to increase the competitiveness of the Turkish economy to converge with the economy of the EU and to reduce regional socioeconomic disparities. e principle is clear, but the task is huge, so limited resources have to be very specifically targeted for maximum impact.
A limited number of sectors, regions and priorities are selected and all programmes are set up on closely defined parameters with ongoing monitoring of results.

e Right Approach For e Right Region
A vast amount of detailed preparation has gone into drafting the RCOP and its implementation.
It has been difficult, but all the pieces are now in place for some exciting economic developments, as well as providing the tools for evaluating future projects under the IPA.
Where competitiveness is low, projects will concentrate heavily on promoting basic infrastructure, entrepreneurship and start-up, consultancy and financial support, together with interregional and interinstitutional partnership activities.
Tourism projects will be a further tool for boosting businesses.
More information:http://ipa.stb.gov.tr ese areas will also benefit from better networking between projects and businesses, to share common marketing strategies or production processes, for example.
In regions with medium levels of competitiveness, projects will focus on building institutional structures, business consultancy services, product development and creating partnerships within regions and between them.
Where partnerships between sectors show potential for business growth, these will be encouraged if they are not anticompetitive.
Tourism projects will again be a tool for business development.
In regions with high competitiveness, the measures are targeted at increasing added value, and coping with

Getting ready for IPA – the accreditation process of the management and control systems in Croatia
Nicola Aimi, DG Regional Policy
In 2005 Croatia was informed of the intention of the EU to launch IPA and thus replace the existing pre-accession assistance programmes from 2007.
Since then, Croatia has been actively preparing for management and implementation of funds within IPA.
Throughout the whole process, intensive and close cooperation was established with the relevant services of the European Commission.
Advisory missions were carried out to provide assistance to the Croatian authorities in building up the necessary institutional, management and control capacities.
• assigning responsibilities at institutional and individual level taking into account the need for adequate segregation of duties (in particular as regards internal audit and external audit functions).
Overall, these challenges have been successfully tackled.
Croatia is no stranger to the euro and soon Zagreb will be managing its own IPA funds.
e conclusion of the verification audit is that the overall system for the management and control of IPA program is compliant with the requirements.
When compared to the situation at the time of the advisory missions in 2007, significant improvements have been made in the areas of staff planning and recruitment, establishment of legal framework at all levels, preparation of detailed internal rules of procedures and verification procedures.
e main challenges that the Croatian authorities had to face in their progress towards accreditation were the following:
• procedures for accreditation and conferral of management of EU funds under decentralised systems are new,• the EU’s strict requirements in relation to designing and implementing sound financial management systems,

In the context of the INTERREG III A crossborder Adriatic New Neighbourhood Programme (2000-06), the ASVILOC project brought together local economic development agencies, local public bodies and SMEs from Italy, Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia. e project aimed at creating and supporting cooperation between SMEs and their syndicates, thereby fostering socioeconomic renewal and stimulating the integration of crossborder regions in terms of innovation, co-operation, internationalisation, company modernisation and staffturnover.
In addition, the crossborder cooperation sought to increase the role and capacity building of the local economic development agencies in the countries taking part.
e region of Homolje (municipalities of Žagubica, Petrovac na Mlavi and Malo Crniće) is cooperating with partners from Romania (municipalities of Sokolovac and Karas Severin County) to improve and expand tourism on both sides of the Serbian-Romanian border. e crossborder cooperation project is primarily focused on developing and using common tourist promotion activities in rural and ecotourism.
Other potentially attractive tourist destinations include cultural monuments such as the different monasteries located in Homolje.
Organising events with its Romanian counterparts provides Homolje with an opportunity to boost its tourist potential, generate economic growth and gain knowledge on how to effectively promote tourist activities in the region.
Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – leading the way in crossborder cooperation
Cooperation in the remote mountain regions near the Bulgarian-FYROM border has already been successful.
evidence of a new stage in maintaining closer links between the two countries.
Crossborder cooperation (CBC) projects have proved their worth over a long period and a new generation of projects is now taking shape under the provisions of the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) 2007-13.
CBC projects are based on a big vision for building wider European cooperation and integration which will in turn achieve sustainable development in border regions. e main priorities are economic development, social cohesion and improving the quality of life.
By reducing regional imbalances people benefit on both sides of a border and the regions become stronger overall.
e first programme to be approved by the European Commission on 14 December 2007 was between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Its proactive approach reflects the joint work of the teams in the partnering countries, excellent coordination and the determination to overcome all the challenges along the way.
Key facts and figures figures is big vision is backed by a programme budget of €7 756 038 including €6 592 632 EU funding and €1 163 406 national co-financing from both countries.
e programme is partly a logical continuation of existing relations developed through the EU External Border Initiative in 2003 and continued through the Neighbourhood Programme.
A snapshot of the Neighbourhood Programme
A wide variety of projects were successfully implemented under the Neighbourhood Programme.
Here are just a couple of examples among many.
Aside from the formality of the measures, it’s encouraging to think of real people coming together from different organisations and communities with common goals to achieve.
No future without sustainability
An integrated project ‘No Borders Required’ ran between the municipalities of Simitly and Karbintsi.
Joint activities were introduced in the sphere of health protection and improving the quality of life of young people in the crossborder region.
It is a lasting example of integrated work carried out by both local authorities.
Economic gains by themselves would be hollow if they did not also ensure sustainable growth and the preservation and development of natural and cultural resources, which constitute key assets in this border region.
Sustainable projects have a particularly bright future in the tourism sector, where new business opportunities can also offer sound green credentials.
Another project called ‘The Mountains Are Joining Hands’ delivered sustainable benefits through new ways of managing and developing natural, cultural and historic resources.
It ran between the municipalities of Dupnitsa and Kriva Palanka and upgraded the complementary project of RILA and Kochani.
On 13 March 2008 in Kyustendil, Bulgaria the first Joint Monitoring Committee meeting was held.
Fifty-three participants attended the event, ranging from local to national authorities involved in the programme to socioeconomic partners and potential project applicants.
e real start of the programme – the first call for proposals – will be launched during the last quarter of 2008, when applicants will be able to send their project proposals to the programme secretariat in Kyustendil.
e programme aims to improve living standards through wider participation in economic and social activities and increase incomes in areas that are often very remote. e programme will also be supporting projects in crossborder economies, where new investment holds the key to growth in priority sectors that benefit all the local communities.
In a nutshell, the partner countries expect their collaborative projects to generate new economic activities and diversification in the whole economic area. e area covered by the CBC programme is 18 736 km2, with a population of 1 065 605 inhabitants along both sides of the border.
e success of the projects, and ultimately of the programme, is in the hands of local people and depends greatly on the will of professionals to do things together and have a joint vision of their future.
Economic development, social cohesion and improving the quality of life are the main priorities of crossborder cooperation projects.
Communicating Cohesion Policy together – inaugural meeting of the INFORM network
On 17 June 2008, 120 communication officers from each Member State and several Territorial
Cooperation and networking programmes met for the first time in the context of the INFORM network1 coordinated by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Regional Policy.
The network, open to communication officers responsible for information and publicity on the ERDF and Cohesion Fund, aims to foster the exchange of good ideas, learning from the experiences of others and creating common tools, where needed.
One hundred and twenty communication officers from the 27 Member States met on 17 June 2008 in Brussels of the first meeting of the INFORM network.
Less formally, the network may also be expanded to include all communication officers who are responsible for developing and implementing communication plans and interested in sharing their experiences.
In total, the network is expected to have over 300 participants.
Representatives from other network platforms (e.g. INTERACT, INTERREG IV C, EPSON, URBACT II) are also being invited to play an active part.
To facilitate everyday communication between INFORM’s members, an internet forum has been set up2.
e network’s composition is twofold: the core group comprises one representative per Member State, usually from the central body responsible for coordinating ERDF/Cohesion Policy. e core group’s key tasks will involve conveying information about publicity and communication activities in the Member States as well as sharing the latest communication tools and exchanging information gathered from meetings held with the national networks of communication officers in each country.
INFORM’s core members will also be invited to attend networking groups addressing specific topics.
(1) Plans to set up the INFORM network were announced in Panorama 21:http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/panorama/pdf/mag21/mag21_en.pdf (2) e forum is for people involved in communication actions on Cohesion Policy.
To register, please visit:http://forums.ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/inform/
How to measure the impact of your actions?
e aim of this workshop was to share experiences and discuss evaluation issues, e.g. opinion surveys.
Two presentations – French experience, presented by Marie Gariazzo (IFOP Study Director), Yves-Marie Cann (IFOP poll expert), and Bertrand Millet (Communication Officer, national ERDF technical assistance programme), and Eurobarometer survey on the
European citizens' perception of Regional Policy, presented by
European citizens' perception of Regional Policy e meeting’s purpose was for members to get to know each other and discuss current and future actions.
One representative per Member State – a member of the INFORM core group – presented the latest accomplishments in one of the following fields: current efforts to publish data on the final beneficiaries of projects; organisation of launch events for new Regional Policy programmes; new publicity products, e.g. TV advertisements.
David Yormesor (DG Regional Policy) told participants about the setting up of a specific network for UK communication officers under the initiative of the Commission Representation to the UK. All presentations, testifying to the broad variety of actions undertaken and the prevailing atmosphere of enthusiasm and ideas, are available online3.
Participants agreed that measuring the impact of EU activities and also the effectiveness of publicity measures via public surveys is one of the most objective methods5. e surveys, accompanied by analysis, also draw lessons for the more efficient promotion of EU structural interventions.
Communicating projects – how to present them attractively to the media and the public
Ronald Hall (Director, Directorate-General for Regional Policy) stressed how conveying the benefits and impacts of EU Cohesion Policy should not be viewed as a supplementary activity, but rather as an integral part of programme delivery.
He added that improving communications in the current climate of a disconnection between Europe and its citizens is both a political and legal necessity.
Since Cohesion Policy accounts for nearly one third of EU budget expenditure, it is crucial to highlight its achievements and the value it generates for ordinary Europeans.
e workshop set out to collect ideas and experiences on the most effective and interesting ways of presenting projects in order to generate media attention and public interest.
It began with a presentation by Anna Bugalska (Ministry for Regional Development, Poland) of the campain "Poland Growing Beautiful! e ‘Seven miracles of EU funds’ competition", which provided the basis for discussion and raised various questions.
Mr Hall highlighted the new requirement to publish a list of project beneficiaries showing the amount of EU and other public funding allocated. is ties in with the ongoing drive to improve transparency in the Union and, critically, to raise the profile of EU-funded projects.
A new tool was also unveiled: a clickable map leading to national or regional websites providing lists of beneficiaries.
Currently most EU countries are marked in grey, which means they have yet to disclose beneficiaries.
Mr Hall stressed that our aim should be to have all countries coloured green on the map by the end of 20084.
In the afternoon INFORM members had the opportunity to scrutinise and discuss selected aspects of communication during three parallel workshops.
Raphael Goulet (Head of Unit, DG Regional Policy) thanked everyone present for their active involvement.
He stressed that the format of the meeting had stemmed from the fact that it was the first such event and the organisers’ belief that it should briefly introduce all Member States and the networking programmes.
Following the comments received during the day, future meetings will evolve towards a 1.5/2day format, providing more time for networking and in-depth discussions among INFORM members.
Greater prominence will be given to Territorial Cooperation programmes.
Production of a communication guide by DG REGIO and INFORM members e next meeting is scheduled for late November.
As part of the Open Days6(6-9 October 2008), there will also be two related seminars dedicated to information and communication, providing another opportunity to meet up for anyone interested in the topic.
e workshop aimed to kick-start preparations for a new version of the communication guide or handbook. e tool, to be ready by the end of 2008, will provide practical advice on interpreting regulatory requirements plus a selection of information products illustrating various elements relating to communication.
Although communication officers within programmes are its main target group, project promoters might also find parts of it useful.
Each chapter in the guide will combine a theoretical introduction with a practical selection of existing practices compiled from INFORM members.
Each chapter will also have a leading author, who may then select co-authors.

http://www.interact-eu.net/ e INTERACT Programme has recently launched a new website with updated and reorganised content. e site contains a full overview of European Territorial Cooperation during the programming period of 2007-13 and is centred on the main themes covered by INTERACT.
Together with the URBACT II Programme and the European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON), the INTERACT Programme is one of the three network programmes part of the interregional cooperation component of the European Territorial Cooperation Objective.
Its main aim is to promote and support the proper management of the European Territorial Cooperation programmes of 2007-13.
Developing countries can achieve sustainable and equitable growth if they are able to profit fully by the world economy and they have committed leadership. ese are some of the findings of the ‘Growth Report’ published by the Commission on Growth and Development set up under the aegis of the World Bank. e document analyses 13 post-war high-growth economies and outlines factors that may explain their success. e Commission on Growth and Development, chaired by Nobel Laureate Michael Spence, was founded in 2006 and brings together 21 practitioners from government, business and policymaking sectors, mostly from the developing world.
The Inforegio website contains a new section on international affairs, in view of the ever-growing interest in EU Regional Policy outside the European Union.
In 2006 and 2007 the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Regional Policy signed Memoranda of Understanding with Brazil, China and the Russian Federation to set up Structured Dialogues on Regional Policy.
The Structured Dialogues seek to promote mutual understanding, bilateral co-operation, information exchange and best practices regarding the setting up and implementation of Regional Policy.
Features of EU Regional Policy that are of interest to third countries and international organisations such as MERCOSUR include the targeting of financial resources between Member States and regions, geographical and strategic objectives as well as the different dimensions of the implementation system.
‘Working for the Regions – EU Regional Policy 2007-13’ e brochure ‘Working for the Regions – EU Regional Policy 2007-13’ is available in all Community languages. is 36-page publication explains how EU regional policy works and how it supports, for example, transport, innovation, environmental development and urban development in Europe's regions and cities.
Cooperation between regions, the evaluation of programmes, as well as audit, control and publicity requirements are other aspects covered in the publication.

When a Germancompany tried to charge a Belgian SME 16% VAT forrepairing diamond cutting tools the local Antwerp EIC was asked for clarification.
A local tax expert at the VAT administration in Antwerp, consultedby the EIC, stated that the German company should not charge any VAT.The German company and their local VAT administration did not agree.
The EIC then approached the Commission for a letter confirming that inthe case of a temporary export for repair VAT was not payable.
The letterwas sent to the German company.
This resulted in correct invoicing and the German SME keeping a customer and learning about the new tax regime.For the Belgian company it meant it would continue doing business withthe German SME without losing money by paying unrecoverable VAT.

Types of questions an EIC can answer for SMEs
Bristol-based technology company, Owtanet, won a£136,400 contract from the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency thanks tothe Tender Alert Service offered by the local EIC.
> What is the latest legislation on maximum noise levels for manufacturing? > Do I need to put CE marking on my products? > Is financial aid available to buy new machinery or to produce a feasibility study for a joint venture? > What safety standards exist for my machinery? The Bristol EIC, like many other EICs, offers a public sector tender alert service that identifies tender noticeswhich have specific relevance to individual companies.The alert is sent to the company on the day the tenderis published, ensuring that they have the maximum leadtime in which to respond.
> When can I put the ‘ECO label’ on my products? > How much import duty is there on wine imported into the EU from the Ukraine? The highly sophisticated search process depends partlyon the software, but more importantly, on the expertise of EIC staff in assessing the correct search profiles andclosely monitoring the results.
“We have been using the Tender Alert Service for nearly a year and it has proved to be very valuable to our business, providing an additional route to the market.”

Some EICs alsoprovide assistance and training to SMEs on specifictopics such as marketing on the web and increasingweb visibility.
In order to spread this expertise effectively throughout the network, specific EIC working groups havebeen developed.
Their mission is to further raise thequality of services EICs provide to their clients.
Novatex, a Spanishtextile products manufacturer of“single use” goods used in the medical, catering andpersonal hygiene sector wanted to expand its business. It approached a major distributor with a view toentering a co-operation agreement with it.
EICs have entered close co-operation with trade andprofessional organisations representing SMEs, someof which participate in the network as associate members.
Whether they are European or national representatives of SMEs in their various sectors, they puttheir expertise in their specialist fields at the disposalof the network through training and informationexchange.
Their standing and authority lend addedvalue to the network as a whole.
The textile company had little knowledge about CEmarking and thought it was a type of optional qualitylabelling.
The EIC in Asturias was contacted and immediately explained the function of CE Marking and theaccompanying legislative requirements.
The EIC theninvestigated which of the company’s products wouldhave to carry the label.
There was uncertainty regarding what constituted a medical device, so the EIC clarified the matter by contacting the national Health Ministry who resolved the issue.
Many information products are availablefrom the EICs directly or via the Europainternet site.
One example: ‘Selling to the Public Sector in Europe – a practical guide forsmall and medium-sized companies’ wasdownloaded 8200 times in 2002.

EICs are encouraged to undertake actions to improvethe quality of the service delivered to companies.The following are examples of activities, actions andtools that have been developed by EICs to ensure efficient service delivery and client care: grow and survive.
The European Commission,through Enterprise Directorate-General (DG), ensures EICs maintain the quality of their products and services by a variety of checks and measures.
Service/Customer Charter
Regular client satisfaction studies
Client needs studies
Every EIC is independently audited on a six monthlybasis.
The audit’s objective is to maintain and developthe quality of the service.
EIC operating procedures
Client management systems.
The EIC network prides itself on being a quality network.
The audit reports provide the Commission with evaluation results and statistical data on the network’sactivities and performance.
The reports also containinformation and recommendations concerning specific issues and EICs.
This information is also used torenew or withdraw an EIC’s yearly contract and promote a quality culture within the network.
A Belgiancompany won a five year contract to supply ice-cream to Portugal as a result of two EICs working together.
After identifying a partner and possible business opportunities, the Portuguese EIC provided basic information about the region, the market, investment legislation and helped facilitate and maintain contactbetween the two firms.
Management Training. The needs of the networkand its customers drives all forms of training, both thematic and general, provided the Commission.
The network effect is one of the key strengths of the EIC network.
EICs are in daily contact with each otheron a wide range of issues and are sharing best practice among themselves.
Best practice is also communicated to the network through common centrallysupported electronic methods, some of which havebeen specifically developed to help exchangesbetween EICs.
Furthermore, the Commission regularlyprovides a wide range of networking opportunities.
An Italiancompany wanting to export itswines and oils to Austriaasked the EIC hostedby Promofirenze, a special agency of the Chamber of Commerce in Florence, to organise an event to introduce the firm to the Austrian market.
This was one of many suchrequests so the EIC organised a workshop in Vienna.
“It’s important to know that the Euro Info Centre
More than 30 Austrian companies and 13Italianfirms participated in the event, including thewine and oil company.
Its services have helped us to save loads of energy, time and money.”

European Commission. Host organisations areselected according to the quality of their contactswith companies in their regions.
They are linked tothe Commission by a contractual agreement andwith whom they share a privileged partnership.
The will to work towards shared objectives with therepresentative organisations of enterprises is crucialto the provision of services provided by the network.Organisations which accommodate Community networks - the host structures - are pioneers in thistype of relationship and way of working with the European Union.
All EICs are housed within host organisations whichprovide significant financial and logistical support, aswell as access to their databases and informationsources.
Enterprise DG co-finances the network, provides training, and defines its strategy and mode ofoperation.
This partnership means SMEs benefit froma full and complementary range of services.

EICs at the CENTRE of community business support NETWORKS n order to assist SMEs to understand where toobtain the assistance they really need the European
Commission is investigating the closer alignment ofthe various business support networks operating in Europe.
This means closer collaboration between EICsand other networks such as the Business & Innovation Centres (BICs), Innovation Relay Centres(IRCs) should take place. EICs involved in the Local Co-operation project,together with other local and regional business support organisations, have developed a number of toolsto assist them in providing the highest value addedservices to clients.
For example, signposting andbusiness service guides have been developed to helpcompanies navigate the array of business supportagencies.
SMEs at a local level have already benefited fromthe Commission’s well established Local Co-operationinitiative.
Aimed at enhancing co-operation between EICs, other networks, business intermediaries andothers (such as government bodies), the initiativehas resulted in more efficient business support provisions, stemming from increased co-ordination andvisibility of services.
VALUE
EICs in Augsburg, Munich and Nuremberg, Germany, created a Bavarian web site together with several partners, including an Innovation Relay Centre.
The website provides SMEs with access to and information on the best and most appropriate business support network or organisation in their area.
In Bulgaria, five EICs worked on local co-operation projects.
These culminated in the production of a variety of business aids, such as a Guide of Services to SMEsbrochure. Published both in English and Bulgarian, the brochure describes all the services provided by the various business support organisations.
Common websites have been constructed by EICs, and their partners, in regions of Sweden, Poland, the Czech
These are all aimed at giving SMEs efficient and easy access to the business support network which is the most relevant to their query.

A number of recent initiatives reflect that quality control in education is an important issue on the political agenda of the European Commission as well as in many European countries.
Within the Lisbon process, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of education and training systems in Europe is one of the three main goals to be achieved in the period up to 2010.
In this context, the European Commission has set up an expert group on ‘Improving the Education of Teachers and Trainers’.
In the spring of 2004, a sub-group of this expert group, in cooperation with the Standing Group on Indicators and Benchmarks (also established by the European Commission under the same framework), addressed the question of ‘developing suitable indicators for measuring improvement in the education of teachers and, in particular, their continuing professional development’.
The group has identified the development of systems for the evaluation and accreditation of the initial and inservice education of teachers as one of the priorities involved in improving teacher education.
Concern for quality assurance in teacher education is closely linked to the broader context of the development of higher education and the followup of the Bologna Process.
The European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA, http://www.enqa.net) established standards and guidelines for quality assurance in higher education in Europe which were adopted at the Conference of Ministers responsible for Higher Education, in Bergen in May 2005.
ENQA points out that ‘Institutions should have a policy and associated procedures for the assurance of the quality and standards of their programmes and awards.
They should also commit themselves explicitly to the development of a culture which recognises the importance of quality, and quality assurance, in their work’.
In light of the Lisbon and Bologna processes, the European Commission asked Eurydice in the autumn of 2004 to carry out a study on regulations for the evaluation of teacher education in European countries.
This survey analyses processes for evaluating and accrediting initial and inservice teacher education programmes and institutions.
It provides a general overview of the existence of regulations on external and internal evaluation in different countries as well as specific information on the main features of these processes and the use made of their findings.
A review of the main debates and reforms concerning this issue is also included.

The Eurydice European Unit is very grateful to all National Units in the Network for providing relevant information within a very short time.
We hope that this comparative analysis will allow greater insight into the organisation of quality assurance measures for teacher education and pave the way to further investigations.

This study is concerned with processes for evaluating and accrediting institutions and programmes for initial and inservice teacher education.
The evaluations concerned result in reports or recommendations drawn up for each institution or programme evaluated.
Evaluations of the education system as a whole that lead solely to general reports on the state of that system are not a central aspect of the study.
Only types of evaluation focusing on the quality of provision of teacher education are taken into account.
These may be related to aspects such as the content and organisation of teacher education, the qualification profiles of teacher educators, how students are assessed or their achievements.
Financial audits and safety, security or environmental controls are not taken into account.
The education of teachers in primary and general secondary education (ISCED levels 1-3, see glossary) who will be employed in the public and grant-aided private sectors of education has been covered.
The education and training of teachers for vocational education is not included.
The reference year for data is 2005/06.
Recent and forthcoming reforms are also considered.
In all cases, the information shown in the Figures relates to official regulations or recommendations.
Where countries have no regulations governing a particular aspect of the evaluation of institutions or programmes for teacher education or indeed the process as a whole, information on current practices has, whenever available, been included in the text or in a note.
Methodology and definitions
The questionnaire prepared by the Eurydice European Unit for gathering the necessary information is available on the Eurydice website (see www.eurydice.org).
The questionnaire was devised for gathering similar and readily comparable information from all countries but also included spaces for describing special national characteristics.
The present comparative study carried out with reference to the replies obtained from these questionnaires, has been commented on and checked by the 30 Eurydice Network member countries (1).
Some information of specifically national relevance has been included for illustrative purposes.
Information gathering was concerned with official regulations or recommendations relating to the evaluation and/or accreditation of institutions/programmes for initial and inservice teacher education, as well as to ongoing (non-regulated) practices and debates and reforms in this same area.
For the purposes of this study, evaluation and accreditation have been defined as follows:
Evaluation is a general process of systematic and critical analysis leading to judgments and/or recommendations for improvement regarding the quality of a (teacher) education institution or programme.
Accreditation is a process by which an institution or a programme is judged by the relevant legislative and professional authorities as having met predetermined standards in order to provide (teacher) education or training and to award the corresponding qualifications (where they exist).
The accreditation procedure presupposes that the programmes or institutions to be accredited are evaluated.
Structure and content
The first four chapters are concerned with the evaluation and/or the accreditation of institutions and programmes for initial teacher education.
More specifically, Chapter 1 provides a general overview of the existence of regulations on external and internal evaluation in the countries covered.
It also indicates whether these regulations are specific to teacher education or generally applicable to all higher education institutions.
Chapters 2 and 3 deal respectively with the main features of external and internal evaluation.
They describe the various players involved, as well as their qualifications, the documents which have to be used in identifying criteria, the focus and procedures of evaluation and its frequency.
Chapter 4 discusses use of the findings from external and internal evaluation.
It highlights the possible consequences of evaluation for institutions or programmes, as well as the circulation of its findings within them or among the general public and in national reports on the state of initial teacher education or higher education.
Chapter 5 considers the evaluation and accreditation of institutions or programmes for inservice teacher education.
It examines whether regulations govern the evaluation or accreditation of the various types of inservice education providers in each country.
It then describes the bodies responsible for this kind of evaluation and accreditation, the procedures applied, their focus, frequency and the use made of their findings.
A review of the main debates and reforms concerning the evaluation of teacher education is provided in Chapter 6.
Finally, the main issues and results of the study are summarised.
A glossary and an annex describing the various types of internal and external evaluation of initial teacher education by country is included at the end of the study
CHAPTER 1 – THE ORGANISATION OF EVALUATION PROCESSES FOR INITIAL TEACHER EDUCATION
Out of the 30 countries considered in this report, all except Luxembourg have a regulated system for evaluating initial teacher education.
However, the extent to which such evaluation procedures are regulated may differ from one country to the next.
Evaluation may also occur without following any officially binding regulations.
If information is available on current quality assurance practices, it is provided in the appropriate sections of this report.
Normally, initial teacher education for all three educational levels considered here (ISCED 1-3) is evaluated, except in three countries.
The German-speaking Community of Belgium provides initial teacher education solely for primary education while, in Cyprus, only institutions training teachers for primary level (and some teachers of English at secondary level) are evaluated.
In general, teacher education for secondary level is provided at universities, for which there is currently no regulated system of evaluation.
In contrast, in Austria, regulations on evaluation only exist for universities training teachers for secondary level.
Some countries evaluate their entire system of teacher education.
The purpose of a broader approach of this kind is not to focus primarily on individual institutions, but rather to monitor the whole system of initial teacher education.
It may provide either a basis for reform or an evaluation of newly implemented reforms, as shown in the examples below.
As such procedures do not occur in all countries, these evaluations are not considered in detail in the present analysis.
In Denmark in October 2003, the Danish Institute of Evaluation (EVA) published an evaluation of initial teacher education programmes for compulsory education (folkeskole).
The entire system, including all 18 teacher education colleges, was evaluated based on the internal evaluation reports from all institutions.
The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the programme in general, and no individual recommendations were made.
Although EVA conducted the evaluation on the basis of internal evaluation reports, the latter were anonymised in the final report in order to focus on the programme in general and not on the specific teacher training colleges.
In Malta, the implementation of the teacher education programmes revised in 1999 is being evaluated in 2005/06.
In Sweden, initial teacher education at all 25 institutions and the teacher education reform from 2001 in particular were evaluated in 2004, and the results were reported back to the government in spring 2005.
This was part of the reform and is also a regular part of the evaluation system for all higher education.
In the United Kingdom (Wales), a review of the provision of initial teacher education on behalf of the Welsh Assembly Government has been underway since 2005.
The aim of the review is to advise on how it may more effectively meet the current and likely future needs of maintained schools in Wales, in the context of the Welsh Assembly Government’s developing policies and aims.
The overall objective is to see how initial teacher education provision could meet demands more appropriately and encourage under-represented groups to teach in future.
In the United Kingdom (Scotland), the Inspectorate of Education is also authorised to inspect initial teacher education through a process known as Aspect Review.
This looks at how a certain aspect of initial teacher education is being dealt with across the whole of the system, rather than just within a specific institution.
Following an Aspect Review, comments may be made about individual institutions as well as at system level.
Between 2004 and 2006 in Norway, all general teacher education programmes will be evaluated as part of one large project.
A similar – though smaller – project was carried out in 2001 when all types of teacher education were evaluated, with only a small sample of institutions taking part.
In 24 countries or regions, only general regulations for the evaluation of all higher education apply to the evaluation of teacher education (Figure 1.1).
Apart from the legislative framework for the evaluation or accreditation of higher education, no specific evaluation systems are geared to teacher education.
The extent to which these general regulations may take particular components into consideration and examine the quality of specific content in greater detail, largely depends on the documents from which evaluation criteria are derived (see Chapters 2 and 3 for further information).
In six countries, evaluation of teacher education is governed by both general and specific regulations.
In most cases, specific regulations apply to a particular stage of initial teacher education.
This may be the professional training phase or a particular part of it in the consecutive model, or the induction phase.
In Germany, specific regulations apply solely to the evaluation of the final ‘on-the-job’ qualifying (induction) phase, which is organised by the teacher training institutes (Studienseminare).
The situation is similar in France where, besides general regulations, specific regulations apply to the evaluation of training provided by the university institutes for teacher education (Institut universitaire de formation des maîtres, IUFMs).
In Ireland, the provision of final teaching practice is evaluated separately.
In Poland, teacher education provided by universities is evaluated in accordance with general regulations for quality control in higher education, whereas specific regulations apply in the case of teacher training colleges.
In the United Kingdom, there are arrangements for the review of all higher education institutions by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA).
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, there are separate arrangements, established by law, for the school inspectorates to evaluate programmes of initial teacher education.
The situation is similar in Scotland.
These specific arrangements cover programmes leading to teacher qualifications.
Both undergraduate (concurrent model) and postgraduate (consecutive model) programmes are covered by these specific arrangements, but general education programmes leading to a bachelor’s degree (as required for entry to a postgraduate programme) are not.
These arrangements also cover employment-based routes and, in England only, programmes offered by school-centred training consortia.

General regulations apply to the evaluation of all higher education (including initial teacher education).
Specific regulations apply to the evaluation of initial teacher education programmes or institutions.
An evaluation process may consist of external evaluation, in which bodies or persons outside the institution or programme concerned evaluate the provision (Chapter 2), and internal or selfevaluation, which is normally carried out by the provider itself (Chapter 3).
As will be explained in these chapters, external and internal evaluations are often very closely interrelated; one type of evaluation might rely on the results of the other, or each might draw on the other’s findings.
In some countries, evaluation may be regarded as a single process consisting of one stage completed by persons inside an institution, and another stage carried out externally.
In several countries, regulations provide for more than one evaluation procedure, including external and/or internal evaluation. There are various reasons for this: different components or stages of education
Quality Assurancein Teacher Educationin Europe are evaluated separately (as in Germany and Ireland); several bodies conduct evaluation independently (France); organisational aspects of the institution and its programme content are evaluated separately (the Czech Republic, Latvia, Slovakia and Iceland); initial teacher education and higher education institutions are generally evaluated separately (United Kingdom); or evaluation procedures depend on the kinds of institution offering initial teacher education (Poland) or on the educational level at which it is provided (Romania) (1).
Chapters 2 and 3, which deal with external and internal evaluation respectively, take such differences into account where necessary (for more country-specific details please refer to the Annex).
External evaluation is compulsory in most countries and is recommended in Germany, Spain and France.
In Germany, the presidents of universities or colleges of education may recommend an external evaluation if their assessment of internal evaluation results convinces them of the necessity to do so.
The ANECA (National Agency for Quality Evaluation and Accreditation) in Spain does not require higher education institutions to undertake evaluation, but allows them to apply voluntarily for external evaluation following official calls for expressions of interest.
A 2004 Royal Decree establishes that universities must accredit the proper development of all teaching, corresponding to syllabuses being recognised and implemented from the actual date on which this decree came into force.
In any case, before October 2010, universities will have to undergo an accreditation process.
External evaluation is optional in Austrian universities, which provide teacher education for academic secondary schools.
The situation is similar in Denmark.
In Italy and Malta, there is no reference to external evaluation in official regulations.
However a committee at the Italian ministry analyses quantitative data on the infrastructure and staffing of each programme, and financial support is withheld if the figures fall below prescribed levels.
The situation is quite similar in the case of internal evaluation, which is compulsory in the majority of countries and recommended in Spain, France, Cyprus and Slovenia.
In Spain, internal evaluation is regulated by each institution’s selfevaluation plans, as well as by the aims, activities and programmes currently developed and promoted by the ANECA.
In France, internal evaluation is recommended prior to external evaluations for contractual purposes.
Universities in Slovenia strongly advise their member faculties to carry out internal evaluation.
The Rules on Financing Higher Education Institutions (2003) stipulate that higher education institutions that have not produced an evaluation report are not entitled to full payment for their services.
1) In Romania, initial teacher education for primary school teachers may also be provided at upper secondary level.
However, the present report is limited to the evaluation of teacher education at tertiary level.

Initial teacher training for general secondary education is provided outside the Community.
Most teachers are trained in the French Community of Belgium.
Denmark: For internal evaluation, the information shown relates to universities only.
Greece: The information relates to the law on quality assurance in higher education issued in August 2005.
Cyprus: The information relates solely to the external evaluation of colleges providing initial teacher education for primary education.
There is no external evaluation system for the university.
However, in 2001, the university requested the European University Association to organise an institutional quality review, which was repeated in 2004.
Austria: The figure only refers to initial teacher education provided by universities.
The future law on the new Pädagogische Hochschulen also foresees external and internal evaluation for teacher education institutions.
However, several of them have carried out internal evaluations in recent years and have also been evaluated externally.
United Kingdom: There is no explicit directive to undertake internal evaluation for higher education institutions.
They are autonomous, and each has its own internal procedures for attaining appropriate standards and assuring the quality of its provision.
All providers of initial teacher education must systematically monitor and evaluate all aspects of provision in order to improve quality.
CHAPTER 2 EXTERNAL EVALUATION OF INITIAL TEACHER EDUCATION
Evaluation undertaken by bodies or persons not directly involved in the activities of the particular programme or institution concerned is generally referred to as external evaluation.
It is a process whereby data, information, and evidence relating to individual institutions or programmes are collected in order to make a statement about their quality.
Normally carried out by a team of experts, peers or inspectors, this external review aims to reach an independent judgement concerning the quality of education provided within a particular setting.
This chapter will therefore consider the following: the one or more bodies responsible for external evaluation and the qualifications required of external evaluators; the official documents which have to be used to draw up external evaluation criteria; the precise scope of external evaluation; the procedures and mechanisms on which it relies; the frequency of external evaluation.
Responsible bodies and qualifications required of evaluators
Regulations concerning the bodies responsible for external evaluation exist in all countries where there are formal requirements for external evaluation.
In the majority of them, such evaluation is carried out by an evaluation agency, committee or independent body acting on behalf of the public authorities.
In Belgium (Flemish Community), the Netherlands, Slovenia and Slovakia, a committee and an independent body together coordinate the external evaluation procedure, whereas in Germany, this collaboration is optional.
In Cyprus, Poland (in the case of teacher training colleges) and Iceland, the Ministry of Education is directly responsible for external evaluation.
In France, the ministry shares the responsibility with independent bodies, and in the case of Belgium (German-speaking Community), with the inspectorate for school education.
In the United Kingdom (England, Wales and Northern Ireland), initial teacher education is evaluated externally by the schools inspectorate.
This is also the case in Ireland in respect of teaching practice.
An education agency performs this task in Sweden and the United Kingdom (Scotland).

Chapter 2 – External Evaluation of Initial Teacher Education
Figure 2.2: Profile of external evaluators of initial teacher education for general education (ISCED 1-3), 2005/06
Finland: FINHEEC also often uses peer evaluation.
The regulations make explicit reference to the participation of foreign experts contributing to external evaluation in Belgium (French Community), Greece, Latvia, Hungary, Austria, Portugal, Slovakia and Iceland.
In Latvia, their involvement is compulsory except when first-level professional higher education programmes (ISCED 5B) or colleges are evaluated.
This is also the case in Iceland where no member of the peer review group should have any kind of association with the institution evaluated.
In the other countries, foreign participation is recommended.
Only in Belgium (Flemish Community), the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and Norway is it compulsory or recommended to include students in the team of external evaluators.
In Germany, their involvement is optional.
Several countries specify more precisely the composition of their evaluation committee.
In the Czech Republic, the accreditation commission consists of 21 members appointed by the government upon nomination by the minister for a six-year term.
Membership in the accreditation commission is incompatible with the duties of the rector, vice-rectors and deans.
In Spain, the external evaluation committee has to be well balanced in terms of the training and experience of its members.
There are generally three members as follows: the chairperson, a university professor whose function is to preside and direct the external evaluation process and oversee the preparation of a report containing the opinions of the committee; an academic member selected from among either those with possible experience in the technical units of universities, or experts in the subject(s) taught who have previous experience of evaluation; and finally a member whose professional activity is also related to the taught subject(s).
In Portugal, people with recognised expertise in the educational, artistic, scientific and entrepreneurial fields are eligible for appointment as external evaluators.
In Finland, the Ministry of Education appoints a committee consisting of 12 members with a good understanding of evaluation, who represent universities, polytechnics, students and employers.
Official documents establishing criteria
A variety of official documents may be recommended or required as the basis for external evaluation criteria.
They may include general legislation on higher education, regulations or guidelines on initial teacher education, qualification standards for prospective teachers, a list of evaluation criteria or specific national indicators on educator/student ratios, student performance, etc.
In Belgium (French Community), Lithuania, Poland and Romania, all documents listed here are taken into account for drawing up evaluation criteria.
The situation is similar in the Netherlands and Sweden.
In Denmark, Austria and Finland, there are no regulations regarding the documents to be taken into account.
Legislation on higher education and a list of evaluation criteria are the official sources most often used in the context of external evaluation.
The majority of countries also refer to one or several documents which deal specifically with teacher education.
Thirteen countries or regions use a document on qualification standards for prospective teachers for the purpose of external evaluation.
Several countries make use of other specific documents relating to teacher education.
These may be regulations or guidelines.
The ‘Guidelines for Initial Teacher Education Courses’ in Scotland give regulations on the requirements for initial teacher education and specify such things as the length of programmes, the amount of school experience and compulsory programme elements.
The ‘Standard for Initial Teacher Education: Benchmark Information’ contains a set of benchmarks against which programmes can be considered and a set of expected features which students should have attained at the end of their programmes.
The Evaluation Framework for the Accreditation of Programmes of Initial Teacher Education and the Arrangements for the Accreditation of Programmes of Initial Teacher Education give detailed guidance on how the accreditation process works.
The Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Hungary, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Iceland and Norway do not stipulate the use of documents devoted specifically to initial teacher education for external evaluation.
However, these countries have all adopted lists of criteria, some of which may involve aspects directly relating to teacher education.
Some countries report the existence of ‘guides’ or ‘questionnaires’ for external evaluation.
In Latvia, for example, the Higher Education Quality Evaluation Centre has developed a questionnaire for evaluation experts, which consists of questions regarding the main quality aspects to be evaluated.
Although it may not be defined as a statutory list, it is normally used by experts to facilitate the evaluation process and to prepare reports on the institutions evaluated.
Eleven countries use national indicators on trainer/student ratios, student performance, and the relation between the labour market and the availability of study places (Slovenia), in order to draw up external evaluation criteria.

Additional notes (Figure 2.3)
Belgium (BE de): The information relates solely to the evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education.
France: There are no qualification standards but the results of the annual competitive examinations for the recruitment ofteachers are used to evaluate the initial teacher education programme. Cyprus: The figure relates solely to the evaluation of colleges providing initial teacher education for primary education.
United Kingdom: The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general.
Explanatory note For the definition of evaluation criteria and qualification standards, please refer to the glossary.
The scope of external evaluation may encompass a wide variety of issues.
It may be concerned with the results of internal evaluation, the content of the curriculum for teacher education, teaching methods (i.e. how the content of that curriculum is taught), or assessment practices.
It may also consider the balance between professional training and general education, the management of school placements for teaching practice, potential partnerships with schools and the general human resources management of institutions (e.g. the qualifications required by teacher trainers or their continuing professional development).
Other important aspects which may be evaluated are the trainer/student ratio, student performance, the attitudes and motivation of students, their opinions on the education they receive, and the general infrastructure of institutions (including libraries, ICT facilities and laboratories, etc.).
Many countries focus their external evaluation on all or almost all of these issues.
Only Ireland refers to relatively few of them.
The regulations of almost all countries state that external evaluation has to take account of internal evaluation procedures or recommend that it should do so.
In Denmark, Austria, Finland and Sweden, there are no regulations concerning the scope of external evaluation.
This does not imply that the issues mentioned in Figure 2.4 are not usually covered.
In these countries, the external evaluator or the institutions requesting an evaluation decide about its scope.
In Finland, the body carrying out external evaluation (FINHEEC) establishes the targets of evaluation on the basis of the following criteria: the programme or theme is significant in regard to education and social policies and a rapidly growing, developing or problematic field in the area of higher education.
FINHEEC can also make an agreement with the ministry of education on evaluation assignments.
Moreover, institutions and student unions can propose suitable evaluation topics to FINHEEC.
Virtually all countries with regulations evaluate the content of teacher education.
Either methods of teaching or assessment are also considered in all countries, except in France, Latvia (in the case of evaluation of the institution) and Iceland (in the case of evaluation of the institution).
In all countries except in the Czech Republic (in the case of evaluation of programmes), Ireland, Cyprus and Slovenia, external evaluation takes account of student performance and, in over half of them, student attitudes and opinions are considered.
Additional criteria are mentioned by a few countries.
Spain reports the existence of ‘course organisation criteria’ concerned with the work of the team responsible for the educational programme, its management, planning, communication and organisation.
External evaluation in the United Kingdom (England) examines whether training meets the needs of individual trainees and how applicants for training are selected.

External evaluation may be conducted in different ways.
It is normally based on a site visit and on an internal evaluation report.
Such a visit may include interviews or surveys with the management, academic and administrative staff as well as with students.
Observations directly linked to student teachers being taught may also be included.
Many countries adopt all or almost all of these procedures in external evaluation, although there are no regulations on this issue in Denmark, Austria and Finland.
In Finland, the higher education institutions under review compile selfevaluation reports for the external evaluation team.
This team visits the higher education institutions involved and writes a review report.
Besides this basic method, FINHEEC also uses other evaluation methods such as portfolios, peer evaluation and benchmarking.
Site visits are compulsory or recommended for external evaluation everywhere, except in Slovenia and Slovakia, where they are optional.
In Slovenia, external evaluation is based on the documentation submitted by higher education institutions applying for evaluation.
In the majority of countries, site visits include interviews with the management and with academic and administrative staff.
Regulations also provide frequently for interviews with students.
In many countries, regulations of the evaluation process provide for interviews with all three categories of participants.
In Latvia and the Netherlands, interviews with students are compulsory, whereas interviews with the management and staff are optional.
In Spain, interviews with different groups seek to obtain enough data to enable the external evaluation committee to contrast its findings with information on the selfevaluation process.
As a general rule, a particular person may not attend more than one meeting.
The committee will ensure that its interviews with different groups focus on those aspects previously analysed which have yielded contradictory findings, or which seem especially important, are unclear or are not sufficiently conclusive.
Classroom observation (in the institution providing initial teacher education) cannot be regarded as among the main procedures in external evaluation.
Yet while there is no reference to it in the regulations of most countries, it is nevertheless compulsory in nine of them.
In the United Kingdom (England), interviews with staff in partnership schools are included in the procedures.
The results of internal evaluation are taken into consideration in almost all places where regulations exist.
In the French Community of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary (in the case of internal evaluation carried out every eight years), the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Iceland, internal and external evaluation amount to a single process which is organised as follows: an internal evaluation is carried out with the aim of providing specific information, and a report is forwarded to the external evaluators who conduct a site visit and write an evaluation report.
Elsewhere, external evaluators make use of internal evaluation reports that are not produced specifically for purposes of external evaluation.

Additional notes (Figure 2.5)
Belgium (BE de): The information relates solely to the evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education.
Poland: (1) relates to external evaluation of universities, and (2) to external evaluation of teacher training colleges.
Procedures not mentioned in official documents are, however, usually included in the evaluation process.
United Kingdom: The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general.
Explanatory note For the definition of site visit, please refer to the glossary.
The frequency of external evaluation of institutions and programmes providing initial teacher education varies greatly between countries and sometimes even within a country when several types of external evaluation exist or when there are no regulations on the subject established at central or higher level.
In most European countries, external evaluation of institutions and programmes providing initial teacher education takes place at fixed intervals which are determined at central or higher level.
In some countries, there are several types of external evaluation with different fixed intervals.
As regards the fixed intervals determined for external evaluation, at one extreme, evaluation occurs annually, and at the other, the interval is set for every 12 years.
In ten countries or regions, the intervals specified correspond to maximum periods, which means that external evaluation may occur more often.
The highest frequency relating specifically to the evaluation of initial teacher education is noted in Ireland (evaluation of teaching practice) and the United Kingdom (England).
Each year in Ireland, 10 % of students in their final year of teacher education for primary schools are selected for assessment during their teaching practice.
The institutions in which they enrolled receive an evaluation report.
In most countries where external evaluation occurs at fixed regular intervals, it conforms to a pattern conditioned by a procedure for accrediting and re-accrediting teacher education programmes or institutions (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1). These are evaluated at the outset for the purpose of official accreditation.
Regular evaluations for the renewal of accreditation are then generally planned within a period ranging from three to twelve years after the preceding evaluation.
In Latvia, the external evaluation enabling new institutions to be accredited for the first time is normally not repeated.
In Slovenia, prior to the new law on higher education issued in 2004, a similar situation was in force concerning teacher education programmes.
On the contrary, in Latvia, the reaccreditation of teaching programmes is mandatory.
In Sweden, regular evaluation linked to the (re-)accreditation of higher education institutions is carried out, but no procedure is planned for new programmes or institutions.

Additional notes Belgium (BE de): The information relates solely to evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education.
For general secondary education, teacher education is provided outside the Community.
For the latter, the distinct intervals shown depend on the length of teacher training.
Accreditation is awarded for at most twice the standard length of study programmes.
Denmark: The Center for Videregående Uddannelse are given the possibility to participate in a single accreditation process allowing them to obtain the quality label of University Colleges.
Germany: Only evaluations of bachelor’s- and master’s-type programmes are used for the purpose of accreditation (or re-accreditation).
France: (1) relates to evaluation carried out by the DES; and (2) to evaluation carried out by the CNE and the IGAENR.
Once an institution has been accredited, a second evaluation occurs after four years.
Then, evaluation occurs after a further ten years.
A draft law has been tabled with a view to performing external evaluations every four years.
Latvia: (1) relates to external evaluation of programmes; and (2) to external evaluation of institutions.
Austria: The figure only refers to initial teacher education provided by universities.
Slovenia: The new (2004) law on higher education has established the principle of compulsory reaccreditation every seven years, with effect from 2005.
This will be applied to institutions for teacher education once they have designed their study programmes according to the Bologna requirements.
Slovakia: (1) relates to external evaluation of programmes; and (2) to external evaluation of institutions.
Sweden: An interval of six years between external evaluations is normally the rule for higher education institutions.
However, an extra evaluation of teacher education programmes will occur in 2006, two years after the previous evaluation.
This is an exceptional situation linked to the monitoring of the 2001 reform of programmes for initial teacher education (see chapter 1).
United Kingdom (ENG/WLS/NIR): The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general.
In England, programmes for teacher education are to be evaluated at least twice in the six-year period from 2005 to 2011.
In Wales, the aim is to complete the current cycle of inspections by 2008, after which a different cycle will be introduced. United Kingdom (SCT): (1) relates to evaluation of all higher education institutions; and (2) to evaluation of institutions for initial teacher education.
In ten countries or regions, the interval between external evaluations varies according to the programme or institution.
In France, institutions for teacher education have to undergo one type of external evaluation that occurs at regular intervals and another whose frequency varies.
In the Czech Republic, the interval between evaluations of study programmes is fixed by regulations, which is not the case for institutions.
Several scenarios are possible in cases where the frequency of external evaluation varies according to the programme or institution.
In the French Community of Belgium, the Czech Republic (in the case of the external institution evaluation), France (in the case of evaluation by the CNE and IGAENR), the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and Iceland, the frequency is fixed by the body responsible for evaluation, in so far as the latter decides annually or periodically which institutions or programmes should be evaluated, with due regard for various considerations.
In the Czech Republic, where evaluation is concerned with similar types of programme, the education faculties were last evaluated in 1997/98.
In Iceland, external evaluations relating to programmes or institutions for teacher education occurred in 1998 and 2005.
In Germany, Spain, Austria and Finland, higher education institutions are also involved in the decision to proceed with external evaluation.
In Denmark, it can take place upon the request of various bodies.
In Denmark, programme evaluation may be conducted by EVA (Danish Evaluation Institute) on its own initiative and upon the request of, for example, the government, ministries, advisory boards, local authorities and establishments.
In Germany, external evaluation is carried out on the initiative of universities and teacher training centres, or the ministry of education in the case of teacher training institutes (Studienseminare) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1).
For bachelor’s- or master’s-type programmes, there is a procedure for accreditation and reaccreditation.
The legislation of the different Länder states that all external evaluation should be carried out regularly without specifying its frequency.
In Spain, the ANECA issues a call for applications, annually or every two years, from higher education institutions wishing to be evaluated.
The decision whether to submit to evaluation is taken by the head of the institution.
However, all institutions will have to be evaluated at least once by 2010.
In Austria, external evaluation may be conducted at the request of the universities or the Ministry for Education, Science and Culture.
In Finland, universities are obliged to participate in external evaluations, but since evaluations in different fields may coincide or be close to each other in time, the law is interpreted so that universities can choose the evaluations they want to participate in.
CHAPTER 3 INTERNAL EVALUATION OF INITIAL TEACHER EDUCATION
Internal evaluation (self-evaluation) of teacher education may BE defined as an evaluation process for which those working in a particular institution or programme are responsible.
The process may consist of the systematic collection of data and the questioning of students, lecturers and other staff, and generally results in a final report.
Internal evaluation offers opportunities for quality enhancement in so far as it is a collective appraisal of structures and practices existing within the institution concerned.
As already indicated in Chapter 1, regulations on internal evaluation exist in all countries and regions, except in Luxembourg.
In almost all countries, internal evaluation is compulsory.
It is recommended in Spain, France, Cyprus and Slovenia and is optional in Malta.
An overview of the different kinds of internal evaluation in each country covered by this survey is provided in the annex.
More than one type of internal evaluation exists in the Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, the United Kingdom (Scotland) and Iceland.
In the following figures, a distinction has been made in the case of countries with more than one type of evaluation only when the procedures involved clearly differ from each other.
The present chapter considers the following: those responsible for coordinating internal evaluation; those who take part in it; the official documents which have to be used to establish internal evaluation criteria; the precise scope of internal evaluation; the procedures and mechanisms on which it relies; the frequency of internal evaluation.
Responsibility for organising and coordinating internal evaluation may lie with different bodies such as the management or governing board of the institution evaluated, a special evaluation committee that has been set up for this purpose within the institution itself, or a council of academic staff representatives.
In most countries, coordination is the responsibility of the management.
Where this is not the case, an evaluation committee usually takes over this responsibility.
In Portugal, the United Kingdom (Scotland) and Bulgaria, all or almost all of the four bodies mentioned above take part in the coordination of internal evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, Germany (in the case of teacher training institutes), Poland, Slovenia and Iceland (for the regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions), the responsibility for coordination lies mainly with the management of the institution.
In teacher training institutes (Studienseminare) in Germany, the main body responsible for coordinating internal evaluation is the management.
However, in some Länder, it may also include administrators from the office of teacher training (Amt für Lehrerbildung) or similar institutions in the Länder, and staff from the teacher training institutes to be evaluated.
In universities in Poland, the teacher education faculty or chair of the university is responsible for internal evaluation.
The faculty council usually elects a committee, which has to carry out evaluation and prepare a written report.
In teacher training colleges, internal evaluation is carried out by the college council, while the management team is typically responsible for the evaluation of teaching.
In Slovenia, university rectors and deans are responsible for internal evaluation, according to the 2004 Higher Education Act.
The internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the internal evaluation process has to be managed by a specific commission appointed by the rector/dean.
In the regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions in Iceland, institutions are free to decide how to organise their quality assurance work.
However, the rector bears the main responsibility.
In some institutions, there is a special quality manager, while in others quality issues are the responsibility of the governing board or a council.
In Denmark, the governing board is the sole body responsible for coordinating internal evaluation.
In the French Community of Belgium, Germany (in universities and colleges of education), Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania and Hungary (in annual internal evaluation), an evaluation committee is the sole body responsible for coordination (see Section 3.2 for further information on the composition of evaluation committees in some of these countries).
A council of academic staff representatives also contributes to the coordination of internal evaluation in Estonia, Italy (on an optional basis), Portugal, Slovakia (optional) and Bulgaria.
In Bulgaria, the evaluation committee presents its reports to the governing board of the institution.
The reports are then officially approved by the council of academic staff representatives which finally issues recommendations to the management.

Management
Cyprus: The Figure relates solely to the internal evaluation of colleges providing initial teacher education for primary education.Luxembourg: For secondary education, the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad.
Hungary: (1) relates to annual internal evaluation, and (2) to internal evaluation that takes place prior to external evaluation.
United Kingdom (ENG/WLS/NIR): The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general.
Iceland: (1) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation, and (2) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions.
Participants in internal evaluation may be the management, academic staff or students of the institution concerned, but special evaluation experts may also take part.
These experts may either act on behalf of the principal or board of the institution, or simply give methodological/technical support to the staff responsible for conducting the evaluation.
In almost all countries where regulations exist, it is either compulsory for the management of the institution, representatives of its academic staff and students to participate in internal evaluation, or they are recommended to do so.
In Ireland, only evaluation experts who work on behalf of the principal or board take part in internal evaluation.
In Italy, neither the management nor the academic staff takes part in evaluation.
In the Netherlands, the participation of the management is optional.
In nine countries, all or almost all of the five main players indicated in Figure 3.2 take part in internal evaluation.
As already described in Section 3.1, responsibility for carrying out internal evaluation may lie with a special evaluation committee established within the institution (see Figure 3.1).
The members of this committee may come from a wide range of backgrounds.
In the French Community of Belgium, members of the evaluation committee are representatives of the teaching and academic staff, administrative and technical staff, and students.
In Estonia, the members of the committee for the evaluation of study programmes are appointed by the faculties or departments concerned.
It is strongly recommended that students should be included in its membership.
In Greece, the faculty’s evaluation group should consist of teaching/research or educational staff holding the rank of professor or assistant professor, as well as a student representative.
In Spain, the committee normally has to be chaired by the person in charge of the study programme evaluated and consists of teachers, administrative and service staff, students, and a member of the technical unit for quality.
It is recommended that committees should have a maximum of seven members.
In Hungary, the committee members are professors and researchers elected by the council of the institution for a period of three years.
The student self-governing body may delegate a representative to the committee, subject to the approval of the council.
In Iceland, the committee should comprise at least four and no more than six members drawn from faculty staff, students and administration.
Chapter 3 –Internal Evaluation of Initial Teacher Education
In some countries, evaluation experts who work on behalf of the principal or board or who offer support to staff during internal evaluation may also take an active part in it.
However, in most cases, their involvement is no more than recommended or optional, except in Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom (Scotland) where it is compulsory.

United Kingdom (ENG/WLS/NIR): The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general.
Evaluations would normally also involve schools in partnership with higher education institutions.
United Kingdom (SCT): (1) relates to annual internal evaluation, and (2) to internal evaluation that takes place every four years.
Iceland: (1) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation, and (2) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions.
Several countries state that other participants may contribute to internal evaluation, including the institution’s non-academic staff, external stakeholders from the business sector or academic life elsewhere, and former graduates of the institution.
In the French Community of Belgium, those who graduated from the institution in the three years prior to internal evaluation may participate.
In the Flemish Community of Belgium, the administrative and technical staff of the institution participate on a compulsory basis.
In Greece, the participation of the scientific and administrative staff is optional.
In Italy, the evaluation committee consists of academic and non-academic experts chosen by the rector.
The majority of its members are usually academics, some of them from other universities.
In Spain and Portugal, administrative and service staff may participate in internal evaluation.
In the United Kingdom (Scotland), it is compulsory for people external to the faculty or school offering the programme and for people from outside the institution to take part in the annual evaluation.
In Romania, it is recommended that representatives of the institution’s best graduates and of employers should take part in the internal evaluation of pedagogical university colleges and universities.
In several countries, although no official regulations exist, there may be practices defining who usually participates in internal evaluation.
In Malta, for example, all academic staff members are encouraged to conduct an evaluation of their course programme by means of questionnaires or interviews with their students.
The respective departmental heads may also carry out their own independent evaluations.
External experts from abroad serving as moderators are invited to review both the course content and assessed assignments. They may also put forward recommendations for possible improvements.
Although it is not officially regulated, management, academic staff and students are usually involved in internal evaluation in Austrian universities.
The situation is similar in Pädagogische Akademien.
In Slovenia, the internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the specific commission appointed by the dean for managing the internal evaluation process should be composed of teachers, administrators and student representatives.
Regulations may refer to a variety of official documents such as general legislation on higher education, regulations on initial teacher education, qualification standards for prospective teachers, a list of evaluation criteria (either a list specially drawn up for internal evaluation or the one adopted for external evaluation) or national indicators that may be used to draw up criteria for internal evaluation.
Virtually all of the foregoing types of document are used to identify the criteria for internal evaluation in the French Community of Belgium, Greece, Lithuania and Poland.
Almost all countries use legislation on higher education to establish the criteria of internal evaluation, always in conjunction with several of the other documents referred to above.
In almost all cases, the use of such documents is compulsory, except in the French Community of Belgium and Romania, where their use is recommended.
Several countries publish special documents, including a list of criteria for internal evaluation, to support higher education institutions in their task.
In the French Community of Belgium, the internal evaluation report is drawn up by the evaluation committee using a guide to methodology which contains, as a framework, the list of indicators specified in the legislation establishing the agency for the evaluation of higher education.
In Spain, the ANECA publishes two main methodological resources to support universities in carrying out their institutional evaluation programme.
The first, the Modelo de Evaluación 2004-2005 (assessment model), contains six criteria identifying the most important aspects to be assessed during selfevaluation, namely the educational programme, course organisation, human resources, material resources, educational process and results.
The second, the Guía de Autoevaluación (self-evaluation guide), is intended to facilitate the start of the selfevaluation phase.
While, in France, the Livre des Références of higher education institutions fully outlines in principle the subject and criteria of internal evaluation, there is up to now no version of it specifically for the evaluation of IUFMs.
However, like all other higher education institutions, IUFMs will be increasingly expected in the first instance to carry out selfevaluation using the Livre des Références.
In Hungary, the Accreditation Committee provides guidelines for higher education institutions to prepare their annual institutional evaluation report and detailed guidance concerning the documents relating to self-evaluation.
Half of all countries also refer to the list of criteria used for external evaluation.
In Slovakia, the list of criteria developed by the Accreditation Committee for purposes of external evaluation and accreditation is very often used for the internal evaluation of study programmes in general.
While the use of the external evaluation criteria for annual evaluation is optional in the United Kingdom (Scotland), internally devised criteria will generally not differ dramatically from them.
Figure 3.3: Official documents to be used to establish criteria for the internal evaluation of initial teacher education for general education (ISCED 1-3), 2005/06
No regulations or no reference included in them
Additional notes (Figure 3.3 – continued)
Iceland: (1) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation, and (2) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions. Norway: The criteria for external evaluation do not address teacher education specifically.
However, the internal evaluation of teacher education must refer to existing national qualification frameworks for programmes that provide it. These include regulations, content guidelines and qualification standards.
In the United Kingdom, although there are no specific regulations to this effect, the use of external evaluation results for internal evaluation is expected.
In the United Kingdom (England), inspection involves ‘high stakes’ for providers; reports (including points for action and consideration) and performance profiles (including inspection grades) are published on the Internet, and the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) uses evidence from Ofsted inspections to make funding and accreditation decisions.
It is therefore taken for granted that inspection outcomes will be fed into self-evaluation.
In the United Kingdom (Scotland), the outcomes of the General Teaching Council for Scotland process will in turn feed back into the internal quality assurance processes of the university.
However, there is no explicit mention of this having to happen – simply an expectation that it will, as it is such an obvious thing to do.
In the Czech Republic (in the case of annual internal evaluation), Denmark, Luxembourg, Malta, Austria, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) and Iceland (in the case of regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions), no regulations on documents establishing internal evaluation criteria exist.
In Malta, however, regulations and content guidelines on initial teacher education as well as qualification standards for prospective teachers are usually used for this purpose.
As in external evaluation (see Section 2.3), internal evaluation may focus on issues such as the content of teacher education curricula, the teaching methods used, the balance between professional training and general education, school placements for student teachers, the trainer/student ratio or the general infrastructure of the higher education institution concerned.
Of the countries with official regulations on the scope of internal evaluation, most cover all (or almost all) of the above-mentioned issues.
While they have to be taken into account on a compulsory basis in many countries, consideration of them is either recommended or occurs on an optional basis in the Czech Republic (internal evaluation prior to external evaluation), Germany, Hungary (internal evaluation prior to external evaluation) and Romania.
Italy is the only country where the content of the teacher education curriculum is not taken into account in regulations on internal evaluation.
Some countries consider specific criteria other than those mentioned in Figure 3.4, such as organisational issues or student-focused social issues during internal evaluation.
In Greece, student welfare and the administrative services of the institution are also evaluated.
In Spain, as in the case of external evaluation, internal evaluation also focuses on criteria such as the management, planning, communication and organisation of teacher training courses, the specifications of the educational programme and activities concerned with improvement and review.
In Latvia, during the internal evaluation of a study programme (both for accreditation and reaccreditation purposes), special attention is also devoted to its development plan and to guaranteeing that it can provide for transfer to another programme or institution if for any reason it is discontinued.
In Portugal, the internal evaluation of universities and polytechnic institutes also has to take account of social support, the employment situation of graduates and their labour market integration, and social facilities.
The content and scope of internal evaluation may be very much conditioned by the needs of external evaluation in a number of countries, including the French Community of Belgium, the Czech Republic (in the case of the internal evaluation that takes place prior to external evaluation), Greece, Estonia, Spain, Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary (especially in the case of internal evaluation that occurs prior to external evaluation), Slovakia, the United Kingdom and Iceland (when the internal evaluation of higher education programmes occurs prior to external evaluation).
In Spain, both practices are encountered.
There are no official regulations on the precise scope of internal evaluation in the Czech Republic (in the case of annual internal evaluation), Denmark, France, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, Austria, Poland (in the case of teacher training colleges), Slovenia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom (England, Wales and Northern Ireland).
However, in France, the precise nature of provision, including teaching methods and arrangements to support students and facilitate their entry into the teaching profession, will be more and more often evaluated in accordance with the Livre des Références of higher education institutions.
The lack of regulations on the scope of internal evaluation in some countries does not imply that the issues actually covered differ greatly from the ones listed in Figure 3.4.
In Denmark, the university governing board determines the focus of internal evaluation.
The questionnaire typically covers teaching methods, human resources management, student achievements and students’ opinions on the education received and the balance between professional training and general education.
In Malta, almost all issues mentioned in the Figure are covered during the internal evaluation process.
In Austria, a case study of an evaluation carried out in 2001 at the Department of Teacher Education and School Research of the University of Innsbruck shows that, with respect to the internal evaluation of the quality of teaching, most issues listed in Figure 3.4 were covered.
There was also a focus on additional parameters, such as curriculum development and international cooperation.
As well as the quality of teaching, other areas of interest were the organisational structure, administration, tasks of the department, research, the provision of services, public relations and the development plan.
In Slovenia, the student opinion surveys used for internal evaluation usually include questions about various aspects of the course content, the appropriateness of the course workload and the teachers' and assistants’ ability to deliver the course.
The global reports established on this basis by the department and the faculty are used for gauging how students' perceptions vary over time or across disciplines, and for comparing student performance.
Issues such as the relevance of student gender and the appropriateness of the teaching methodology used are also addressed.
Figure 3.4: The scope of internal evaluation of initial teacher education for general education (ISCED 1-3), 2005/06
The content of the teacher education curriculum provided by the institution
Additional notes (Figure 3.4)
Latvia: (1) relates to the internal evaluation of a higher education institution for its accreditation, (2) to the internal evaluation of a study programme for accreditation, and (3) to the internal evaluation of a study programme for reaccreditation.
Although, in the internal evaluation of universities, school placements and partnerships with schools are not referred to directly, they are usually taken into account when preparing the selfevaluation report.
Slovenia: University rectors and deans must assume responsibility for quality.
Some of the issues shown in the table are therefore normally the focus of internal evaluation.
United Kingdom (ENG/WLS/NIR): There are no regulations as such, but external inspection criteria, which incorporate all of the issues mentioned, are an important influence.
The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general.
United Kingdom (SCT): The annual internal review process and matters to be considered externally are liable to cover similar ground.
Iceland: (1) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place before external evaluation, and (2) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions.
A variety of procedures or mechanisms may be used for internal evaluation.
For example, interviews or surveys may focus on the management of an institution or on its academic and administrative staff or students.
Classroom observation of student teachers being taught may be another way of collecting the information required for internal evaluation.
In most countries, all three types of interview mentioned above are used on a compulsory basis or are recommended.
In Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Spain and Bulgaria, they are used together with classroom observation.
Student interviews or surveys are the most widely used means of carrying out internal evaluation.
In Italy, Latvia (in the (re-)accreditation of study programmes) and Slovakia, they are the only compulsory procedure.
In Poland (in the case of teacher training colleges) and Romania, interviews or surveys of students are not foreseen.
Where internal evaluation refers to the (re-)accreditation of a study programme in Latvia, employers of former graduates are interviewed as well as students.
In Slovakia, students are obliged to complete questionnaires annually, focusing mainly on their satisfaction with teaching and learning.
In 13 countries and regions, there are no official regulations which lay down procedures and mechanisms for internal evaluation.
However, certain practices may exist.
In Denmark, internal evaluation is very often carried out as a written evaluation.
In Malta, all academic staff must develop a work forecast for every academic year, which is then discussed with the departmental head.
Each teacher’s performance is also appraised through a formal discussion.
In Slovenia, according to the internal rules of higher education institutions, student opinion surveys are used for the internal evaluation process.
In the United Kingdom (England and Wales), internal evaluation is expected but is not explicitly required.
Its format is not prescribed.
In England, for example, the new (2005-2011) Framework for Inspection places increased importance on the provider’s selfevaluation, and the accompanying Handbook offers guidance on how this can be carried out to the benefit of both inspectors and providers.
However, the inspectorate (Ofsted) cannot insist that a selfevaluation should be completed.
Figure 3.5: Procedures and mechanisms for the internal evaluation of initial teacher education for general education (ISCED 1-3), 2005/06
Greece: The information relates to the law on quality assurance in higher education issued in August 2005.
Frequency
In 13 countries, internal evaluation should occur on an annual basis.
In Bulgaria, it has to be carried out several times a year.
In ten countries or regions, higher education institutions have to undertake internal evaluation at fixed intervals of longer periods ranging from three to ten years.
In most of these countries, the timing depends on that of external evaluation.
This may mean that both types of evaluation must take place during the same academic year and amount to a single process.
Alternatively, it may mean that an internal evaluation must take place between two external evaluations, but not necessarily in the same year as an external evaluation. In Ireland, on the other hand, the timing of external evaluation is dependent on that of internal evaluation.
In Ireland, internal evaluation, which has to be carried out every ten years, results in external evaluation of the quality assurance procedures adopted by higher education institutions.
In Austria, both situations (external evaluation calling for internal evaluation and vice versa) may exist.
In the Czech Republic, Germany (universities and colleges of education providing bachelor’s and master’s programmes), Hungary and the United Kingdom (Scotland), institutions for teacher education have both to undertake annual internal evaluations and produce special evaluation reports when external evaluation occurs.
In Hungary, intermediate reports are additionally required every four years.
In all countries with procedures for accrediting programmes or institutions (see Figure 4.1), initial accreditation generally involves an internal evaluation.
In the nine countries or regions in which the frequency of internal evaluation is not determined by regulations, different scenarios are possible.
In the French Community of Belgium (universities), Spain, France (internal evaluations linked to evaluation by the IGAENR and CNE), Finland and Iceland, internal evaluation is meant to precede external evaluation, the frequency of which is not itself specified by regulations.
In the French Community of Belgium, France and Iceland, the body responsible for external evaluation decides when it should occur.
In Spain and Finland, higher education institutions are also involved in the decision to proceed with external evaluation (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5).
In Finland, the institutions must also conduct an internal evaluation independent of external evaluation, and determine its frequency.
In France (internal evaluation related to evaluation by the DES) and the United Kingdom (England and Wales), the (minimum) frequency of external evaluation is fixed but there is no obligation as such to carry out internal evaluation at the same time.

CHAPTER 4 USE MADE OF EVALUATION FINDINGS
The results of evaluation may be used in different ways, with direct or indirect repercussions for institutions or programmes.
Inadequate quality may, for example, mean that institutions have to draw up and implement a plan for improvement consisting of various measures, which may be subject to followup evaluation.
Penalties are also possible, as when an institution is no longer granted the right to award qualifications, or when its funding is adjusted.
Conversely, high-standard performance may lead to an increase in funding.
Over and above their consequences for institutions, the results of evaluation may also be made available to their staff, students and the general public.
Finally, evaluation findings from all institutions may be collated and summarised in national reports concerned with the quality of initial teacher education as a whole.
The following aspects are dealt with in this chapter: the possible consequences of evaluation for institutions or programmes; the availability of evaluation findings for their staff, students and the general public; the use of evaluation findings to prepare indicators or national reports on the state of the teacher education system as a whole.
In the vast majority of countries, regulations establish that the main possible consequences of external evaluation for teacher education programmes or institutions relate to their (re-)accreditation, the funding they receive or evaluation follow-up, depending on the case.
In just five countries or regions (the French Community of Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Austria and Finland), these aspects derive only marginally from regulations – if at all.
In the French Community of Belgium, the purpose of external evaluation is essentially to point the way forward for individual institutions.
It is intended that they should – entirely on their own initiative – introduce a procedure for reform inspired by the findings of external evaluation (which remain confidential).
However, in the end it is the government of the Community which decides on the possible consequences of external evaluation.
In Ireland and Finland, the use made of the external evaluation results is the responsibility of the institution evaluated.
In Finland, the external evaluation body (FINHEEC) usually undertakes a followup evaluation after three years.
Figure 4.1: Possible consequences of external and internal evaluation for institutions/programmes providing initial teacher education for general education (ISCED 1-3), 2005/06
Consequences of external evaluation: Impact on (re-)accreditation Impact on funding
Chapter 4 – Use made of Evaluation Findings
In the majority of countries, the findings of external evaluation provide the basis for a decision regarding the (re-)accreditation of institutions or programmes.
This means determining whether or not an institution may be officially recognised as satisfying the conditions required by accreditation standards.
The evaluation results are therefore used to take a major decision regarding institutions and their entitlement to provide teacher education and award the corresponding qualifications, and to obtain public funding.
Theoretically, if the results are poor, a programme may be discontinued or an institution closed.
In Lithuania, the United Kingdom (England and Wales) and Norway, there are forms of external evaluation whose main purpose is not to underpin a (re-)accreditation process, but which provide results that are used in a secondary way to inform accreditation decisions regarding teacher education programmes or institutions.
In Lithuania, evaluations conducted by the centre for quality assessment in higher education are geared as a priority to enhancing quality, but their results also feed into a (re-)accreditation process.
In the United Kingdom (England and Wales), one of the purposes of inspection is to check compliance with requirements.
If an (Ofsted or Estyn) inspection finds that the provision does not comply with accreditation requirements, this would be the trigger for the Training and Development Agency for Schools (England) or the Higher Education Funding Council (Wales) to consider starting withdrawal of accreditation.
In Norway, the agency for quality assurance in education evaluates all higher education institutions on a regular basis.
If the results are not satisfactory, the institution concerned may continue to offer its existing programmes but may not introduce any new ones until it has improved its performance.
The findings of external evaluation may also provide a basis for initiating a possible reaccreditation procedure.
To date, programmes for teacher education have not been the subject of such a procedure.
In countries with (re-)accreditation procedures, if the findings of external evaluation result in refusal to (re-)accredit programmes or institutions, this decision may have a bearing on the public funding they are awarded.
When a programme is concerned, funding is generally reorganised within the institution concerned, and its amount may remain stable.
However, in Spain and Sweden, the accreditation procedure cannot affect funding in any way.
The level of funding may also vary in accordance with the level of quality observed during external evaluation, as for example in the case of the United Kingdom (England and Wales).
The German-speaking Community of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany (in certain Länder), France and Portugal provide examples of external evaluation whose results are not used during any accreditation process but which may have an impact on the funding of institutions or programmes.
In the event of unfavourable evaluation in the German-speaking Community of Belgium, the institution concerned may have to repay the public funding awarded to it for operational purposes.
The teacher education institutions in France (Instituts universitaires de formations des maîtres – IUFMs) are evaluated by various bodies (see the annex).
The results of these evaluations are taken into account notably during negotiations to renew the four-year public funding contract.
In Portugal, positive findings may be an incentive to introduce new programmes or develop already existing ones.
Conversely, in the case of poor results, programmes may be suspended.
However, in practice, such situations have not yet been encountered.
In all countries where the use of the results of external evaluation is regulated, a decision is normally taken to arrange for followup when an institution or programme does not satisfy all required quality standards.
This generally involves an obligation on the part of the institution to draw up a plan for improvement and fresh external evaluation after a given period of time, which varies from one country to the next.
In Germany and France, the followup is optional.
In Greece and Iceland, the sole consequence of external evaluation for institutions is the implementation of a plan for improvement.
In most countries where the results of external evaluation are used to inform (re-)accreditation decisions, conditional or temporary accreditation may be awarded in the case of non-compliance with accreditation requirements.
This conditional accreditation is usually delivered for two or three years, and a followup is organised in the meantime.
In the Czech Republic, if the accreditation awarded to study programmes is subject to certain conditions, the faculty has to submit (generally within two years) a report on the fulfilment of imposed conditions.
In Latvia, a study programme may receive temporary accreditation (for two years) only once.
In the event of poor results in Hungary, the accreditation commission may propose that the minister of education should withdraw the entitlement of an institution to award qualifications for a given period and check that the necessary measures have been introduced.
In the case of conditional accreditation in Poland, institutions for teacher education have to implement a plan for improvement immediately, while the deadline for a fresh evaluation is established by the top-level education authorities.
As regards internal evaluation, regulations allow for the formulation of a plan for improvement in most countries.
The latter is compulsory in Belgium (the German-speaking Community), the Czech Republic (for annual internal evaluation), Denmark, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Lithuania, Poland, the United Kingdom (Scotland), Iceland (for the evaluation that occurs prior to external evaluation), Norway and Bulgaria.
A plan of this kind is recommended in the French Community of Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Slovakia and Romania, and is optional in Italy.
In around ten countries, institutions practise internal evaluation for which no regulations concerning a plan for improvement are issued.
This is due to the autonomy of institutions.
In France, Cyprus, Slovenia and Iceland, this internal evaluation is recommended and/or only sparingly regulated.
The lack of regulations about a plan for improvement also concerns compulsory internal evaluations that occur prior to external evaluation (the Flemish Community of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Hungary, the Netherlands and Portugal) as well as annual internal evaluations (Latvia in the case of study programme evaluation, Hungary and Sweden).
In the United Kingdom (England, Wales and Northern Ireland), there are no regulations concerning either a plan for improvement or the many other aspects of internal evaluation, which does not mean that such plans are not implicitly recommended.
In the majority of countries, the results of internal evaluation are also generally taken into account during external evaluation (see Figure 2.5), and in the case of poor results may represent one of the elements which prompt further external evaluation.
In Germany, external evaluation is not compulsory.
The management of universities or teacher training colleges – or the minister of education in the case of training institutes (Studienseminare) – are entitled to request an external evaluation if they consider this to be necessary in light of the internal evaluation results.
Beyond the ‘initial’ use of evaluation results which may directly affect the institutions (see Section 4.1), these findings may also be released for information to various players involved in the activities of the institutions or to the general public.
Regulations on the publication of individual external evaluation results for each institution or programme are very common.
In 19 countries, these results are published systematically.
However, systematic publication of internal evaluation results is only required in six countries (the Czech Republic for annual internal evaluation, Italy, Lithuania, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden).
In Spain and Latvia, the publication of the results of external and internal evaluations is optional.
In Spain, the institution evaluated decides whether the results are to be published.
In Slovenia and the United Kingdom (Scotland), the findings of external evaluation are not published as such, but they are available to the public indirectly.
In Slovenia, working meetings of the body responsible for external evaluation, the Council for Higher Education, are public.
Information is circulated via the press.
In the United Kingdom (Scotland), reports on external evaluation results are not formally published but they do go to a full meeting of the General Teaching Council for Scotland, and a record of its business is placed in the public domain.
In Norway, publication of the findings of internal evaluation is recommended, whereas in Germany, Greece, Hungary and the United Kingdom (Scotland) it is optional.
In the majority of countries, there are no regulations or recommendations on the publication of internal evaluation results.
However, it may nevertheless be common to publish these results.
In Ireland, internal and external evaluation reports are published on university websites.
This may also be the case in Spain.
In the other countries, the external evaluation reports may be published by the body responsible for external evaluation (Estonia, Greece, France – for the Comité national d’évaluation, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovakia and the United Kingdom (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)) or by the ministry of education (German-speaking Community of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Iceland and Romania), generally on their websites, or on the website of the independent umbrella organisations for higher education institutions (Flemish Community of Belgium).
In Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Iceland, Norway and Romania, the results of external evaluation are also published in brochures on education, congresses, press articles, etc.
The publication of evaluation findings means that they are available de facto to all those involved in the functioning of higher education.
However, almost all countries where publication of the findings of external evaluation is mandatory, also take steps to ensure that they are directly available to the management of institutions, and very often to their academic staff and students. By contrast, in Finland there is no special channel for communicating the results of external evaluation to members of the institution concerned.
In the French Community of Belgium and Poland (teacher training colleges), there are very few regulations on the publication of results and their accessibility within the institutions.
Only management has systematic access to results.
In Austria, the publication of external and internal evaluation results is not subject to any regulations, which may be due to a lack of regulations on evaluation in general.
In practice in this country, evaluation results are usually made available to the stakeholders.

Cyprus: The figure relates solely to the evaluation of colleges providing initial teacher education for primary education.
Latvia: As regards internal evaluation, solely the results of evaluation carried out during initial accreditation of institutions or programmes are published.
Luxembourg: For secondary education, the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad.
Hungary: (1) relates to the annual internal evaluation, and (2) to internal evaluation that occurs prior to external evaluation.
According to regulations, the results of annual internal evaluation must be available to the public, but the institution concerned decides whether or not to publish them.
Malta: Internal evaluation results are usually made available to academic staff and students.
Poland: (1) relates to the external evaluation of universities, and (2) to external evaluation of teacher training colleges.
Slovenia: According to internal institutional rules, internal evaluation results are published on the website of the faculty concerned.
They are also published in reports produced by the national higher education quality assessment commission.
United Kingdom: The information relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general.
Schools working in partnership with the institutions evaluated may access the findings of external evaluation in the majority of countries.
Circulation of internal evaluation findings within institutions is far less regulated than in the case of external evaluation, but the regulations concerned with this matter are slightly greater in number and sometimes more restrictive than those dealing with the publication of results.
In 11 countries, the results have to be available to academic staff and students.
In Estonia and Romania this practice is also recommended.
Monitoring of the education system pursues several aims.
It is intended to help control the system, provide reports on its quality and enable adjustments to enhance its performance.
It implies the need for comprehensive information on the system as a whole.
Findings from the evaluation of individual teacher education institutions/programmes – as summarised in reports or indicators giving an overall picture of the state of initial teacher education – may provide input for policy-making.
However, the preparation of national reports and indicators based on the evaluation reports of individual institutions is far from general practice.
Only the German-speaking Community of Belgium, Germany (in the case of external evaluation concerned with accreditation of bachelor’s- and master’s-type programmes), Greece, Ireland (for internal and external evaluation of teaching practice), Lithuania and the United Kingdom (England and Wales) produce both national reports and indicators, either for higher education or for initial teacher education in particular.
Page 50
Quality Assurancein Teacher Educationin Europe
Nine countries produce national reports, most often dealing with higher education in general. In the Netherlands, the findings from external evaluation are compiled in a general report on the state of the education system.
In Sweden, teacher education is dealt with specifically in national reports on higher education.
In Ireland and the United Kingdom (England, Wales and Northern Ireland), the reports and indicators also deal specifically with teacher education.
In addition, the inspectorates publish ad-hoc reports on specific aspects of teacher education.

Preparation of national indicators on initial teacher education
Belgium (BE de): The figure relates solely to the evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education.
For general secondary education, teacher education is provided outside the Community. Most teachers are trained in the French Community of Belgium.
Germany: Only the results of external evaluations to (re-)accredit bachelor’s and master’s programmes (which are being introduced in 12 of the 16 Länder) are the subject of national reports and indicators.
CHAPTER 5 ACCREDITATION AND EVALUATION OF IN-SERVICE TEACHER EDUCATION
Professional development for teachers may have various aims and address a variety of needs, from nationally identified educational priorities to the particular needs of schools or individual teachers.
It can take many organisational forms and may be offered by a wide range of training providers.
In several countries, the design of inservice education programmes has become completely decentralised and is the responsibility of schools.
As a consequence, schools and local education authorities offer training based on the skills and development needs of teachers and schools.
Given the variety of providers and the growing autonomy of schools to choose among them, the question of quality control is therefore becoming crucial.
The accreditation and evaluation of these providers of inservice teacher education is the focus of this chapter.
The following issues will be discussed in more detail: the existence of official regulations (or practices) affecting the accreditation and evaluation of providers; the main procedures involved; the one or more external bodies carrying out accreditation and/or evaluation; its scope; its frequency; the use made of results.
In the great majority of countries, all or almost all types of provider currently exist, except for some countries with only one or two providers, as illustrated in the examples below.
In Greece and Cyprus, public authority inservice teacher education centres are the only bodies offering provision.
In Luxembourg, inservice teacher education is only offered at higher education institutions and institutions for initial teacher education.
In Norway, higher education institutions are the sole providers of inservice teacher education.

Belgium (BE fr): The information relates solely to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière (in-service education institute) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of inservice education at joint level of all public and private providers (interréseaux).
Luxembourg: In September 2005, the minister of education announced the creation of an agency for school quality and an institute for inservice teacher education.
These two projects are currently being implemented.
Latvia: Programmes lacking approval may also be implemented, but only approved programmes are included in a list of compulsory inservice education courses for teachers.
Lithuania: Draft regulations on the evaluation of inservice teacher education are in the final phase of legal approval.
Their approval and a first evaluation are planned for 2006. Iceland: Evaluation of higher education institutions providing inservice teacher education has not yet been carried out.
The local authorities offer inservice training for primary and lower secondary teachers.
Teacher unions decide and plan inservice activities together with the higher education institutions.
Chapter 5 – Accreditation and Evaluation of In-Service Teacher Education
Independently of the number of existing providers, inservice teacher education providers are subject to regulations on accreditation and/or evaluation in the majority of countries. Both procedures are more or less represented on an equal basis.
In the German-speaking Community of Belgium, Sweden and Norway, the regulations referring to the evaluation of initial teacher education institutions or programmes also apply to the evaluation of inservice teacher education.
This means that inservice teacher education undergoes the same quality assessment as higher education.
In the French and German-speaking Communities of Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Sweden, Iceland and Norway, regulations only apply to the evaluation of inservice teacher education, whereas in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Finland, regulations refer exclusively to accreditation.
In these two countries, regulations on both accreditation and evaluation apply for certain providers only, whereas for other providers, regulations on only one of the two procedures apply.
In Ireland, regulations on the evaluation of inservice teacher education providers exist in the case of institutions for initial teacher education, teacher unions or associations and other providers such as NGOs or private companies, but not in the case of higher education institutions.
The situation is similar in Italy, where regulations on accreditation do not apply to higher education institutions or to institutions for initial teacher education.
In six countries (Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Finland, Sweden and Iceland) regulations apply to some, but not all established providers of inservice teacher education.
In Finland, only inservice teacher education of at least 30 ECTS provided by higher education institutions may be accredited by the FINHEEC at the request of the provider.
The contents of the course have to be relevant to the objectives and strategies of the institutions and the initial education of the participants.
In France, Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta, Austria and the United Kingdom, there are no regulations on either accreditation or evaluation of providers of inservice teacher education. In most of these countries, however, certain non-regulated evaluation or accreditation practices exist.
In France, the only procedure is a call for the provision of inservice teacher education. This is issued in each académie by the appropriate administrative authority, which decides whether or not to designate a particular body with responsibility for a particular type of training.
Although no regulations exist in Cyprus, evaluation of inservice education programmes is conducted by the Pedagogical Institute of the Ministry of Education and Culture.
In Malta, organisers are encouraged to review their courses by asking participants to fill in questionnaires.
In Austria, the Pädagogischen Institute (institutions for inservice teacher education) publish an annual report on their provision.
Furthermore, in England, the Training and Development Agency for Schools has an extended remit covering inservice education for teachers.
The process of accrediting and evaluating inservice teacher education providers may consist of several procedures, such as a site visit or analysis of a written plan, the selfevaluation report of the institution or other background documents.
In Spain, depending on the legislation of the Autonomous Community concerned, the evaluation of inservice teacher education providers consists of different elements.
Those referred to as ‘compulsory’ in Figure 5.2 are common to all Autonomous Communities, whereas those termed ‘optional’ reflect the situation of just some of them.

Initial teacher education abroad
Belgium (BE fr): The information relates solely to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière (in-service education institute) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of inservice education at joint level of all public and private providers (interréseaux).
Ireland: Data refer to both the external evaluation of a sample of inservice teacher education courses and the periodic evaluation of inservice teacher education providers.
Italy: (1) refers to higher education institutions and institutions for initial teacher education, and (2) to teacher unions or associations and private-sector training providers.
Lithuania: The draft regulations include almost all procedures on a compulsory basis. Slovenia: Data refer to accreditation only.
In eight countries (France, Cyprus, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Austria, Finland and the United Kingdom), there are no official regulations concerning the main procedures of the accreditation or evaluation process at all.
Concerning external evaluation, the main procedures in the other countries are the analysis of a written plan and site visits.
Almost all countries with official regulations, except Denmark, Sweden, Iceland and Norway, analyse a written plan.
A site visit is one of the main procedures in most countries that have regulations. In the French Community of Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain (in some Autonomous Communities), Italy (in the case of teacher unions or associations or private-sector training providers), Hungary and Slovenia, this visit is optional only.
It is recommended in the German-speaking Community of Belgium and Slovakia and is optional in Slovenia.
In the countries where internal evaluation is compulsory or recommended, it is usually also compulsory or recommended to analyse the selfevaluation report during external evaluation.
Different external bodies may be responsible for accrediting and/or evaluating providers of inservice teacher education.
Responsibility may lie with an evaluation agency or committee, the ministry of education, an independent body (e.g. an audit agency) working on behalf of the public authority, an inspectorate specifically established for school education or inservice teacher education, external evaluation experts or other bodies depending on the particular country.
In most countries and regions, only one body is responsible for this kind of accreditation and evaluation. This is normally an evaluation agency or committee or the ministry of education.
In line with the decentralised structure of Germany and Spain, the bodies undertaking accreditation and/or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Autonomous Community to the next.
Given the principle of cultural sovereignty in Germany, the general supervision of inservice teacher education is the task of the ministries in each of the 16 Länder.
As regards evaluation and accreditation of the workshops, courses and programmes offered by the various providers, many Länder have established or appointed central institutes or agencies for this task.
As an independent body, the Accreditation Council (Akkreditierungsrat) also takes part in accreditation and evaluation.

Cyprus: A research and evaluation unit is currently being established within the Ministry of Education and Culture for systematic evaluation of all the levels of education as well as for inservice teacher education.
Lithuania: Draft regulations include an agency for evaluation within the ministry of education.
Finland: Inservice teacher education of at least 30 ECTS provided by higher education institutions may be accredited by the FINHEEC at the request of the provider.
Iceland: Evaluation of higher education institutions providing inservice teacher education has not yet been carried out.
In Denmark, Hungary and Poland, several bodies are involved in the accreditation and evaluation process.
In Denmark, the authority to accredit inservice teacher training is vested in the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Science, Technology and Development. External evaluation, however, is generally carried out by the Danish Evaluation Institute (EVA).
In Hungary, the process occurs at three levels. At preparatory level, the organiser of the programme asks an expert from the National Register of Experts to give an opinion on it.
In a second stage, an expert from the Pedagógus-továbbképzési Akkreditációs Testület (In-service Teacher Training Accrediting Body) evaluates the programme in accordance with a guideline based on legal regulations and then prepares a proposal to the minister on the decision of approval of the programme.
The National Committee for In-Service Teacher Training (Országos Pedagógus-továbbképzési Bizottság) also takes part in controlling the programmes.
In Poland, depending on the course evaluated, two different bodies carry out evaluation.
The ministry of education evaluates and accredits inservice teacher education courses offered by the National Centre of In-Service Teacher Training.
It also decides whether to recognise qualification courses for practising teachers which are offered by institutions for initial teacher education during afternoons, weekends or summer.
The heads of regional education authorities (kuratoria), which are subordinate to the ministry, evaluate and accredit qualification courses offered by all other providers.
An agency for evaluation or an evaluation committee carries out accreditation and/or evaluation in the Flemish Community of Belgium, Germany (some Länder), Hungary, Slovenia, Finland, Norway and Bulgaria.
In the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Hungary, Poland (in the case of courses offered by the National Centre of In-Service Teacher Training and by institutions for initial teacher education), Slovakia and Iceland, the ministry of education, one of its departments or a ministry commission carries out the accreditation and/or evaluation or shares responsibility for the process.
In Denmark, either the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation carry out accreditation.
In Greece, evaluation is carried out by a committee of counsellors and educational consultants from the Pedagogical Institute of the ministry of education, who are responsible for the inservice teacher education of newly appointed state school teachers.
They are supported by a team of statisticians specially engaged by the Pedagogical Institute for this purpose.
In Slovakia, the Accreditation Commission for Further Education was established at the ministry of education to coordinate cooperation of individual providers with higher education institutions.
Inservice teacher education is controlled by the ministry through organisations such as methodicaleducational centres, the National Institute for Education and other educational institutions.
In five countries (Denmark, in some German Länder, the Netherlands, Portugal and Romania), an independent body working on behalf of the public authority is responsible for the accreditation and/or evaluation of providers.
Finally, an inspectorate for school education undertakes the accreditation and/or evaluation of inservice teacher education providers in the German-speaking Community of Belgium, some German Länder, Ireland and Poland.
In the German-speaking Community of Belgium and Ireland, the inspectorate is part of the ministry of education.
An inspectorate for inservice teacher education exists only in Hungary (the National Committee for In-Service Teacher Training), where it participates in evaluation along with other bodies.
In the French Community of Belgium, the Institut de la formation en cours de carriere, a community-wide institution, organises and evaluates inservice teacher education, notably through its operators.
In Latvia, an expert evaluates the programme in question on behalf of the approval commission for further teacher education programmes.
The expert then submits a report to the appropriate approval commission for such programmes (depending on the type of programme concerned), which then decides whether or not to approve the programme.
In Luxembourg, there are no regulations applicable to the bodies that accredit or evaluate inservice teacher education.
These aspects include the content of the programme, the teaching methods used, the human resources available, the quality of teaching, the views of participants on the activity provided and whether it met their expectations, and whether particular aspects of the infrastructure such as teaching material met the required standards.
In almost half of the countries considered, there are no regulations on the scope of accreditation and/or evaluation.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the issues mentioned in Figure 5.4 are not usually covered.

Lithuania: Draft regulations include the content of the activity, competences of trainers and infrastructure as the scope of accreditation and evaluation.
Explanatory note Financial audits and administrative controls are not taken into consideration.
In many countries where regulations exist, all or almost all issues mentioned are covered.
In the majority of them, the content of the activity as well as the teaching methods and/or the competences of the trainers are taken into account.
Infrastructure (such as teaching material, technical equipment) is also quite often evaluated. Participants’ opinions on the training they receive are considered in eight countries.
The German-speaking Community of Belgium, Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and/or accreditation of inservice teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education.
These regulations take all aspects mentioned into account.
Several countries mention a variety of other aspects.
Consistency between content and organisation of the activity and the educational aims seems to be one of the most important aspects.
In Denmark, accreditation of a new programme focuses on issues such as the duration and organisation of study (i.e. part- or full-time), admission requirements, the target group (e.g. their educational background or work experience) and a description of future quality assurance methods.
In Spain, certain Autonomous Communities are more highly regulated regarding the scope of accreditation/evaluation. This is the case in the Autonomous Community of Asturias, where the focus is also on how the Regional Plan is designed and executed and how the training is coordinated, the usefulness of the training, and the quality/quantity of teaching materials used.
In Ireland, evaluation also focuses on the relevance of the course to the primary school curriculum and the extent to which the activity complies with official policy and guidelines.
In Hungary, the focus is on whether the programme is explicit in aims and designed for the respective target group(s), and on the additional value it gives to the teachers to be trained.
The detailed content requirements are compared with the goals of the respective training programme and with the data given by the programme organiser.
Moreover, evaluation analyses whether the programme emphasises successful learning and how the issues presented can be put into practice.
The provider is responsible for the quality of implementation, programme objectives, tasks and planned results.
In Romania, the accreditation process takes a set of criteria and conditions into account, such as the legality of the institution and the existence of the necessary training space, the utility of the training programme (i.e. its concordance with the national policies and strategies for education development, inservice education standards, training priorities specified at national level and its adequacy for the target group), the existence of counselling offers and time management (i.e. time allocation, the duration of training sessions and their organisation into full-time or part-time courses, evening classes, distance education, etc.).
Chapter 5 – Accreditation and Evaluation of In-Service Teacher Education
The frequency of evaluation and/or accreditation procedures in the context of inservice education is regulated in only 12 countries.
Although regulations do not exist in Cyprus, Ireland and Slovakia, practices show a pattern of regularity.

Belgium (BE fr): The information only relates to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière.
Belgium (BE de): Evaluation takes place in the context of external evaluation of higher education institutions, which also offer inservice teacher education.
Spain: Frequency varies, although it generally takes place once a year, depending on the Autonomous Community.
Ireland: A sample of all inservice programmes is evaluated annually.
Italy: Evaluation should be carried out periodically.
Legislation does not specify further.
Even in countries where the frequency is regulated, situations are quite complex and vary depending on the procedure followed (self-evaluation, external evaluation or accreditation).
In Greece, external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme, while internal evaluation takes place three times a year, at the end of each phase of the programme (three phases in total).
In Hungary, new programmes can be accredited every year or whenever applications are made.
Programme providers can decide to start inservice education programmes anytime.
However, the accreditation procedure coordinated by the Inservice Teacher Training Accrediting Body is the condition for starting a programme.
Programmes are then accredited for five years. If providers want to continue their programmes after the fifth year, they must go through the accreditation procedure again.
Programme providers are also required to carry out selfevaluation procedures.
Furthermore, the SuliNova Kht (a non-profit organisation) monitors inservice teacher education programmes by means of a selfevaluation questionnaire.
In Poland, the ministry of education supervises and approves the National Centre of Inservice Training activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year.
Every year, the Regional Educational Authorities (kuratoria) provide the ministry with the conclusions concerning the performance of inservice teacher education institutions in their respective region. Another obligation of the REA
Quality Assurancein Teacher Educationin Europe imposed by ministry regulations is to organise and measure the quality of work of all the educational institutions in the region (including inservice teacher training institutions) once every five years.
In Slovenia, according to regulations which have been in place since the 2004/05 school year, only part of inservice courses are accredited each year.
In 2005, for instance, the programme council decided to review the cluster of refresher courses and courses for the professional development of teachers.
In 2006, courses on whole-school issues will be the focus of evaluation.
The results of the accreditation and evaluation of inservice education may be used in different ways, with repercussions for institutions or programmes, similar to the evaluation of initial teacher education (Chapter 4).
In the Czech Republic, accreditation is awarded by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports on recommendation of the Accreditation Commission.
The Ministry has the right to control the accredited programmes during the period of accreditation (three years), but so far no rules on the procedures have been prepared.
In the event that the provider does not fulfil the programme, the accreditation can be withdrawn.
The maintainer of a school may check if inservice programmes for teachers correspond to the pedagogical programme of the school.
In Latvia, the commission has the right to withdraw approval given to a programme if there is proof that it has failed to meet requirements.
In Poland, negative evaluation findings can result in the accreditation for a given institution to be withdrawn and the financial means planned for inservice courses to be channelled into other training institutions.
In Portugal, there is an initial accreditation process for the institution or programme.
This accreditation may be temporarily or permanently withdrawn if there is proof of irregularities.
In Slovenia, the main aim of an accreditation procedure is for formal programme offers to be selected following a public tender.
Evaluation findings are generally also used for improvement of provision.
In Greece, the evaluation findings of inservice teacher education are used as feedback for better programme development in the following year.
In Spain, the Autonomous Communities use the results to elaborate an annual report on teacher training to improve the quality of the inservice teacher training system.
In Cyprus, although no regulations exist, evaluation findings are used for decision-making with respect to the goals, processes and instructors of the programmes.
In Austria, although no regulations exist, evaluation results from both individual training courses and programmes help the institutions to assure quality, develop programmes, and adapt their programmes to the needs of teachers and schools.
Evaluation and accreditation results may also be provided as information to various players involved in the planning of inservice teacher education activities.
In the Netherlands, accreditation results are published on the website of the Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie (NVAO, or Accreditation Organisation of The Netherlands and Flanders).
In Ireland, a copy of the evaluation report, which may include recommendations for improvement, is sent to the course providers.
These reports are then sent to the Council for Programmes of Continuing Education and Training of Professional Staff of Schools and Kindergartens.
On the basis of these reports, an overall national report is prepared and is discussed and assessed by the Council before being sent to the minister of education.
In Romania, accredited teacher training programmes are published in a list used by teachers for the selection of the inservice training course that they must attend every five years.
CHAPTER 6 REFORMS AND DEBATE
A variety of important influences affect the evaluation of teacher education in Europe.
First, institutions or programmes for initial teacher education are in general part of higher education and are therefore also
These reforms have been referred to in previous chapters.
The debates and reforms described below are concerned with two main questions which relate directly to teacher education.
Many countries have begun reforms of the organisation of initial teacher education and inservice training sometimes in relation to the Bologna process, or are intending to do so.
The situation in some of these countries, which have planned to adapt procedures for evaluating teacher education, is the subject of the first section.
A limited number of countries are currently engaged in debates concerned with the quality of evaluation procedures in teacher education. Such debates are described in the second section.
This last trend is becoming increasingly more widespread in Europe.
The introduction of the two-cycle (bachelor/master) structure in several Länder in Germany has rapidly demonstrated how important it is that they should mutually recognise qualifications obtained by teachers within this new structure.
Later, it was established in a resolution passed in April 2005 that, in order to be granted this recognition, courses had to be structured in modules, accredited and therefore evaluated beforehand.
By means of agencies and other bodies for evaluation set up for this purpose it has been possible also to evaluate forms of initial teacher education not provided in accordance with the two-cycle structure, as well as inservice training courses.
The previous system of evaluation sought to ensure that the regulations were complied with.
Ongoing debate on the evaluation of initial and inservice education is examining how far evaluation of this kind should become general practice and whether it achieves its aims.
In Estonia, a national plan for the development of teacher education has been established. It includes a brief description of the skills that graduate teachers should possess and the main aims of national policies for initial teacher education.
Later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it, including professional standards, the skills of teachers and compulsory requirements as regards teacher education programmes.
In Italy, the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform. A decree on the definition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government.
The decree includes definitions of the criteria and procedures for monitoring and evaluating the outcome of teacher education provided as part of the master programme.
The decree is not yet implemented, as further decisions are still required concerning the curriculum and recruitment procedures to be connected with initial education.
In Latvia, improvements in the system of inservice teacher education, which are currently being discussed, are expected to involve the evaluation of providers and not just programmes.
In the United Kingdom (Wales), the Welsh Assembly Government has invited the General Teaching Council for Wales to take the lead working with other partners to develop a professional development framework for Wales.
The proposed structure provides for clearly defined standards to govern career progression, and special evaluation arrangements. It is planned that inservice training programmes will be accredited and the quality of providers evaluated.
In the case of quality assurance, recommendations should be submitted to the Welsh Assembly Government by January 2007.

Accreditation: Process by which an institution or a programme is judged by the relevant legislative and professional authorities as having met predetermined standards in order to provide (teacher) education or training and to award the corresponding qualifications (where they exist).
Synonyms: Recognition, validation.
Concurrent model: An initial teacher education programme which, from the outset, combines general teacher education in one or more subjects with theoretical and practical professional teacher training.
Consecutive model: A two-stage initial teacher education programme.
Students first receive general education in order to obtain a degree in a particular subject or branch of study.
At or near the end of this period of study, they enrol in a programme of initial professional training, enabling them to qualify as teachers.
Deaccreditation: A result of an evaluation process that takes away from an institution the permission to continue to provide one or several (teacher) education or training programmes and to award the corresponding qualifications.
Evaluation: The general process of a systematic and critical analysis leading to judgments and/or recommendations for improvement regarding the quality of a (teacher) education institution or programme.
Synonyms: Assessment, audit, peer review, quality assessment, review.
Evaluation criteria: Checkpoints by which the attainment of certain objectives and/or standards can be examined.
They describe the characteristics of the requirements and conditions to be met, and therefore provide the (quantitative and/or qualitative) basis on which an evaluative conclusion is drawn.
Expert in evaluation: A person experienced and qualified in the evaluation of institutions and/or its staff.
S/he may have various professional backgrounds, for example in research, teaching or management positions.
External evaluation: The process whereby a specialised external body collects data, information and evidence about an institution or a programme, in order to make a statement about its quality.
External evaluation is normally carried out by a team of external experts, peers or inspectors. Synonym: External review.
General teacher education: General courses and mastery of the subject(s) that trainees will teach when qualified.
The purpose of these courses, therefore, is to provide trainees with a thorough knowledge of one or more subjects and good general knowledge.
Inspector: A person evaluating the quality of educational provisions who works within the body of an educational authority.
S/he may be trained as a teacher and/or have an administrative background.
Internal evaluation: A process carried out under the responsibility of those working within an institution, consisting of the systematic collection of administrative data and the questioning of students, lecturers and other staff.
It may be considered as a collective institutional reflection and an opportunity for quality enhancement.
Synonym: Self-evaluation.
Peer: Academic of the same higher education discipline, specialist in the field reviewed.
Works outside of the institution/programmes evaluated.
Professional teacher training: Part of the initial teacher education programme which provides future teachers with both theoretical and practical insight into their future profession.
In addition to courses in psychology and teaching methodology, it includes short and (usually) unremunerated in-class placements (supervised by the teacher in charge of the class concerned and with periodic assessment by teachers at the training institution).
Qualification standards: A set of core competencies, relevant knowledge and skills within a study programme, i.e. everything a future teacher should know and be able to do.
This level of requirements must be attained by student teachers in order to obtain a teaching qualification.
Qualification standards shape what goes into the curriculum of the teacher education programme and may be defined within the framework of official guidelines for initial teacher education.
Quality assurance: An all-embracing term referring to an ongoing, continuous process of evaluating (assessing, monitoring, guaranteeing, maintaining and improving) the quality of (teacher) education systems, institutions or programmes.
Synonym: Quality control.
Recommendation: Non-statutory guidelines which are of an advisory nature, issued by the top-level education authorities.
Regulation: A law, decree or any other officially binding document, issued by the top-level education authorities.
Site visit: A component of external evaluation.
It consists of external experts visiting a (teacher) education institution to examine the internal evaluation report produced by the institution, analyse background documents and/or interview faculty members, students and other staff in order to assess quality and effectiveness.
Standards: Statements regarding an expected level of requirements and conditions against which quality is assessed, or which must be attained by institutions or students in order for them to be accredited or certified.
In order to judge properly whether a particular standard is met or not, it has to be formulated clearly and explicitly and related to evaluation criteria, which can be further divided into (more operational) indicators.
International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 1997)
The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is an instrument suitable for compiling statistics on education internationally.
For more information on ISCED 97, readers should consult the official website: http://unescostat.unesco.org/en/pub/pub0.htm.
ISCED 1: Primary education
This level begins between 5 and 7 years of age, is compulsory in all countries and generally lasts from four to six years.
ISCED 2: Lower secondary education
It continues the basic programmes of the primary level, although teaching is typically more subject-focused.
Usually, the end of this level coincides with the end of compulsory education.
In some countries compulsory education is provided in a single structure without a transition between the primary and lower secondary levels.
ISCED 3: Upper secondary education
This level generally begins at the end of compulsory education.
The entrance age is typically 15 or 16 years.
Entrance qualifications (end of compulsory education) and other minimum entry requirements are usually needed.
Instruction is often more subject-oriented than at ISCED level 2.
The typical duration of ISCED level 3 varies from two to five years.

Preface
Every education system and national education policy uses its own specific terminology to describe the characteristics of its organisation and operation.
In trying to understand and make reliable comparisons of how the various education systems in Europe really work, we are often confronted with questions of terminology.
The development of precise ‘markers’ for reference purposes is thus absolutely essential for better mutual understanding and to encourage good quality communication in an enlarged Europe in which student and teaching staff mobility, as well as the openness of education and training systems to the world at large, are essential aims of cooperation.
For these reasons, the Eurydice Network in 1999 launched a series entitled the European Glossary on Education.
Four volumes have already been published. They are concerned respectively with examinations, qualifications and titles (a second edition appeared in 2004), educational institutions (a second edition appeared in 2005), teaching staff (2002) and management, monitoring and support staff (2003).
This fifth volume covers national terms used to denote bodies with responsibilities in the area of decision-making, advisory, operational or regulatory duties, or responsibilities concerned with quality assurance, in higher education in all Member States of the European Union (except Ireland) and the EFTA/EEA countries (except Norway).
Turkey which is also a member of the Eurydice Network did not contribute to this Glossary.
The present volume belongs to a set of publications that Eurydice is producing in 2007 to provide greater insight into interrelated aspects of higher education.
These publications are the 2007 edition of Focus on the Structure of Higher Education in Europe: following up the Bologna process (May 2007), Key Data on Tertiary Education (April 2007) and a study on governance in higher education (scheduled for the end of the year).
A guide to the use of the Glossary is presented by way of introduction.
It contains all relevant definitions and outlines the different aspects covered in the explanatory note on each term.
This fifth volume is the result of very close cooperation between the Eurydice National Units and the Eurydice European Unit (EEU).
The National Units provided the list of terms by country together with their explanatory notes, in accordance with a Guide to content.The material was then analysed by the EEU in consultation with individual National Units to improve the consistency and clarity of all terms and definitions.
By making this Glossary available to all who attempt to compare, understand or translate terms specific to the field of education, the Eurydice Network hopes to make a further contribution to the greater transparency of education systems in Europe.

Decision-making, Advisory, Operational and Regulatory Bodies in Higher Education
The fifth volume of the European Glossary on Education consists of a compilation of national terms used to denote formal bodies whose remit relates primarily to higher education (ISCED 5 and 6) (1
) in 28 education systems in Europe. It covers almost 770 national terms used during 2006.
This glossary covers bodies with responsibilities in the area of decision-making, advisory, operational or regulatory duties, or responsibilities concerned with quality assurance in higher education.
For the purposes of this glossary, a formal body is defined as a public or private entity recognised in law by the public authorities.
It has a specific role, responsibilities, functioning and constitution/membership.
It may be known as a board, council, institution, agency, etc.
All bodies with responsibilities in fields directly linked to higher education (such as the curriculum, evaluation, accreditation, the training and conditions of service of teachers), bodies responsible for funding higher education including agencies for the award of financial support, and all course or study programme information services come within the scope of this glossary.
Interest groups/unions constituted in formal bodies, such as teacher associations and unions, are covered only if they have a central/regional area of responsibility and are mainly concerned with higher education and consulted by policy-makers.
All types of higher education (academic, professional, artistic, etc.) including adult education and distance education are covered.
National terms denoting the ministry of education (and in certain cases the department within it responsible for higher education) or the ministry of higher education are the subject of separate entries, as are other ministries if they are fully responsible for certain branches of study in higher education (such as medicine, national defence and artistic studies).
On the other hand, the names of ministries that share certain responsibilities with the ministry of education or of higher education (for example, the ministry of finance) do not appear as an entry in the glossary. A list of all ministries involved in such partnerships is included under the summary table in the second part of the publication.
The Glossary does not include terms that denote the following:
− bodies responsible for areas that have no direct link with educational activity and are instead focused on social, logistic or cultural aspects of education (such as student health, the organisation of transport, cultural life and sports activities);centres and offices carrying out research into education (even if this is commissioned by the ministry); the national offices of ENIC/NARIC (with the exception of those that deal with tasks related to higher education at national level in addition to their responsibilities linked to the network);
Decision-making, Advisory, Operational and Regulatory Bodies in Higher Education
Legal status, formal connection with government, the degree of dependence of the body on the government.Date of establishment (particularly where there is a connection with the Bologna Process).Funding (public/private funding sources).
Main roles and tasks of the body (decision-making, advisory, regulatory, operational).The area(s) of education that the body deals with (study programmes, teacher qualifications, evaluation, appeals, information, administration, finance, etc.).The margin of autonomy that the body has in decision-making, areas in which they have autonomy, their eventual sharing of autonomy with public higher authorities (only for the bodies situated at institutional level in higher education).Main procedures dealt with by the body.
According to the type of body described, they are briefly explained: - decisionmaking procedures (in consultation with other bodies, by vote, etc.);- evaluation/accreditation procedures (visits, producing reports, publications, etc.);- other procedures (e.g. appointment of external participants by a body).Target groups and types of education of which the body is in charge (i.e. distance learning, artistic education, adult education).
The stakeholders that are represented on the body and on its governing board, whether they are elected or appointed and by whom.The appointment procedure of the head/chair of the body.The existence of restrictions that apply with respect to the appointment of representatives/chair.Whether there is a regulation on the number of representatives (minimum/maximum number of members, relative distribution amongst stakeholders).The term of office of the members/chair.The internal structure/subdivision within the body (sub-committees, groups of experts).Whether the body is permanently staffed or not.
The explanatory notes for ministries or higher education departments include the information covered by the items in categories‘Functions and procedures’ and ‘Constitution/internal organisation’.
Information on ‘Legal and administrative framework’ as well as the description of administrative activities are not provided.
Information on the internal structures of ministries/higher education departments specifically relates to higher education.
Where a formal body that appears as an entry in the glossary has its own website, the address is placed at the end of the explanatory note in addition to the list of useful websites in the second part of the glossary under the summary table.
All cross-references to other terms explained in the glossary are marked by an arrow (�).

Another task of the committee is to evaluate applications to establish and grant state recognition to higher education institutions and faculties, new study programmes, and national education and outcome requirements as framework requirements for all degree programmes. A new higher education act came into effect in 2006 and new Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes now replacing traditional, single stream college or university programmes, all require accreditation.
The activities of the committee will continue to have a twofold focus from a methodological standpoint. On the one hand, it performs accreditation by identifying the quality of institutions, faculties, and programmes in relation to predetermined threshold quality requirements (i.e. minimum standards involving approval, conditional approval or withholding of approval); on the other and above the threshold level, it committee provides a detailed assessment and recommendations regarding the quality enhancement of each given institution, faculty, or programme.
In other words, beyond the so-called ‘control’ function (through expressing an opinion to the minister), the committee also performs an advisory function in the promotion of quality enhancement, a role to which it intends to attach increasing importance in the future.
The committee always has 29 full statutory members delegated by higher education institutions, research institutes and professional organisations.
These members receive their letters of appointment from the Prime Minister, and additional non-voting members are appointed to cover all the main disciplines.
Programme officers are assigned several expert committees whose work they prepare and guide from the inception of each report to its completion.
These officers are also responsible for several institutions, and for preparing and taking part in site visits and helping to write the accreditation report.

Vereniging van Samenwerkende Nederlandse Universiteiten Country: The Netherlands Level: Central Explanatory note: The Association of Universities in the Netherlands is an organisation that represents the interests of 14 Dutch universities. The principal goal of the association is to strengthen the position of university education and research in society.
It represents the interests of the universities vis-à-vis political, governmental and community organisations. It is also an employers’ organisation that negotiates with the government and with organisations of employees about the working conditions of university staff.
Broadly speaking, it negotiates on behalf of the universities on the subject of working conditions and labour relations within the university sector, and establishes the collective labour agreement.
Individual academic subject areas are represented in the Disciplineoverlegorganen, or consultative bodies of disciplines. Acronym: VSNU. (http://www.vsnu.nl)
This Hochschule and its management board have been established under the special decree of 21 February 2005, and are the result of the closure of three higher education institutions following an agreement between the three educational providers that administered these institutions until the end of the 2004/05 academic year.
The financial resources of the Autonome Hochschule that the Verwaltungsrat has to manage are essentially public funds deriving from an annual grant included in the budget of the Ministry of the Germanspeaking Community.
The operational expenditure of the board itself is covered by the budget of the Hochschule.
These 8 members then jointly designate 1 member (plus 1 deputy member) representing the educational sector (pre-primary and primary), 1 member (plus 1 deputy member) representing the health sector and one member (plus 1 deputy member) representing the economic or cultural sector.
The management board may invite experts to its meetings, as well as one staff representative per department.
In principle, decisions are taken by simple majority vote subject to a quorum of six members. In compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in higher education, decisionmaking is totally autonomous.
However, a government commissioner (with advisory status) on the Verwaltungsrat der Autonomen Hochschule ensures that its decisions do indeed comply with laws and regulations and do not endanger the financial stability of the Hochschule. The Autonome Hochschule provides threeyear training for a recognised nursing qualification at postsecondary level (ISCED 4).
The management board is thus also responsible for provision at this level.
The board may confer decisionmaking powers on the director or the �฀Akademischer Rat.
The �฀Studentenrat der Autonomen Hochschule (student council) must be informed about decisions of the board with a direct bearing on students, and must be heard by the board if it so requests.

Visiterende en Beoordelende Instantie Country: The Netherlands Grammatical variants: Visiterende en Beoordelende Instanties Level: Educational institution Explanatory note: Visiting and assessment bodies commissioned by an institution to evaluate the quality of a study programme.
The external evaluations of these bodies are checked by the �฀Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatieorganisatie.
The criteria for accrediting existing programmes and for validating new ones are laid down in frameworks.The bodies base their evaluation on the frameworks and determine their own protocol within the limits set by them.
The procedure adopted by bodies to evaluate the quality of programmes is contained in these protocols.
The bodies and visiting committees established by them have to satisfy certain quality criteria.
For this reason, the legislature obliges the Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatieorganisatie to compile an annual list of organisations which, in its view, do so.
Evaluations have to be carried out in accordance with the accreditation framework of the Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatieorganisatie which considers, first, whether a visiting and assessment body satisfies the requirements for inclusion in the list and, secondly, whether the evaluation report offers a sufficient basis for the Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatieorganisatie to accredit the programme concerned.
Where an institution decides to have the evaluation carried out by a body not on the list, the Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatieorganisatie decides in retrospect whether enough has been done to guarantee the quality of the evaluation and the evaluation report.

Specific national characteristics
One essential characteristic in the case of Belgium is that, since 1989, education policy (in particular) is no longer a national responsibility but one assumed by the three Communities – the Flemish Community, the French Community and the Germanspeaking Community – as federated entities.
An important feature of the Germanspeaking Community is its small size (73 000 inhabitants in an area of 854 km² to the east of the country), which explains why higher education is provided on only a modest scale.
Indeed, within this essentially rural region, the long-standing tradition among its inhabitants has been to leave it when intending to begin higher education.
For what is very nearly a century since the region first belonged to Belgium, the vast majority (an estimated 80-90 %) of those who have entered higher education have done so in French-speaking Belgium and thus studied in French, while the remainder have preferred to study in their mother tongue, German, mainly in Germany. The percentage of those who undertake studies in Germany has been rising for some 20 years.
With effect from 2005/06, therefore, there is in the Germanspeaking Community just one higher education institution with two departments, namely health sciences and nursing, on the one hand, and teaching theory and practice, on the other.
In the Germanspeaking Community, there is only one ministry (Ministerium der Deutschsprachigen Gemeinschaft) consisting of four departments, including that of education and training (Abteilung Unterricht und Ausbildung).
BELGIUM (FLEMISH COMMUNITY)
Bodies
Local Regional
Belgium has turned into a federation of three Communities.
The Dutch-speaking north is home to the Flemish Community, which covers around 6 million inhabitants.
Each Community has its own legislative council and government.
Regionalism has given the Communities a large measure of self-governance.
They are, for example, fully autonomous regarding education.

Ministries that share certain responsibilities with the Ministry of Education are the Ministry of Health, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works, and the Ministry of Transport.
All of them cooperate closely in the development of secondary legislation concerning the training of students and upgrading of qualifications, and the fixing of any numerus clausus.
The Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Defence are also involved in curriculum and syllabus development.

In higher education (ISCED 5) in the Czech Republic, there are different types of institution, namely vyšší odborné školy (tertiary professional schools at ISCED 5B) and vysoké školy (higher education institutions at ISCED 5A).
They are subject to different laws and thus different approaches on the part of the Ministry. Tertiary professional schools are regulated by the Education Act which also applies to pre-school, basic and secondary education.
Their founders are regions. Higher Education Institutions are autonomous and regulated by the Act on Higher Education Institutions.
This act deals mainly with public HEIs.
Private HEIs are also the subject of different laws depending on their legal status.
State HEIs are under the direct control of their founding ministries.

The Spanish education system is a decentralised one.
The State Administration is responsible for drawing up the general educational framework as well as the National Core Curriculum, whereas the 17 Autonomous Communities have their own competences as regards governance and resources in the field of education. As far as higher education is concerned, Spanish universities have full autonomy to establish and administer their own general educational guidelines.
Private establishments come under a ministry (the Ministry of Education in most cases, but also Industry and Agriculture).
Out of 226 schools or training courses for engineers, around 160 have public status.
Out of the 144 schools for engineers that are members of the Conférence des Grandes Écoles (see explanatory note), 103 have public status: 62 come under the Ministry of Education, 12 under Agriculture, 10 Defence, 11 Industry, 5 Equipment, 2 the City of Paris and 1 Finance.
By contrast, the state-recognised Management Grandes Écoles almost all have consular status (for example, out of the 32 Grandes Écoles that are members of the Chapter of Grandes Écoles, 25 have consular status).
Out of 19 private educational institutions that are members of the Conférence des Grandes Écoles, one is the responsibility of the Prime Minister, 4 that of the Ministry of Education, 5 the Ministry of Agriculture, 4 the Ministry of Defence, one the Ministry of Finance, 2 the Ministry of Culture, one the Ministries of Culture and Industry and one a Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

At ISCED level 5B, there are essentially three supervisory ministries: the Ministry of Agriculture for the training of higher agricultural technicians in agricultural lycées, the Ministry of Health for the training of nurses and other paramedical staff, and the Ministry of Social Affairs for training social assistants.
These ministries have organisational arrangements for monitoring and managing their institutions.
Thus agricultural training has been the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture since it was established in 1881.
In terms of the number of pupils, apprentices, students and those on placements in continuing training, it represents the second largest educational sector in France. See: http://www.educagri.fr/L_Enseignement_Agricole_Public.3.0.html

A number of bodies in the Netherlands play an important and influential part in the policy process, and consequently have an influence on higher education.
These bodies include the Raad van State, which advises the government and parliament on legislation and governance and is the country’s highest administrative court.
No regulation or law can pass without a judgement from the Raad van State. The Interdepartmentale Commissie voor Economische Structuurversterking makes recommendations to Cabinet on financial and economic issues.
A number of professional bodies in the medical or paramedical field play an advisory role to the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit und Frauen (Federal Ministry for Health and Women) in advanced training and admission to professions in this sector: n u ll

As a result, bodies responsible for management/supervision operate at two levels, central and institutional.
Trade unions have been included because of their important role in the process of preparing new legislation. The three most important trade unions active in the area of higher education have been selected.

Romanian higher education is based on the broad autonomy granted to higher education institutions.
Bodies operating at central level are mainly involved in evaluation, accreditation, financing and quality assurance of higher education.
At institutional level, bodies are involved in the educational and administrative management of higher education institutions and their departments.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs: cooperation with other states and international organisations Ministry of Health: postgraduate medical studies, clinical activities
There are two types of education at tertiary level (ISCED levels 5 and 6) in Slovenia: višje strokovno izobraževanje (higher vocational colleges at ISCED 5B) and visokošolsko izobraževanje (higher education institutions at ISCED 5 and ISCED 6).
Higher vocational colleges (public and private) are regulated by special law (Zakon o višjem strokovnem izobraževanju, the Tertiary Vocational Education Act) and a general act (Zakon o organizaciji in financiranju vzgoje in izobraževanja, the Organisation and Financing of Education Act), which also applies to pre-school, basic and secondary education, and are under jurisdiction of the Ministrstvo za šolstvo in šport (Ministry of Education and Sport). Higher education institutions (public and private) are autonomous, regulated by special legislation (Zakon o visokem šolstvu, the Higher Education Act) and the responsible ministry is the Ministrstvo za visoko šolstvo, znanost in tehnologijo (Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology).

According to the Universities Act (645/1997), the universities have autonomy in research, the arts and teaching. Only the main administrative structure is stipulated by the Act and the universities have their own complementary rules of procedure.
This means that they may have different names for similar bodies, and the responsibilities and structures may differ slightly.

The UK Government has devolved some of its powers, including responsibility for education, to the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Higher education institutions (HEIs) are, however, neither owned nor run by government, but are selfgoverning private sector institutions, and largely self-regulating.
Institutions with degree awarding powers decide the degrees they offer and the conditions on which they are awarded.
In institutions without degree awarding powers, qualifications are validated by a university or national accrediting body.
Since the abolition of the‘binary divide’between universities and polytechnics/colleges HEIs have constituted a single higher education sector, although they remain very diverse in terms of their constitutional arrangements, size, mission, subject mix and history.
In England, Scotland and Wales, higher education institutions are funded centrally by intermediary bodies, at arms’ length from government.
Many of the organisations included here have been set up by the sector itself and have a remit extending over the whole of the UK, although sometimes with autonomous or semiautonomous regional governing bodies.

The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture is responsible for all Higher Education Institutions except the Universities of agriculture, which comes under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture.

Because of the limited provision of higher education within the country (only the Hochschule Liechtenstein offers Bachelor and Master studies, while the University of Human Sciences and the International Academy of Philosophy offer doctoral studies), Liechtenstein is in a special position as over 90 % of its students study abroad, mainly in surrounding countries like Switzerland, Austria or Germany.

What does the future hold for the European Economic and Social Committee?
The Nice Treaty defines the Committee as the institutional bodyresponsible for representing civil society organisations.
– presentation of investigative reports on topics chosen in close cooperation withthe interest groups concerned;
– preparation of opinions on the Commission’s annual or half-yearly reports on thesingle market economic reform (Cardiff process); and
– identification of obstacles to achieving the single market, and identification andcirculation of best practices and information designed to encourage partnerships.
What are the EESC’s current priority objectives?
It is therefore entirely logical that the EESC should continue to assertitself as a committed interlocutor in the debate on the future of Europe. Through its three observers, it participates actively in thework of the European Convention, which is responsible for defining a new institutional set-up for the Union.
The EESCin ten points
Everything would seem to suggest, therefore, that, followingenlargement, the EESC will continue to represent the various economic and social components of organised civil society and topursue its fundamental role as a bridge between Europe and civilsociety.
Over and above its consultative role, the Committee is working to set up a model ofparticipatory democracy throughout Europe and the rest of the world.
It contributesto the development of socioeconomic organisations in civil society, including incountries applying to join the EU.
Through the Convention, it fully participates in thedebate on the future of Europe and preparations for the next IGC.
It has the sameobjectives as all the institutions that are working towards European integration, i.e.harmonious and balanced development, and the promotion of a social model thatplaces human values at the centre of such development.
The Committee’s work programme is based on the European Commission’s work programme, the priorities ofeach Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the work programme presented by each Committee president upon election.
What are the links between the European Economic and Social Committee and the national economic and social councilsandother similar bodies?
European Economic and Social Committee
The EESC has developed close cooperation with economic and social councils andsimilar institutions.
In the EU’s Member States, this cooperation is based on regularmeetings on specific subjects, the exchange of information and the development ofa joint web site (http://www.esc.eu.int/CESlink/en/ceslink_e.htm).
It also participates actively in the work of the International Association of Economicand Social Councils and Similar Institutions (IAESCSI), the members of which span50 countries.
Lastly, the EESC maintains regular relations with civil society organisations in the countries applying for EU membership and in several countries or country groupings outside the European Union.
These activities are carried out jointly with the economicand social councils in the Member States comprising such organisations.
The EESC in ten points
What is the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)?
How are EESC members appointed?
What added value does the EESC bring?
The EESC’s contribution to European integration is threefold:
EESC members are appointed by the Council of Ministers of the European Union forfour years on the basis of proposals put forward by the Member States in agreementwith representative civil society organisations at national level. Their mandate isrenewable.
The European Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body set up by the Rome Treaties in 1957.
It consists of representatives of the various economic andsocial components of organised civil society. Its main task is to advise the threemajor institutions (European Parliament, Council of the European Union and European Commission).
– firstly, members bring together considerable expertise under one roof.
These menand women work actively ‘in the field’ in the economic and social life of their country.
This pool of expertise is backed up by specific working methods, such as theuse of study groups, experts and hearings;
Members generally continue to carry out their professional activities in their country of origin and only travel to Brussels when required to do so for their EESC work.They are not paid for their EESC activities, but they do receive travel and meetingsallowances, the level of which is set by the Council.
– secondly, the Committee is a place for studying issues and hammering out solutions based on compromise, even where the initial stances are divergent or evendiametrically opposite;
How does the EESC operate?
It is mandatory for the Committee to be consulted on those issues stipulated in the Treaties and in all cases where the institutions deem it appropriate. It can also beconsulted on an exploratory basis by one of the other institutions, or can itself takethe initiative to issue opinions (around 15 % of its opinions are own-initiative opinions).
The Committee adopts on average 150 opinions a year on a wide range of subjects concerning European integration.
It therefore plays an active role in the Community decisionmaking process.
– finally, its members’ professional origins mean that the Committee is a focal pointfor the questions and aspirations of civil society organisations regarding all aspectsof European integration.
The Committee comprises six specialist sections covering a very wide range of Community spheres of responsibility:
The EESC also has two complementary tasks:– involving civil society organisations more in the European venture, and
In what way does the EESC provide a ‘bridge’ between Europeandcivil society?
EESC members directly represent the many different interests of civil society organisations in the EU. They bring to bear the expertise for which they were appointed.
– economic and monetary union and economic and social cohesion (ECO);– the single market, production and consumption (INT);– transport, energy, infrastructure and the information society (TEN);– employment, social affairs and citizenship (SOC);– agriculture, rural development and the environment (NAT);– external relations (REX).
– boosting the role of civil society organisations in non-member countries or groupsof countries, such as the countries applying for EU membership, with which veryactive Consultative Committees have been set up; the Euromed countries bordering the Mediterranean; African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries; Mersocur countries (Latin America); and India, amongst others.
The Committee holds structureddialogue with representatives of civil society organisations in these countries andregions, and promotes the creation of consultative structures based on its own model.
Whether it be the major EU enlargement scheduled for 2004 or the Conventionresponsible for proposing a reform of the European institutions, the EESC acts as ahost organisation for various participatory democracy forums, and guarantees apluralist model that enhances the legitimacy of the decisionmaking process.
Thanks to the EESC, building Europe is therefore the task not only of the European Union and politicians, but also of members of the public belonging to organisationsinvolved in economic, social and cultural life.
Through the role assigned to it by the Treaties, and thanks to its broad membershipand their expertise, the EESC constitutes a valuable forum for representing andinforming civil society organisations and expressing their views.
It speaks on behalfof these organisations to the European institutions and in doing so acts as a uniquebridge between Europe and its people.
In addition, following expiry of the ECSC Treaty in July 2002 and on a proposal bythe European Commission, the Committee was asked to assume the responsibilitiesof the ECSC’s Consultative Committee.
To this end, the EESC set up a Consultative Commission on Industrial Change (CCIC) composed of EESC members and, initially,delegates representing the coal and steel sectors.
This composition will be gradually extended to include other sectors affected by problems caused by the modernisation of the economy, and to all the interested parties concerned.
Hence the CCIC’sremit is not limited to the coal and steel sectors alone, but also takes account of allaspects of industrial change.
What is the impact of the EESC’s work?
Two thirds of EESC recommendations are taken into account by the decisionmaking bodies and their influence often goes beyond the limited scope of the Commission proposal being examined in a Committee opinion.
Committee opinions are prepared by ‘rapporteurs’, usually assisted by a study group,the members of which are selected from the three different groups on the basis oftheir expertise in a particular subject area and the need to ensure a certain geographical balance.
The size of these study groups varies from 3 to 15 members, depending on the importance of the subject. Rapporteurs can also call on external expertsto assist them.
The Committee’s membership is not static. It changes with each four-yearly renewalso as to reflect changes in civil society in the Member States as accurately as possible.
The EESC’s own-initiative opinions are of particular interest, as they often raise theawareness of decisionmaking bodies, and the Commission, especially, about subjects which have not hitherto attracted much, if any, of their attention.
Where particularly important issues are concerned, the Committee may hold publichearings in order to hear the views of a wide range of parties concerned.
The last EESC renewal – which covers the next four-year period – took place in October 2002.
A total of 40 % of members were newly appointed.
Until September 2004, the Committee presidency will be held by Mr Roger Briesch(Employees’ group, France), assisted by two vice-presidents, Mr Göke Frerichs(Employers’ group, Germany) and Mr Leif Nielsen (Various Interests group, Denmark).
One particularly interesting example of the impact of EESC work relates to the activities of the Single Market Observatory (SMO), which was set up by the EESC in 1994in order regularly to assess the actual progress achieved in bringing about the single market and, if necessary, propose improvements. The activities of this Observatory cover four main areas:
The Committee Secretariat will be headed by Mr Patrick Venturini, Secretary-General.

A partner for small and large corporates, banks and public authorities in Turkey
As a public institution with a development remit, the EIB has been financing projects in Turkey since 1965.
During more than 40 years’experience in Turkey, the EIB has invested in the order of EUR 15bn throughout all key sectors of the country’s economy.
rate investments, including foreign direct investment, R & D and innovation; and (iii) support for small and mediumsized enterprises across the country.
An important share of EIB lending is directed to municipalities to provide towns and cities with the longer-term finance needed to invest in infrastructure in order to comply with EU and national regulations and underpin economic growth.
Turkey’s progress in these different sectors of its economy will be essential to further strengthening its position within a competitive market like the EU.
The process of Turkey’s accession to the European Union offers enormous opportunities for both sides and the EIB’s role is to provide strong support to the EU’s strategy by financing concrete and viable projects in a wide range of sectors to bolster the country’s economic development and social cohesion.
As Turkey is a Candidate Country, the Bank’s financing is no longer governed by EU mandates only.
The EIB is using a variety of investment tools to help the country to progress on the road towards the EU, having stepped up considerably its lending volume and the range of sectors covered.
The main pillars of the EIB’s activities include (i) infrastructure investments in transport, energy and the environment; (ii) corpo-

•Work in partnership with local banks and national financing institutions to increase the amount and diversity of financing and improve the country’s investment climate by offering appropriate forms of finance to project promoters.
Projects can involve co-financing with EU funds and international finance institutions mobilising technical assistance and grant funds.
Finance for investment projects
Types of support available ever, the long tenors provided by the EIB and favourable interest rates improve the conditions offered to the project promoters.
Through its intermediated lending, the Bank seeks to combine its own financial strength with the local or regional market knowledge and client network of its partner institutions.
The EIB typically finances up to 50% of project costs.
EIB loans are intended to supplement an investor’s own funds and finance from other sources.
The Bank seeks to offer a financial package that is suitable for the project and its promoter together with other financing institutions or commercial banks.

The EIBfinancesinvestment either through individual loans, framework loans or EIB loans for SMEs.
Large-scale projects are financed through individual loans concluded by the EIB on its own terms and conditions directly with the investor or with other banks and institutions.
The EIB appraises each project to determine its economic, financial and technical feasibility, the financial standing of the project promoter and whether the security provided is adequate.
Each project appraisal includes an assessment of possible effects on the environment and compliance with national, European or international environmental standards, as applicable.
Small and mediumsized investment projects are financed indirectly through framework loans, EIB loans for SMEs and midcap loans, which are credit lines extended by the Bank to financing institutions or commercial banks.
The partner institutions use agreed global credit facilities to finance investment by small and mediumsized enterprises or infrastructure projects undertaken by local or regional authorities.
The EIB agrees with the intermediary bank what type of investment may be financed under the credit facility and the nature of the eligible promoter.
Partner institutions finance the projects and grant loans on their own account, at their own risk and on their own terms and conditions. How-

The European Investment Fund
About the EIF
(TTGV), the Development Bank of Turkey (TKB), Garanti Bank, National Bank of Greece and EIF.
EIF established an iVCi Strategic Network meetings platform in 2009. These meetings give representatives of venture capital funds, entrepreneurs, business angel networks and technology companies the opportunity to share views on the venture capital market in Turkey and explore ways to develop the market.
The main objective of iVCi is to act as a catalyst for the development of venture capital in Turkey whilst serving as a platform for the first wave of Turkish institutional investors.
Through iVCi, EIF also undertakes an active effort of information dissemination about the asset class.
As a European Union institution with a specialised focus on SME financing, the European Investment Fund plays a crucial role throughout the value chain of enterprise creation, from the earliest stages of intellectual property development to mid and later-stage.
By offering SME in the EU-27 a wide range of financing solutions and enhancing their access to finance, the EIF supports EU objectives such as innovation, research, regional development, entrepreneurship, growth and job creation.
The three main pillars of the EIF’s business are venture capital, guarantees and microfinance.
The EIF ownership structure comprises the EIB as lead shareholder (61%), alongside the European Commission (30%) and 30 public and private financial institutions (9%).
The Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) has been a shareholder of EIF since September 2006.
On the Credit Guarantee front, in 2010 alone EIF signed three agreements under the European Commission’s Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP): • The first two with Finansbank for a total of TRY 255m (c.
EUR 122m) providing SMEs access to over TRY 430m (c. EUR 206m) ofloans guaranteed under the CIP which will help to support existing and new Turkish entrepreneurs and create new jobs. • The third one, a EUR 45m guarantee agreement with Kredi Garanti Fonu (KGF), has led to the launch of a new initiative by KGF titled‘One SME for every village’ which aims at working with at least one business in each of the 3 000 villages targeted across Turkey, including those where access to finance is more challenging • This, added to the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF) signed in 2004, brings the overall total guarantees committed to close to EUR 190m.
Over the past three years the EIF has actively participated in the development of the venture capital industry in Turkey.
It has done so by investing EUR 54m in two leading independently managed funds, Actera Partners and Turkish Private Equity Fund II, and by implementing the Istanbul Venture Capital initiative (iVCi), a programme tailor-made for Turkey’s specific needs.
Istanbul Venture Capital Initiative - iVCi iVCi is a dedicated Turkish fund of funds and co-investment programmefully advised by EIF.
Final closing took place on 31 March 2009 at EUR 160m.
The investors in iVCi are the SME Development Association of Turkey (KOSGEB), the Technology Development Foundation of Turkey
•Eurasia Capital for EUR 15m Eurasia Capital is a generalist lower mid market fund which will invest in Turkish SMEs with the potential to grow both organically and through acquisitions.
It is managed by a first-time team, Eurasia Capital Limited, a fund manager based in Istanbul.
In July 2010, the Greater Anatolia Guarantee Facility (GAGF) was launched.
This regional development initiative will target SMEs and micro-enterprises in the 43 provinces of the Anatolia region of Turkey.
It will provide a blend of funding and portfolio risk sharing at an EIB Group level with EUR 32m of Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) programme of the European Union funds managed by EIF, and EUR 250m of EIB lending which has to be matched by the same amount of loans by the intermediaries.

As external auditor the European Court of Auditors contributes to improving EU financial management and acts as the independent guardian of the financial interests of the citizens of the Union.
THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS the European Union’s external auditor
HOW DOES THE COURT AUDIT?
AUDITING THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC FUNDS budgets, partly due to differences in responsibilities.
The Union is for example not responsible for social security systems, usually a large part of national spending.
WHAT IS THE OUTPUT OF THE COURT’S AUDIT?
The Court publishes the results of its audit work in the following types of report:
The objectives of auditing are the proper and effective use of public funds, the development of sound financial management, the proper execution of administrative activities and the communication of information to public authorities and the general public through the publication of objective reports.
Existing international standards on audit do not however cover the kind of compliance audit undertaken by the Court.
The Court takes an active part, alongside national audit institutions, in the development of international standards by standard-setting bodies (INTOSAI, IFAC).
The largest single element of European Union spending is agriculture and rural development, accounting for almost half of the budget.
Another significant proportion is spending on cohesion – regional and social development.
This constitutes about a third of the budget.
> Annual reports - presenting the results of financial audits in the form of statements of assurance on the EU general budget and the The role of the auditor is to examine the acts of those responsible for management, with the aim of improving the results and accounting to the taxpayer for the managing authorities’ use of public funds.
The European Commission proposes the budget and is also responsible for implementing it.
A very significant proportion - notably agricultural and cohesion spending - is implemented in cooperation with the Member States.
The European Court of Auditors is the EU Institution established by treaty to carry out the audit of the EU’s finances.
As the EU’s external auditor, it contributes to improving the EU’s financial management and acts as the independent guardian of the financial interests of the citizens of the Union.
In order to provide assurance as to whether the payments comply with legal and regulatory frameworks, the Court draws on the results both of its examination of supervisory and control systems, intended to prevent or detect and correct errors of legality and regularity, and of a sample of the transactions (payments) themselves.
When systems are tested and found to be reliable, then fewer transactions need to be audited by the Court in order to come to a valid conclusion on their legality and regularity.
Other sources, such as the work of other auditors, are also used to support the Court’s conclusions.
Citizenship, freedom, security and justice
The Court carries out three different types of audit: financial, compliance and performance audit.

> Is the financial management sound, i.e. are the funds used kept to a minimum (economy), are the results achieved with the least possible
The results of the Court’s work are used by the Commission, the Parliament and the Council as well as by Member States, to improve the financial management of the EU budget.
The Court’s work provides an important basis for the annual discharge procedure whereby the Parliament, basing its decision on recommendations from the Council, decides whether the Commission has met its responsibility for the execution of the previous year’s budget.
Despite its name, the Court has no judicial powers.
AUDIT REPORTS AND OPINIONS ARE AVAILABLE IN ALL EU OFFICIAL LANGUAGES ON THE COURT’S WEBSITE
THE STAFFThe European Court of Auditors has a staff of around 880 comprising auditors, translators and administrative support.
The Court’s audit staff has a broad range of professional backgrounds and experience from both the public and private sectors, including accountancy, financial management, internal and external audit, law and economics.
Like all other EU institutions the Court employs nationals from all Member States.

STRUCTUREThe Court organises itself around five Chambers, to which Members are assigned.
There are four Chambers with responsibility for specific areas of expenditure and for revenue (vertical Chambers), and one horizontal Chamber, known as the CEAD (Coordination, Evaluation, Assurance and Development) Chamber.
The Members of each Chamber elect a Dean for a renewable term of two years.
Revenue, research and internal policies, and institutions and bodies of the European Union
THE COURT’S GOVERNANCE AND ORGANISATION
Each Chamber has two areas of responsibility – firstly, to adopt special reports, specific annual reports and opinions; secondly, to prepare draft observations for the annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Funds, and draft opinions for adoption by the Court as a whole.
THE MEMBERS OF THE COURTThe European Court of Auditors consists of one Member from each Member State of the European Union.
The European Court of Auditors seeks good contacts and working relations with similar organisations all over the world.
The full Court convenes to discuss and adopt the documents for which it is solely responsible, such as the annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Funds.
Coordination, evaluation, assurance and development
The Members of the Court are appointed by the Council, after consultation with the European Parliament, following nomination by their respective Member States.
Members are appointed for a renewable term of six years.
3 MEMBERS + ONE MEMBER REPRESENTING EACH VERTICAL CHAMBER
The Administrative Committee is made up of the Deans of the Chambers and is chaired by the President of the Court. The Committee prepares for approval by the Court all administrative matters requiring a Court decision and decisions on matters of policy, principle or strategic importance.
The objective of this cooperation is closely linked to the Court’s responsibility for the audit of EU funds.
As these funds generally pass through the national administrations of the countries concerned and the respective SAIs audit those administrations, close cooperation between the Court and national SAIs is essential for effective and efficient implementation of the Court’s tasks.
THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEANS OF THE CHAMBERS
THE PRESIDENTThe European Court of Auditors is headed by a President who is elected for a renewable term of three years by the Members from amongst their number.
His or her role is that of primus inter pares - first amongst equals.
He or she chairs the Court meetings, ensures that Court decisions are implemented and that the institution and its activities are soundly managed.
Cooperation between the Court and the SAIs of EU Member States principally takes place within the framework of the Contact Committee, made up of the Heads of the EU SAIs including the President of the European Court of Auditors.
The President represents the Court in its external relations, in particular with the discharge authority, the other EU institutions and the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member and beneficiary States.
International cooperation also provides valuable opportunities to exchange views and experiences on the use of international public sector auditing standards.

INDEPENDENT EU AUDIT INSTITUTION
An independent external audit function is essential for ensuring accountability for the use of public fundsin a moderndemocratic society.
The European Court of Auditors is the external audit institution of the European Union.
In contributing towardsimproving all aspects of the financial management of Union funds, the Court performs a vital role for the citizens of the Union.
Financial control over EU funds
The European Commission is responsible for the implementation of the budget of the European Union and for ensuringthat EU funds are spent wisely and in conformity with the relevant rules and regulations.
For most of EU expenditure, represented by agriculture and structural operations, the management and control of funds is undertaken incooperation with Member States.
Thus, the European Union expenditure is subject to many levels of control within the Commission and by Member and beneficiary State administrations.
In addition, the Commission has an internal auditfunction which helps ensure that adequate control systems are established and operate effectively.
The Court's role,as external auditor, is to assess the financial management of the budget as a whole.
Historical background nd
July 1975 and started operating in October 1977, with its headquarters in Luxembourg.
The Treaty of Maastrichtof 7 February 1992 made the European Court of Auditors an institution of the European Communities, enhancing its independence and authority.
It introduced the requirement for the Court to publish an annual Statement of Assurance (known as DAS, from the French term déclaration d'assurance) on the reliability of the Communities' accounts, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
The Treaty of Amsterdamof 2 October 1997 recognised the Court of Auditors as an institution of the European Unionand thus formally enlarged the Court's audit scope to include the second and third pillars of the Union (foreign andsecurity policy, and justice and home affairs). It emphasised the Court's role in respect of irregularities andmeasures to combat fraud.
The Treaty of Niceof 26 February 2001 provided that the Court of Auditors should be composed of one Member fromeach Member State.
It confirmed the practice of publishing specific DAS appraisals for eachmajor area of European Union activity. It also emphasised the importance of the cooperation between the Court and thesupreme audit institutions of the Member States.
The European Court of Auditors is theexternal auditor of the European Union finances.Articles 246 to 248 of the EC Treaty sets out the mandate and composition of the European Court of Auditors.The mandate is summarised as follows:
The European Court of Auditors audits the accounts of all the revenue and expenditure of the European Unionand, unless otherwise specified, all bodies established by the Union; examines whether all EU revenue and expenditure has been received or incurred in a lawful and regular mannerand whether the financial managementhas been soundie, with due regard for economy, efficiency and effectiveness; produces an Annual Reportcontaining its observations on the execution of the European Union budget for eachfinancial year, including a Statement of Assurance (DAS)on the reliability of the European Union accounts forthat year and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions; may submit observations on specific topics of its choice at any time, particularly in the form of Special Reports;reports on cases of irregularity or suspected frauddetected in the course of its audit work;provides formal opinionson proposals for EU legislation of a financial nature; is consulted on any proposals for measures in the fight against fraud; assists the discharge authority- the European Parliament - in exercising its powers of control over theimplementation of the budget of the European Union through the publication of audit reports and opinions.
The Court does not have judicial powersand thus neither its reports nor its opinions are legally binding.However, the Court's work is used to improve financial management by those responsible for legislating for,managing and administering EU programmes and finances.
ORGANISATION AND STRUCTURE
The EC Treaty stipulates that the European Court of Auditors consists of one Member from each Member State.The Members are appointed by the Council of the European Union, after consultation with the European Parliament,on the basis of nominations made by individual Member States.

Open competitions foremployment posts at the Court are organised by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
The Court provides traineeships to a limited number of university graduates for periods of three to five months.
Internal organisation
The Court of Auditors operates as a collegiate body,with its Members adopting audit reports and opinions by majorityvote.
Court meetings are not public.
The Court draws up its own rules of proceduregoverning its internal operation which are submitted to the Council of the EU for approval.
The Court is organised in audit groupscomprising a number of specialised divisions which cover the different areas ofthe budget.
The CEADaudit group (Coordination, Evaluation, Assurance and Development) is responsible for thecoordination of the Statement of Assurance, quality assurance and the development of the Court's audit methodology.
The Court assigns each Member to a group.
Each group is chaired by a “Dean”, elected by the Members of the groupfrom amongst their number for a renewable two-year term.
The Dean ensures the smooth running of the group and thedivisions under it, in agreement with the other Members of the group.
In addition, there is an Administrative Committee, composed of Members representing all audit groups, which isresponsible for the administrative matters requiring a formal decision by the Court.
Since 2004, documents may be adopted by the Court without discussion, on the basis of a decision by two thirds of the Members of an audit group or of the Administrative Committee.
There is an Internal Auditorappointed by the Court, who reports to an Audit Committee, comprising three Membersof the Court and an external expert.
The Court of Auditors is financed from the general budget of the European Union, which the European Parliament adoptsafter having consulted the Council.
In 2004 the Court's budget amounted to around 95million euro, representing some 0.1 % of the total expenditure ofthe European Union and 1.6 % of the total administrative expenditure of the EU institutions and bodies.
At its own initiative, the Court's financial statements are audited by an external audit firm.
The audit results arecommunicated to the European Parliament and the Council.
The financial statements and accompanying audit reportare published in the Official Journal and on the Court’s website.
As for the other EU institutions, the execution of the Court's budget is subject to a decision by the European Parliamentto grant discharge to the institution for its budgetary management each year.

The subjectsof audits vary considerably from financial statements to detailed examinations of specific budgetary areasor management topics.
Audit tasks are divided into: recurrentaudit tasks, which according to the Treaty, the Court is required to undertake each year.
These include the audit of the financial statements of the European Union, the European Development Funds and of allother bodies and agencies set up by the Union; and selectedaudit tasks, where the Court selects budgetary areas or management topics of specific interest fordetailed audit.
The European Court of Auditors organises and carries out its audit work independentlyof the other EU institutionsand national governments.
It has power of decision over its selected audits, including the topics, the audit approach tobe followed, and how and when to present its observations and publicise its findings.
In line with other public audit institutions, the Court does not audit every budgetary area in depth every year, but aselection of budgetary or management topics.
As a basis for identifying audit tasks, the Court regularly undertakes a riskanalysisof the entire audit field, taking into account issues such as known problems or weaknesses, financial significanceand the findings of previous audits.
The potential tasks are ranked by priority on the basis of both the results of the risk analysisand the need to ensure a balanced coverage of budgetary areas.
Other factors considered when making the final selectionof audit tasks include the specific concerns of the European Parliament, the Council and the public at large.
The Court carries out its audits in accordance with its own audit policies and standards, which adapt generallyaccepted international standards to the European Union context.
In particular, they are based on INTOSAIAuditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Federation of Accountants.
The Treaty gives the Court a right of accessto any information it requires to undertake its tasks.
The Court's audits canbe performed on-the-spot in the European Union institutions, at the premises of the bodies or legal persons that managefunds on behalf of the Union and in the Member and beneficiary States, including all levels of administration throughto the final recipient of the EU funds.
Adding value to financial management
Thisincludes making suggestions on how to cost-effectively: improve compliance with legislation; reduce the risk of errors and irregularities; improve the organisation of European Union activities and its internal control systems;make the European Union’s actions more transparent by improving accounting methods and procedures; andachieve EU policy objectives more effectively and efficiently.
Irregularities and fraud
The European Court of Auditors reports on any irregularities and suspectedfraud.
The primary responsibility for the prevention, detection and investigation of errors and irregularities rests withthose responsible for the management and execution of EU programmes ie, the European Commission and the Member States.
The Court assesses how well the Commission and the Member States fulfil their responsibilitiesin this field and identifies how improvements could be made.
When a case of suspected fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity becomes known to the Court, eitherthrough its audit work or when the case is reported by a member of the public, the matter is immediately communicated to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
OLAF is responsible for undertaking detailed investigations and instigating prosecutions in Member and beneficiary States, and following up the resultingrecovery of EU funds.
The Treaty also requires that the Court of Auditors be requested to give a formal opinionon each proposal tointroduce or amend legislation with a financial impact, including the fight against fraud.
Other European Unioninstitutions may also request the Court to give its formal opinion on specific matters.
AUDIT APPROACH
In line with other public audit institutions, the European Court of Auditors undertakes two different types of audit,namely financial auditand sound financial management audit.
Reliability of the accounts:Are the financial statements complete and accurate?
According to the Treaties and the Financial Regulation, it is the duty of the Court of Auditors to audit the financial statements on the revenue and expenditure relative to the general budget of the European Union, the European Development Funds and all bodies and agencies set up by the Union.
In general, these comprise a balance sheet, aneconomic outturn account, a cash-flow table, a statement of changes in capital and explanatory notes.
The objectiveis to establish whether the financial statements show a true and fair viewof the results for the yearand the financial situation at the year end: that transactions, assets and liabilities have been fully and correctly enteredinto the accounting records; that they exist; that they belong to the audited body; and that they are correctlypresented in the financial statements.
Legality and regularity:Has the income been collected and expenditure incurred in conformity with all relevantrules and regulations?
The Treaties and the Financial Regulation require the Court to audit the legality and regularity of the transactions bywhich the EU finances and implements its budget.
The objectiveis to ensure that transactions have been executed in accordance with the relevantrules andregulations, that they exist in reality, have been correctly calculated and that the beneficiaries of EU aid havefulfilled their obligations.
The audit covers all aspects from receipt or payment by the Commission throughdifferent levels of administration down to individual elements of EU revenue or receipt by the final beneficiary.
Statement of Assurance (DAS)
Since 1994 the Court has been required by the Treaty to provide a Statement of Assurance(DAS - déclaration d'assurance), comprising an opinion on the reliabilityof the European Union’s financial statements and an opinion on thelegality and regularityof the transactions underlying them.
The DAS is based on the results of detailed financialaudits.
The main objectivesof the DAS are to inform the discharge authority whether:the consolidated financial statements of the general budget of the European Union, drawn up by the European Commission, present a true and fairviewof the financial activities for the year and of the year-end situation; and legal and contractual provisions have been respected when executing the budget.
The Court's overall DAS opinion is based on specific appraisals for each major area of European Union activity whichprovide detailed information on sources of error, weaknesses and how management could be improved.
The specific appraisals are based on the following:
Assessment of the functioning of the internal control systems (particularly the supervisory systems) both at the Commission and in Member and beneficiary States;Audit evidencebased on the testing of a sample of transactions from each budgetary field;Evidence arising from the audits of EU finances carried out by other auditors; and Examination of the annual activity reports and declarationsissued by the Directors-General of the European Commission.
The DAS specific appraisals include monitoring elementsin order to provide an objective assessment of the quality offinancial management and to allow the monitoring of progress over time.
The DAS statement, with accompanying information, is published in the Court's Annual Report, which the Courtdelivers to the European Parliament and Council.
The statement is also published with the financial statements of the European Union in the Official Journal.
In addition to its opinion on the implementation of the general budget, the Court also provides an annual Statement of Assurance on the reliability of the accounts of the European Development Fundsand the legality and regularity of thetransactions underlying them.
Similar opinions are provided on the financial statements of the European Union's agencies and bodies.
Sound financial management audit
Value for money:Have the funds been managed in an economic, efficient and effective manner, providingvalue for money for the citizens of the Union?
The objectiveis to evaluate how well the Commission and the Member States have applied the principles of soundfinancial management - economy, efficiency and effectiveness - to their management of European Union funds.Such audits are also known as performance audits and value for money audits.
According to the Financial Regulation, EU funds should be managed based on the principles of: economy
For a given output or objective, the minimum amount of funds have been used.
Best value has been obtained for the money spent.
The objectives of the EU policy have been met.
The Court, in common with other public audit bodies, has two different approaches to sound financial managementaudits, depending on the topic under audit and the risks involved.
The first approach is to evaluate the management of the expenditure, and particularly the measures taken to achievevalue for money.
This involves making an evaluation of the approach taken by management and the systems usedfor ensuring value for money and testing the decisions taken.
The audit concludes on whether the approach takenby management was likely to ensure value for money, and if not, how it could be improved.
The second approach comprises an assessment of whether a given programme or project met its objectives and achievedvalue for money.
This involves an examination of whether, and how, the objectives of the specific expenditure wereachievedand an assessment of whether the minimum resources were used for that outcome.
The audit concludes onwhether value for money was achieved for the programme, and if not, how it could be improved.
GENERAL AUDIT OBJECTIVES

Legality and regularity a transaction conforms to the applicable laws and regulations and is covered by sufficient budgetary appropriations
Completeness all transactions proper to the period are entered into the accounting records
Reality of operations the transaction is justified by an event which pertains to the body and is proper to the period
Financial audit - legality and regularity of transactions
Measurement the amount at which the transaction is recorded is correctly established and entered in the accounting records
Presentation and publication the transaction is disclosed, classified and described in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework
Economy the resources are made available at the appropriatetime, are sufficient in quantity, are adequate in quality and are obtained for the lowest possible cost
Sound financial management audit
Efficiency the resources used to meet the objectives of the action provide an optimal ratio between inputs and outputs
Effectiveness the extent to which objectives are achieved and the relationship between intended and actual impact
Each audit is carried out in three main stages: planning; testing; and reporting.
The Court undertakes the planning of its work programme on a multiannual and annual basis.
The multiannual plan allows the Court's strategy to be defined and updated, and the annualplan sets out the specific tasks to be undertakenduring the year in question.
In the case of selected audits the work starts with a preliminary studyto assess whether a detailed audit of thespecific task would be worthwhile ie, whether the audit is likely to have an impact and to be cost-effective.
Duringthis stage the auditors collect and analyse data from the European Commission and Member and beneficiary State administrations in order to prepare an overview of the main management and internal control systems.
The auditorsmake a detailed evaluation of the risks involved and identify sources of potential audit evidence.
This informationhelps the auditors define the general and detailed audit objectives and the type and extent of detailed testingneeded to meet them.
Audit objectives are a precise statement of what the audit intends to accomplish and/or thequestions the audit will answer.
The preliminary study report concludes with an assessment of the expected impactof a detailed audit and its overall cost.
For every audit undertaken, the auditors prepare an audit planning memorandum which sets out the audit scope,approach and objectives, and how these are to be achieved in the most efficient and cost-effective way.
It includes detailsof the human and other resources needed to complete the task and practical information such as countries to be visitedand how audit evidence is to be collected, as well as the audit timetable.
The planning memorandum is complementedby an audit programmewhich sets out the audit testing needed in detail.
The audit planning memoranda and audit programmes are submitted for approvalto the audit group responsible.
The purpose of audit testing is to obtain sufficient, relevant and reliable audit evidence to allow the auditors toreach conclusions on the audit objectives.
Audit testingis undertaken by audit teams of two or three staff.
The auditors collect evidence in accordance withthe audit programme, both within the European Union institutions and on-the-spot in Member and beneficiary States.
Depending on the type of audit, this usually involves the examination and testing of systems and transactionsat all relevant administrative levels.
Statistical samplingtechniques are often used as an efficient way of obtaininga representative view of a population of transactions.
For some audits the Court uses external expertstoprovide specific specialist knowledge.
Audit evidenceis obtained by the auditor in a number of ways, generally involving examinationof keysupporting documentation, physical inspectionand enquiry.
The type of evidence needed depends on the transactionor audit subject in question and, in particular, on the conditions for receiving the EU aid.
For example an auditof the suckler cow premium paid to farmers will require the auditor to obtain proof that the livestock existed,met the specific eligibility criteria such as age and that it was held by the farmer during the eligibility period.EU aid paid for regional infrastructure projects requires proof of the physical existence of the project as well asthe reality and eligibility of the costs incurred by the beneficiary and claimed for reimbursement.
Systems based audit approach
Audits generally involve the direct testing of a sample of transactions in order to obtain the necessary supporting evidence.
However, the extent of this testing can be reduced when reliance is placed on the internal control systems,where it is possible and economic to do so.
The systems based approachstarts with a detailed examination andtesting of the design and functioning of the audited body's internal control systems, to obtain evidence of their effectiveness.
Internal control systemsare the systems put in place by management to ensure: the achievement of the body's objectives in an economic, efficient and effective manner; adherence to external rules (laws, regulations) and management policies; the safeguarding of assets and information; the prevention and detection of fraud and error; and the appropriate quality of accounting records and the timely production of reliable financial and management information.
If the audit testing shows that the systems are well conceived and operating effectively, the amount of direct testingof transactions necessary to meet the audit objectives can be reduced.
The systems based approach is used for both financial and sound financial management audits and has the advantageof providing detailed observations on the internal control systems allowing systematic weaknesses to be identified andsuggestions made for improvement.
After the completion of the audit work, the audit team drafts an official letter setting out the detailed findings.This statement of preliminary findings is signed by the Court Member responsible for the audit task concerned andis addressed to the auditees, either: the Member State authorities responsible for the management of the EU funds in the case of sharedmanagement expenditure; the European Commissionin the case of directly managed expenditure; or the other EU institutionsin the case of audit of their own expenditure.
The purpose of the statement is to allow the auditees to confirm the factual accuracy of the Court's audit findingsand to give them the opportunity to provide any further information or explanations that may be necessary.
Once the auditors have obtained sufficient, relevant and reliable audit evidence, the information is analysed and used asa basis to arrive at conclusionson each of the audit objectives.
The purpose of audit reports is to communicate the results of the Court's work to the auditee, the discharge authorityand the general public.
The publication of audit reports is an important element for ensuring transparency within theprocess of oversight over the management and use of EU funds.
Once the programmed audit work has been completed and the audit evidence analysed, the auditors draw up a draft auditreport ("The Court's preliminary observations") containing: the audit observations and findings; conclusions on the audit objectives; and recommendations for improvement.
The draft audit report is examined first by the audit group and then submitted for approval by the Court.
The draft report is sent to the auditee - the European Commission or other European Union institution concerned - in thecontext of a bilateral discussion procedure, during which the auditee checks the facts presented and makes an officialreply to the Court's observations.
This reply takes into account the reactions of the Member States.
Depending on thereply, the Court either maintains its original observations or modifies them to correct any errors or misunderstandings.
The auditee's reply is published with the audit report.
At the conclusion of the bilateral discussion procedure, the Courtformally adopts the definitive audit report.

The Court's audit reports and opinions are formally communicated to the Presidents of the EU institutions and to the Chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control.
In addition, the Annual Report is sent to the Budget Committee of the Council as well as to the national Parliaments and the Heads of the supreme audit institutionsof the Member States.
The audit reports and accompanying press releases are also communicated to the international press and otherinterested parties upon publication.
Presentation to the European Parliament and Council
The President of the Court presents the Annual Report to the European Parliament at a plenary session, after havingpresented it to the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The President of the Court also presents thereport to the ECOFIN Council, which consists of the Economic and Finance Ministers of the Member States.
Special Reports, like the Specific Annual Reportsare, as a rule, presented to the European Parliament's Committeeon Budgetary Control by the Member of the Court responsible.
In addition, other specialised Committees of the European Parliament and the Council examine or take into account the Court's reports.
The European Parliament adopts resolutions on the Court's audit observations and the Council makes recommendationsfor corrective actionto be taken by the Commission or other EU institution, on the basis of the Court's audit findings.
The European Court of Auditors’ reports for a given year are the starting point for the annual discharge procedure.This completes the cycle of accountability over the use of European Union funds which started a number of yearsearlier with the initial approval of the budget by the Parliament and Council.
The discharge authority- the European Parliament - examines the annual accounts of the general budget preparedby the European Commission.
The Parliament, following a proposal by its Committee on Budgetary Control and arecommendation from the Council, decides whether to discharge the Commission and the other institutions for theexecution of the budget for the financial year in question.
The granting of discharge indicates acceptance that the Commission's or other EU institutions' management of the European Union funds has been sound, its expenditure legal and regular, its financial management effective, and thatits use of appropriations has furthered the EU policy objectives as intended.
Failure to give discharge is one of thestrongest rebukes that the European Parliament can make towards the Commission or the other EU institutions.The Parliament may also postpone discharge until the Commission or other EU institution has taken remedial actionon key weaknessess.
Each year the Commission is required to report to the discharge authority on the actions taken on the basis of theprevious discharge decisions.
Follow-up of previous audit observations
A few years after a Court audit has been completed, a follow-up on the audit results is undertaken.
The purpose is toestablish what corrective action has been taken on the basis of the recommendations from the Court and the discharge authority.
The results of the follow-up work are reported in the Court's Annual Report and, thereby, communicated to thedischarge authority.
COOPERATION WITH NATIONAL SUPREME AUDIT INSTITUTIONS
The Treaty states that the European Court of Auditors and the supreme audit institutions(SAIs) of the Member Statesare to cooperate in a spirit of trust while maintaining their respective independence.
Furthermore, the Treaty requires the Court's audit visits in the Member States to be carried out in liaisonwith thenational supreme audit institutions or other competent national audit bodies.
In practice, the national supreme auditinstitution provides the Court's auditors with local practical and logistic support as well as specific knowledge of theaudited field.
The Court's annual work programme is communicated to the SAIs as well as to the European Commission,the European Parliament and the Council.
The SAIs and the Commission are kept informed of the Court's on-the-spotaudit visitsin the Member States.
Since 1978 the Presidents of the supreme audit institutions of the Member States and the European Court of Auditorshave met within an annual Contact Committeemeeting.
These meetings provide the opportunity to discuss matters ofcommon interest and facilitate exchanges of information and practical cooperation, whilst respecting the independenceand constitutional mandates of each institution.
Since 1996 the European Court of Auditors has organised regular formalmeetings with the Heads of the supreme audit institutions of the candidate countries for enlargement.
The aim of thiscooperation is to develop and harmonise audit approaches and methods with a view to the efficient and effective management and control of European Union funds.
The liaison officersof the European SAIs and the European Court of Auditors meet twice a year in order to preparethe meetings of the Contact Committee and to provide an active network of professional contacts around Europe.The Contact Committee sets up working groupson general and specific issues of common interest.
The European Court of Auditors participates in activities organised by EUROSAI, the European umbrella organisationfor the Supreme Audit Institutions, and INTOSAI, the worldwide organisation.
In order for the European Union to be truly legitimate in the eyes of itscitizens, its many policiesneed to be implemented effectivelyand its budgetadministered efficiently.
In practice, responsibility for the managementof EUprogrammes lies both with the European Commission and, for over 80% of EUexpenditure, themultiple administrative layers in Member and beneficiary States.
As such, the day-to-day administration, management and control of EUfundsis undertaken increasingly at national and regional level, thus providing quicker and moretransparent decision-making closer to the citizen.
Political scrutinyof the management of the European Union occurs at many levels both by the European Parliament and Council, and by national parliaments.
In addition, the mediapays close attention to the use of EU monies and isparticularly interested in reporting on cases of fraud or misuse.
In this context, the European Court of Auditors has a vital role to play asthe external auditor of the European Union:
By publishing its reports, the Court helps promote transparency and accountability in the management of European Union funds;
Through its audit work, the Court helps ensure that EU funds are collected and used in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations;
The Court's audit observations and recommendations help managers of EU funds improve their performanceand contribute towards improvingsound financial management; and of the
The Court's audit reports serve as a basis for the democratic scrutiny utilisation of EU funds by the European Parliament and the Council.

Foreword by the European Ombudsman
Forewordby the European Ombudsman
Dear reader,
Since taking up the post of European Ombudsman on 1 April 2003, I have worked hard to promote good administration within the European Unions institutions and bodies. is work has a dual dimension.
On the one hand, the Ombudsman acts as an external mechanism of control, investigating complaints about maladministration and recommending corrective action where necessary.
On the other hand, the Ombudsman serves as a resource to the institutions, helping them to better their performance by directing attention to areas for improvement. e ultimate goal in both instances is to improve the service provided to European citizens.
e European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour is a vital tool for the Ombudsman in performing his dual role. e Ombudsman uses the Code in examining whether there is maladministration, thereby relying on its provisions for his control function.
But equally the Code serves as a useful guide and a resource for civil servants, encouraging the highest standards of administration.
With the Charter making up Part II of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, we can be sure that this right will become increasingly meaningful in the coming years.
Citizens and officials have shown much interest in the Code since its adoption by the European Parliament in September 2001.
Its impact has not been limited to the Unions institutions and bodies and I am pleased to note that the Code has been taken on board by a number of Member States and candidate countries.
As European Ombudsman, I feel it is my duty to further raise awareness of the rights and obligations contained therein.
It is for this reason that we have chosen to publish a new version in all of the official EU languages, as well as in the languages of the candidate countries.
I hope that the Code will continue to serve as a useful working tool for public administrations and as a reference point for citizens all over Europe.
Strasbourg, 5 January 2005.
On 6 September 2001, the European Parliament adopted a resolution approving a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour which European Union institutions and bodies, their administrations and their officials should respect in their relations with the public.
e idea of a Code was rst proposed by Roy PERRY MEP in 1998. e European Ombudsman dra ed the text, following an own-initiative inquiry and presented it to the European Parliament as a special report. e Parliaments resolution on the Code is based on the Ombudsmans proposal, with some changes introduced by Mr PERRY as rapporteur for the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament.
e Code takes account of the principles of European administrative law contained in the case law of the Court of Justice and also draws inspiration from national laws.
The Status of the Code e Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was proclaimed at the Nice summit in December 2000 and has now become Part II of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
The European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour e Charter includes as fundamental rights of Union citizenship the right to good administration (art.
41) and the right to complain to the European Ombudsman against maladministration by the Unions institutions and bodies (art. 43).
is Code is intended to explain in more detail what the Charters right to good administration should mean in practice.
Right to good administration
(Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
1 Every person has the right to have his or her a airs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union.
2 This right includes:
– the right of every person to be heard, before any individual measure which would a ect him or her adversely is taken;
– the right of every person to have access to his or her le, while respecting the legitimate interests of confidentiality and of professional and business secrecy;
– the obligation of the administration to give reasons for its decisions.
3 Every person has the right to have the Community make good any damage caused by its institutions or by its servants in the performance of their duties, in accordance with the general principles common to the laws of the Member States.
4 Every person may write to the institutions of the Union in one of the languages of the Treaties and must have an answer in the same language.
x e European Ombudsman investigates possible cases of maladministration in the activities of Union institutions and bodies, in accordance with Article 195 of the EC Treaty and the Statute of the Ombudsman2. e Ombudsmans definition of maladministration in his 1997 Annual Report is that
“maladministration occurs when a public body fails to act in accordance with a rule or principle which is binding upon it”.
is definition has been approved by the European Parliament.
Ombudsman (Article 43 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
Any citizen of the Union and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State has the right to refer to the Ombudsman of the Union cases of maladministration in the activities of the Community institutions or bodies, with the exception of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance acting in their judicial role.
) Decision of the European Parliament on the Regulations and General Conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsmans duties, OJ L 113/15, 4.5.1994.
A European administrative law
When it approved the Code, the European Parliament called on the European Commission to submit a proposal for a regulation containing the Code. e view was that a regulation would emphasise the binding nature of the rules and principles contained therein and apply uniformly to all EU institutions and bodies, thereby promoting transparency and consistency.
is goal could now best be achieved on the basis of a proposal from the Commission for a European law on good administration.
Article III-398 of the Constitution could provide the legal basis for such a law.
It states that:
“In carrying out their missions, the Institutions, bodies and agencies of the Union shall have the support of an open, e cient and independent European administration.
In compliance with the S t a Regulations and the Conditions of Employment adopted on the basis of Article III-427, European laws shall establish specific provisions to that end.” e Ombudsman will continue to emphasise the added value of transforming the Code into a European law. is would help eliminate the confusion currently arising from the parallel existence of different codes for most EU institutions and bodies, would ensure that the institutions and bodies apply the same basic principles in their relations with citizens and would underline, for both citizens and officials, the importance of such principles.
The European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour e Code approved by the European Parliament contains the following substantive provisions:
Article 1General provision
In their relations with the public, the Institutions and their officials shall respect the principles which are laid down in this Code of good administrative behaviour, herea er referred to as “the Code”.
Article 2Personal scope of application
Herea er the term official refers to both the officials and the other servants.

3. e official shall in particular avoid any unjustified discrimination between members of the public based on nationality, sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age, or sexual orientation.
Article 6Proportionality
When taking decisions, the official shall ensure that the measures taken are proportional to the aim pursued. e official shall in particular avoid restricting the rights of the citizens or imposing charges on them, when those restrictions or charges are not in a reasonable relation with the purpose of the action pursued.
When taking decisions, the official shall respect the fair balance between the interests of private persons and the general public interest.
Powers shall be exercised solely for the purposes for which they have been conferred by the relevant provisions. e official shall in particular avoid using those powers for purposes which have no basis in the law or which are not motivated by any public interest.
1. e official shall be impartial and independent. e official shall abstain from any arbitrary action adversely a ecting members of the public, as well as from any preferential treatment on any grounds whatsoever.
2. e conduct of the official shall never be guided by personal, family or national interest or by political pressure. e official shall not take part in a decision in which he or she, or any close member of his or her family, has a nancial interest.
Article 10Legitimate expectations, consistency and advice
1. e official shall be service-minded, correct, courteous and accessible in relations with the public.

Article 14Acknowledgement of receipt and indication of the competent official cial
Every letter or complaint to the Institution shall receive an acknowledgement of receipt within a period of two weeks, except if a substantive reply can be sent within that period.
No acknowledgement of receipt and no reply need be sent in cases where letters or complaints are abusive because of their excessive number or because of their repetitive or pointless character.
Article 15Obligation to transfer to the competent service of the Institution
If a letter or a complaint to the Institution is addressed or transmitted to a Directorate General, Directorate or Unit which has no competence to deal with it, its services shall ensure that the le is transferred without delay to the competent service of the Institution.
3. e official shall alert the member of the public or organisation to any errors or omissions in documents and provide an opportunity to rectify them.
In cases where the rights or interests of individuals are involved, the official shall ensure that, at every stage in the decision making procedure, the rights of defence are respected.

Article 18Duty to state the grounds of decisions
Every decision of the Institution which may adversely a ect the rights or interests of a private person shall state the grounds on which it is based by indicating clearly the relevant facts and the legal basis of the decision.
If it is not possible, because of the large number of persons concerned by similar decisions, to communicate in detail the grounds of the decision and where standard replies are therefore made, the official shall guarantee that he subsequently provides the citizen who expressly requests it with an individual reasoning.
Article 19Indication of the possibilities of appeal
Decisions shall in particular refer to the possibility of judicial proceedings and complaints to the Ombudsman under the conditions specified in, respectively, Articles 230 and 195 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.

It confirmed that it had, in the meantime, taken measures to accelerate payments to experts. The complainant subsequently pointed out that he had been paid within just 30 days for services rendered under his latest contract.
• The European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) agreed to clarify the information it provides in its notices of recruitment competitions concerning pre-selection tests and eligibility.
This followed a complaint from a Hungarian citizen who had applied to take part in a competition for assistant translators.
The Ombudsman felt that providing additional clarifications would help avoid misunderstandings and improve relations with candidates.
The European Ombudsman investigates complaints about maladministration in the institutions and bodies of the European Union.
The Ombudsman is completely independent and impartial.
The current Ombudsman is Mr P. Nikiforos Diamandouros who took office on 1 April 2003.
• The Ombudsman criticised the Council for failing to deal properly and carefully with a request for public access to documents.
This followed an inquiry which revealed that, contrary to the Council’s initial response to the complainant concerning the number of relevant documents, many additional documents in fact existed.
As a result of the Ombudsman’s investigation, the complainant was given access to the additional documents.

What outcome can be expected?
The Ombudsman cannot investigate: ombudsmen in the EU Member States, the applicant countries for EU membership, Norway and Iceland, as well as committees on petitions in the EU.

Who can complain and how?
What complaints can he deal with?
If you are a citizen of a Member State of the Union or reside in a Member State, you can make a complaint to the European Ombudsman.
Businesses, associations or other bodies with a registered office in the Union may also complain to the Ombudsman.
The Ombudsman investigates cases of maladministration (poor or failed administration).
Maladministration occurs if an institution fails to act in accordance with the law, fails to respect the principles of good administration, or violates human rights.
Some examples are:
• A Polish citizen, disabled as a result of a car accident, who alleged that the national social security institution had unfairly decided to suspend payment of his benefits.
With the complainant’s consent, the case was transferred to the Polish Ombudsman to be dealt with.
The European Ombudsman investigates complaints about maladministration in the institutions and bodies of the European Union (EU).
The institutions include, among others, the European Commission, the Council of the EU and the European Parliament.
The European Medicines Agency and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions are examples of Union bodies that he can investigate.
Only the Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance, and the Civil Service Tribunal acting in their judicial role do not fall within his jurisdiction.
Complaints can be lodged by post, fax or e-mail.
A complaint guide and form is available from the Ombudsman’s office and can be downloaded from the Ombudsman’s website.
The Ombudsman usually conducts inquiries on the basis of complaints but can also launch inquiries on his own initiative.
• administrative irregularities• unfairness• discrimination• abuse of power• failure to reply• refusal of information• unnecessary delay
• Spanish citizens who called for action at the EU and national levels to address the problem of illegal immigration from North Africa.
As the issue fell outside the European Ombudsman’s mandate, he advised the complainants to turn to the Spanish Ombudsman regarding the national authorities and to petition the European Parliament, which has both investigatory and legislative powers that could be used in relation to this matter at the EU level.
If the Ombudsman is not able to investigate the complaint – for example, if it concerns national, regional or local administrations in the Member States – he will still do his best to help you solve your problem.
This very often involves transferring the case to a member of the European Network of Ombudsmen or advising you to contact a member of the Network.
Established in 1996, the Network comprises all national and regional
The Europol staff will continue to increase up to 485 by the end of 2004, including the ELOs and security personnel.

Noting that the European Union was coming to a turning point in its existence, the European Council which met in Laeken, Belgium, on 14 and 15December2001 convened the European Convention on the Future of Europe.
The Convention was asked to draw up proposals on three subjects: how to bring citizenscloser to the European design and European Institutions; how to organise politics and the European political area in an enlarged Union; and how to develop the Union into a stabilising factor and a model in the new world order.
The Convention has identified responses to the questions put in the Laeken declaration:
–it proposes a better division of Union and Member State competences;–it recommends a merger of the Treaties and the attribution of legal personality to the Union; – it establishes a simplification of the Union’s instruments of action;–it proposes measures to increase the democracy, transparency and efficiency of the European Union, by developing the contribution of national Parliaments to the legitimacy of the European design, by simplifying the decisionmaking processes, and bymaking the functioning of the European Institutions more transparent and compre-hensible;–it establishes the necessary measures to improve the structure and enhance the role ofeach of the Union’s three institutions, taking account, in particular, of the consequences of enlargement.
The Laeken declaration also asked whether the simplification and reorganisation of the Treaties should not pave the way for the adoption of a constitutional text. The Convention’s proceedings ultimately led to the drawing up of a draft Treaty establishinga Constitution for Europe, which achieved a broad consensus at the plenary session on13June2003.
DRAFT TREATY ESTABLISHING A CONSTITUTION FOR EUROPE
Our Constitution ... is called a democracy because power is in the hands not of a minority but of the greatestnumber.
Conscious that Europe is a continent that has brought forth civilisation; that its inhabitants, arriving in successive waves from earliest times, have gradually developed the values underlying humanism: equality of persons, freedom, respect for reason,
Drawing inspiration from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, thevalues of which, still present in its heritage, have embedded within the life of society thecentral role of the human person and his or her inviolable and inalienable rights, andrespect for law,
Believing that reunited Europe intends to continue along the path of civilisation, progressand prosperity, for the good of all its inhabitants, including the weakest and mostdeprived; that it wishes to remain a continent open to culture, learning and socialprogress; and that it wishes to deepen the democratic and transparent nature of its publiclife, and to strive for peace, justice and solidarity throughout the world,
Convinced that, while remaining proud of their own national identities and history, thepeoples of Europe are determined to transcend their ancient divisions and, united evermore closely, to forge a common destiny,
Convinced that, thus “united in its diversity”, Europe offers them the best chance of pursuing, with due regard for the rights of each individual and in awareness of their responsibilities towards future generations and the Earth, the great venture which makes of it aspecial area of human hope,
Grateful to the members of the European Convention for having prepared this Constitution on behalf of the citizens and States of Europe,

Meeting the challenges of the plant breeding industry
Established: 2000
The European Agency for Reconstruction manages the EU’s main assistance programmes in Serbia (including Kosovo), Montenegro, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Established in 2000 for Kosovo, the geographical coverage of the Agency was later expanded.
The Agency with its headquarters in Thessaloniki, Greece has operational centres in Pristina, Belgrade, Podgorica and Skopje.
It is an independent EU agency, accountable to the Council and the European Parliament, and overseen by a governing board of representatives of the 27 EU Member States and the European Commission.
The Agency initially had a five-year mandate (from 2000 to 2004).
This has been extended twice by Council Decisions, and the mandate currently runs until the end of 2008.
The total portfolio of EU assistance programmes managed by the Agency since 2000 stands at EUR 2.86 billion,

European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) promoting a culture of risk prevention.
Located in Bilbao, Spain, EU-OSHA has a dedicated staff of OSH specialists and a network of partners in all Member States and beyond.At the national level we are represented by a network of focal points, which are typically the lead OSH organisations in their respective countries.
These focal points work with government, employers’and workers’representatives, providing information and advice to support agency initiatives.
They also manage the national agency websites, organise European campaign events in the individual Member States, and nominate representatives to expert groups, which provide advice to EU-OSHA in their own field of expertise.Safety and health is an ethical issue, a basic human right, but it is also about company productivity and competitiveness.
Safety and health at work is one of the European Union’s most important and challenging policy areas.Statistics show that every five seconds a worker in the EU is involved in a work-related accident, and every three-and-a-half minutes someone in the EU dies from work-related causes.Workers need to be made aware of the risks that they face and how to deal with them. Employers need to know what they must do to keep their employees safe and how to do it.
But occupational safety and health (OSH) issues are complex and diverse.
Dealing with them effectively and equitably is more than individual organisations or Member States can manage alone.That is why the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work was set up in 1996.
We collect, analyse and communicate OSH-related infor -mation across the EU.
Our mission is to make Europe’s workplaces safer, healthier and more productive, by

European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex)
Established: 2004
National border security systems are being complemented by a unified set of effective tools to manage potential risks at the external borders, while the responsibility for the control of external borders lies with Member States.
Frontex was created particularly to integrate national border management systems of Member States against all kind of threats that could happen at or through the external border of the Member States of the European Union.
Established: 2003
Director: Patrick Goudou
Sta: currently 350
The agency’s responsibilities are growing to meet the challenges of the fast-developing aviation sector.
In the future this will include legally binding rules for flight operations, the licensing of flight crews and the safety approval of non-European airlines.Based in Cologne, the agency already employs over 350 professionals from across Europe.
It will continue to recruit highly qualified specialists and administrators in the coming years as it consolidates its position as Europe’s centre of excellence in aviation safety.Our vision is to see European citizens benefit from the safest and most environment-friendly civil aviation system in the world.

As infectious diseases can spread internationally at alarming speed, coordinated efforts are needed at European level to enhance prevention and control measures.
To strengthen Europe’s defences against infectious disease, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) works closely with national disease control organisations, EU-level authorities and international organisations, encouraging cooperation and the pooling of knowledge.
The ECDC’s mission is to identify, assess and communicate threats to human health from infectious diseases in Europe.The main areas of the ECDC’s activities include providing scientific advice, strengthening Europe-wide surveillance (collection and dissemination of relevant data on infectious diseases), reinforcing and developing Europe’s rapid alert systems against disease outbreaks, and supporting countries in strengthening their preparedness against and response to epidemics.
The centre has a mandate to communicate both to stakeholders and the general public information concerning its activities.
It offers technical assistance and training to Member States’authorities and facilitates the sharing of expertise and best practices.
The centre publishes numerous reports on specific diseas-

European Environment Agency (EEA)
Established: 1994
The European Environment Agency (EEA) is the EU body dedicated to providing sound, independent information on the environment.
We are the main information source for those involved in developing, adopting, implementing and evaluating environmental policy, as well as for the general public.Our aim is to help the EU and its member countries make informed decisions about improving the environment, integrating environmental considerations into economic policies and moving towards sustainability.We provide a wide range of information and assessments, covering the state of the environment and trends in it, pressures on the environment and the economic and social driving forces behind them.
Our work also covers policies and their e ective-ness.
We try to identify possible future trends and problems using scenarios and other techniques.A major source of information is the European environment information and observation network (Eionet).
The EEA is responsible for developing the network and coordinating its activities.
We work closely together with the national focal points (NFPs), typically national environment agencies or environment ministries in the member countries.

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)
Sta: 300 (end of 2007)
Following a series of food crises in the late 1990s, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was created as part of a comprehensive programme to improve EU food safety, ensure a high level of consumer protection and restore and maintain confidence in the EU food supply.
The authority was formally set up in January 2002 as an independent source of scientific advice and communication on risks associated with the food chain.In the EU food safety system, risk assessment is carried out separately from risk management.
As the risk assessor, EFSA delivers scientific advice to provide a sound foundation for European policies, legislation and decisions.
EFSA’s opinions inform EU risk managers: the European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States.
EFSA also undertakes work on its own initiative, particularly in fields where knowledge is evolving, such as

European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA)
Established: 2007
Director: vacant
The European Union is based on principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.
It has a Charter of Fundamental Rights which reflects the rights common to the constitutional traditions and international obligations of its Member States.
It is important that greater knowledge and awareness of these rights and issues related to them inform EU action.
The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) has been set up to contribute to that process. The agency will provide assistance and expertise relating to fundamental rights, in line with Community law, to Community institutions and bodies and Member States.
It will achieve this via the principal tasks of data collection, improving comparability and reliability of data, research and analysis, cooperation with international organisations, national specialised bodies and civil society, and raising public awareness of fundamental rights.
It will get the results out in the form of conclusions and opinions to policymakers, stakeholders and those who implement policy and take action at the key levels of the EU and its Member States.
The goal is to build respect and promotion of fundamental rights as part of the value system

Eurojust operates as a college consisting of 27 national members, one from each Member State, permanently working in The Hague.
The national members are senior, experienced prosecutors or judges.
Some national members are supported by deputies or assistants.
Eurojust’s vision is to be the key player and centre of excellence at a judicial level for effective action against organised cross-border crime in the EU.As the first permanent body established for judicial cooperation in the European legal area, or indeed anywhere in the world, it is the mission of Eurojust to enhance Europe-wide cooperation to deal more effectively with transnational criminal cases.
The objective for Eurojust is to enhance the efficiency of the national investigating and prosecuting authorities, individually and collectively, when dealing with serious cross-border crime and more importantly to bring criminals to justice quickly and ef- ficiently.

European Medicines Agency (EMEA)
Established: 1993
Address: 7 Westferry Circus Canary Wharf London E14 4HBUnited Kingdom
Five scientific committees currently exist within EMEA, with individual responsibilities for medicines for human use, medicines for veterinary use, medicines for paediatric use, medicines for rare diseases and herbal medicines.
These committees comprise representatives from all Member States, and use the best-available resources in Europe to formulate objective opinions based on purely scientific criteria.
Some committees also include representatives of patients’and healthcare professionals’ organisations.Alongside this core scientific work, EMEA contributes towards the development of transparent and harmonised regulatory practices, towards creating the right environment for innovation in the EU and towards the provision of clear information about authorised medicinal products for patients, healthcare professionals and the general public.Founded on international cooperation, driven by science and motivated by the need for high-quality, safe and effective medicines, EMEA is a champion for better health in Europe.
High-quality, safe and effective medicines play an important role in the protection of public and animal health in our society.
Without them, the efforts of healthcare professionals working on the prevention and treatment of illness and disease would be severely undermined.The European Medicines Agency (EMEA), working closely with the Member States and institutions of the European Union, contributes towards the availability of appropriate medicines by: stimulating the development of innovative new medicines; assisting pharmaceutical companies with procedures for authorising their medicinal products; evaluating the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines prior to authorisation; constantly monitoring medicines once they are on the market.EMEA was set up to coordinate the evaluation and supervision of medicinal products in accordance with the EU’s centralised procedure for the authorisation of pharmaceuticals.
Using this procedure, companies can submit a single application to the EMEA, which, pending a positive opinion from the agency’s relevant scientific committee, can result in the granting of an EU-wide marketing authorisation by the European Commission.

European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)
Established: 1993
The EMCDDA therefore relies on a network of some 30 national monitoring centres (Reitox network) to gather and analyse country data according to common data-collection standards and tools.
With the production of cocaine and heroin at historically high levels and with over 7 000 Europeans dying every year of drug overdoses, constant monitoring is imperative.

This stems from the complexity of information systems, accidents, mistakes and attacks to the infrastructures delivering critical services to the EU citizens.
This future needs to be defended.
That is why ENISA is working on network and information security for the EU and the Member States, giving expert advice, recommendations and information on best practices, and facilitating contacts between the EU institutions, the Member States and private business and industry.ENISA consequently contributes to modernising Europe and securing the smooth functioning of the digital economy and information society.

The CEPOL Secretariat is based at Bramshill, approximately 70 km west of London.The agency cooperates with a wide range of partners, including other law enforcement agencies such as Europol, Eurojust and Interpol.
CEPOL has working agreements with non-EU Member States (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) and has built relationships with non-EU Member States and different universities and research institutes.The acronym CEPOL is French and stands for Collège européen de police — European Police College (in English).CEPOL has an annual budget of about EUR 7.5 million (2007) and is funded by the European Communities.
CEPOL brings together senior police officers, supports the development of a network and encourages cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime, public security and law and order. CEPOL particularly focuses on: combating cross-border crime through specialist training; disseminating best practice and research findings; facilitating exchanges and secondments between police forces; providing training for trainers; developing common curricula to harmonise training programmes; providing training for police authorities in candidate countries; providing an electronic network for sharing knowledge and best practice.CEPOL organises between 80 and 100 courses, seminars and conferences per year on key topics relevant to police forces in Europe today.
The implementation of the activities takes place at the national police training colleges.
In 2007, some 1 350 senior police officers attended a CEPOL activity.CEPOL was estab-

Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union (CdT)
Established: 1994
Our second mission is to contribute actively to cooperation between the EU’s various translation services.
The objective of this interinstitutional cooperation is to rationalise working methods, to harmonise procedures and to make overall savings in the field of translation in the EU.One of the most striking achievements of that cooperation is without doubt the creation of the EU terminology database IATE (Inter Active Terminology for Europe).
The IATE project was launched by the Translation Centre in 1999 and has brought together the terminological resources of all the EU translation services.
With over 8.5 million terms, IATE is today the biggest terminology resource in the world.
The European Union’s language policy clearly recognises that linguistic diversity is an asset that has to be preserved and promoted.
The Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union is one of the bodies which helps implement the EU’s strategic framework for multilingualism.The Translation Centre was established to provide translation services to the other decentralised EU agencies and to assist those EU institutions and bodies which have their own translation services in times of peaks in workload.
We provide these services on the basis of a cooperation agreement concluded with each client.
Today, we translate for over 30 EU agencies, institutions and other bodies.

European Defence Agency (EDA)
Established: 2004
Website: www.eda.europa.eu of a European defence R & T strategy which identifies priorities; promoting European cooperation on defence equipment, both to contribute to defence capabilities and as a catalyst for further restructuring the European defence industry; and working, in close cooperation with the Commission, on steps towards an internationally competitive market for defence equipment in Europe.The agency’s‘comparative advan-tage’ should be its ability to comprehend all these agendas, and relate them so as to realise their synergies. The European Defence Agency has been created to help EU Member States develop their defence capabilities for crisis-management operations under the European security and defence policy (ESDP).
The agency’s tasks include working towards a more comprehensive and systematic approach to defining and meeting the capability needs of the ESDP, promoting European defence-relevant R & T as vital both to a healthy defence technological and industrial base, and defining and satisfying future capability requirements. This will involve: pursuing collaborative use of national defence R & T funds, in the context European Union Institute for Security Studies (ISS)
Established: 2001
The European Union Institute for Security Studies was created by a Council joint action on 20 July 2001.
Its aim is to help create a common European security culture, to support the strategic debate by providing the best possible interface between Euro -pean decisionmakers and the diverse circles of non-official specialists.
The institute’s activities are directed towards data analysis and recommendations necessary for EU policymaking.
Consequently, the institute contributes to the development of the European Union common foreign and security policy (CFSP) by executing several main tasks: research and debate on the major security and defence issues that are of relevance to the EU; forward-looking analysis for the Union’s Council and High Representative; and development of a transatlantic dialogue on all security issues with the countries of Europe, Canada and the United States.
The institute has an autonomous status and intellectual freedom, which means that it does not represent or defend any particular national interest.
Who we are
Illicit drug use and trafficking are worldwide phenomena that threaten health and social stability.
Statistics show that one European citizen dies every hour from a drug overdose and close to 8 000 Europeans lose their lives to drugs every year.
Meanwhile, ever-changing patterns in supply and demand call for constant monitoring and dynamic responses.
Established: 1993Director: Wolfgang Götz Staff: 100info@emcdda.europa.eu www.emcdda.europa.eu
Independent, science-based information is a vital resource to help Europe understand the nature of its drug problems and better respond to them.
It was on this premise, and in the face of an escalating drug phenomenon, that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) was established in 1993.
Inaugurated in Lisbon in 1995, it is one of the EU’s decentralised agencies.
The EMCDDA exists to provide the EU and its Member States with a factual overview of European drug problems and a solid evidence base to support the drugs debate.
Today it offers policymakers the data they need for drawing up informed drug laws and strategies.
It also helps professionals and practitioners working in the field pinpoint best practice and new areas of research.
At the heart of the agency’s work is the promotion of scientific excellence.
To achieve its core task of providing sound and comparable information on drugs in Europe, the EMCDDA has developed the infrastructure and tools needed to collect country data in a harmonised way.
These data are then fed by national drug monitoring centres (Reitox network) to the Lisbon agency for analysis, resulting in a variety of information products conveying the broader European picture.
While the EMCDDA is primarily European in focus, it also works with partners in other world regions, exchanging information and expertise.
Collaboration with European and international organisations in the drugs field is also central to its work as a means of enhancing understanding of the global drugs phenomenon.
The EMCDDA works on the principle that sound information is the key to an effective strategy on drugs.
Although it does not propose policy, the agency is now making a clear impact on decision-making through its analyses, standards and tools.
What we do
The state of the drugs problem in Europe
The EMCDDA’s main output is its yearly overview of the European drug phenomenon which it presents in a multilingual annual report package.
This is essential reading for policymakers, scientists and practitioners in the drugs field or anyone seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe.

Monitoring the drug situation
The EMCDDA would not be complete without Reitox — the European information network on drugs and drug addiction — which comprises national drug monitoring centres or ‘focal points’ in the 27 EU Member States, candidate countries to the EU, Norway and at the European Commission.
These bodies are the main information interface between the EMCDDA and its Member States.
As such, they provide national drug information to the agency for EU-level analysis and play the role of EMCDDA ‘ambassadors’ at home.
Understanding the nature and scale of the drugs problem is a critical requirement for effective policymaking and action.
The EMCDDA uses a variety of monitoring methods and tools (e.g. key indicators, core datasets) which offer countries a ‘common language’ with which to interpret the drug phenomenon.
As well as monitoring the drug situation today, the EMCDDA is ever vigilant to new drugs and trends that may pose a future threat to our societies.
Here it plays an active role in early-warning and risk-assessment activities through legal instruments and case studies.

Responding to drug problems n u l l
Monitoring drug interventions, laws and policies is firmly enshrined in the EMCDDA’s work.
By providing a European overview of such responses to drug problems, it helps countries follow trends and design appropriate strategies.
The agency has developed a number of mechanisms to describe the availability and nature of responses as well as a variety of tools to evaluate them.

Conclusions
Building a more accurate picture of the drugs situation; addressing both supply and demand issues; identifying emerging trends at an early stage; sharing objective information on best practices for the planning and organisation of interventions, and; providing decisionmakers with the evidence needed for the design of national and regional drugs strategies and their evaluation.
These are just some of the challenges shared on both sides of the Atlantic by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States (CICAD–OAS).
In this context, national drugs observatories — or national focal points as they are called in the European Union — play a critical role, as the data and information they provide is the cornerstone of any drugs monitoring system.
National drugs observatories have flourished and developed rapidly over the last two decades as a direct consequence of the decisions taken to establish regional drug monitoring systems, both in the European Union and in the Americas.
Initially, there was no reference framework available — observatories were set up using trial and error, taking into account different national contexts and resources.
This explains why today there are as many models of observatories as there are countries establishing them.
Looking back at this long process, there seemed to be a need to formalise the experiences in the field, and to identify some key concepts and principles that remain valid irrespective of country or region.
The EMCDDA and CICAD–OAS are proud to present this joint handbook on building national drugs observatories, which for the first time presents and describes in a clear and informative way the core operational processes and the key strategic factors that are common to all national drugs observatories.
Starting from a highly heterogeneous group of drugs observatories across different continents, the endeavour is to extract the essence of their experience and to transmit the final result in such a way that it can be reinterpreted in other realities and conditions.
We have therefore structured the handbook in thematic chapters which enable the reader to either use it as a classical step-by-step approach, or invest more time and attention to a specific phase in the process of building or consolidating a national drugs observatory.
Although this is the outcome of a long elaboration and reflection process, the handbook itself should be considered more as a starting point, rather than as a final achievement.
Building a national drugs observatory: a joint handbook documents.
Over time, the toolbox will develop with the help of readers and operational national drugs observatories: it will provide a platform for sharing practical materials and reference models.
We invite you to join this virtual community of national drugs observatories and share your views and experiences in order to contribute to the development of the handbook and the toolbox, which in turn will help others build their own national drugs observatories.

Chapter 1Why do we need a national drugs observatory?
What is a national drugs observatory (NDO)?
What is its role?
What are the duties and the competences of such an institution?
How can one set up an observatory?
These are only a few of the questions that this handbook tries to address in a practical manner, starting with the most important one: why do we need a national drugs observatory?
A growing need for monitoring
The adoption of the United Nations Conventions (
States to regularly report on the drugs situation as well as on interventions, covering both supply and demand.
More recently, other international and regional organisations developing activities in the general context of the fight against drugs have progressively moved towards comprehensive strategies and action plans that are target or objective based, and that have increasingly required reliable data to assess the drugs situation and to monitor the implementation of measures taken.
This concern has led to the development and subsequent changes to the structure, content and objectives of the European Union’s drugs strategies since the adoption of the first European Action Plan to Combat Drugs in December 1990.
In the Americas, this started with the establishment of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1986 as the western hemisphere’s policy forum on all aspects of the drug problem.
One of the first consequences of this formalised approach was an acknowledgement of the need to set up national monitoring systems and observatories.
‘Evidence base’: a new concept for policymaking
Since the mid-1990s, the concept of ‘evidence-based policy-making’ has emerged as a new standard in public management (see box below).
These are: the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf); the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 (http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1971_en.pdf); and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 (http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1988_en.pdf)
Evidence-based policy has been defined as an approach that ‘helps people make well informed decisions about policies, programmes and projects by putting the best available evidence from research at the heart of policy development and implementation’.
This approach stands in contrast to opinion-based policy, which relies heavily on either the selective use of evidence (e.g. on single studies irrespective of quality) or on the untested views of individuals or groups, often inspired by ideological standpoints, prejudices, or speculative conjecture.
This change highlights the need for governments to take better informed decisions, and to assess whether the measures taken have been implemented and if they have been successful.
Two trends have developed in parallel in this area: political leaders need tools to evaluate if the measures and interventions implemented have had an impact, and if so, what impact.
Similarly, the public is increasingly demanding this sort of information from its leaders.
From monitoring to evaluation
In the field of drugs, over the last seven to eight years there has been an increased number of initiatives at national or regional level to evaluate or carry out an impact assessment of anti-drugs strategies and other national action plans.
For instance, in the two regions mentioned above, data collected at national level also serve the purpose of evaluating the outcomes of regional anti-drugs strategies: in Europe this is the evaluation of the EU Action Plan made by the European Commission, and in the Organization of American States, this is the scope and objective of the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism.
At global level, the international community gave additional support to the strengthening and further developing of drug information networks to underpin the assessment and evaluation of anti-drugs strategies during the 10-year review of the Political Declaration of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Drugs in 1998.
Indeed, a new resolution ‘Invites Member States to strengthen their efforts to review and improve data collection tools in order to attain an objective, scientific, balanced and transparent assessment of the progress made and the obstacles encountered in implementing
2 the Political Declaration and Plan of Action (…)’ (
‘Improving the collection, reporting and analysis of data to monitor the implementation of the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem’ (Resolution 52/12) — Economic and Social Council Official Records, 2009, Supplement No 8 — Commission on Narcotic Drugs, Report on the fifty-second session (14 March 2008 and 11–20 March 2009), p. 29.
A key role for national observatories
What we can conclude from the various working groups, public and expert debates that took place in 2008 and 2009 and that are still ongoing, is very simple:
• supranational or international drug information networks can only work if they receive high quality, comparable information from their respective participating countries;
• national drugs observatories can make a key contribution to international community efforts on data collection, analysis and interpretation;
• a national drugs observatory is a key instrument for policymaking — it is not a political instrument.
Whilst the political responsibility remains in the hands of decision-makers, there is a growing consensus that they need objective, factual, reliable and comparable information in order to take informed decisions.
This handbook targets the needs of three groups, with a specific objective for each of them:
• countries that are or that may become candidates to EU membership (3), and neighbourhood countries (4) that wish and/or need to prepare themselves to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction;
• countries that are part of other regional data collection systems on drugs, such as the Interamerican Drugs Observatory CICAD–OAS, to assess their situation and to build strategies so as to improve and/or to consolidate their national observatories;
• non-EU countries involved in a cooperation on drugs matters with the EU and with other
), and with public and private international donors in the drugs field that want to evaluate the effectiveness of their grants and activities.
We must inform the reader of the following in relation to this publication:
• this handbook builds on the experience of establishing and developing a European data collection network composed by national focal points — the Reitox network.
Although it presents a conceptual framework, it is based on practice in establishing the network 15 years ago, and in expanding it to more than 15 new countries since then.
We have tried to identify the key principles and functions that have proven successful over the years;
• we do not offer a single model to be copied, but strategic and operational steps and an indication of the sorts of decisions that should be taken on the basis of a structured analysis of each national context.
This handbook provides the reader with a matrix for this strategic and operational analysis;
• a national drugs observatory is nothing without data and information, which are frequently produced by other entities, at different levels (national, local); therefore setting up a national drugs observatory goes alongside the creation/strengthening of a national drugs information network;
• this handbook is the result of a strategic partnership between two regional organisations, the EMCDDA in the European Union and CICAD-OAS in the Americas, with the aim to further support national monitoring capacity in their respective Member States.
The handbook is divided into several parts:
• What is a national drugs observatory (Chapter 2)• Running a national drugs observatory:
A national drugs observatory (NDO) is an organisation that provides its country with factual, objective, reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences.
The objectives of the NDO are:
• to provide its national audience with the information seen as essential for policymaking and for the organisation of drug-related services, and on drug-related issues of general interest;
• to collect and to produce the information needed to fulfil its country’s reporting obligations to supranational and international monitoring and drug-control programmes.
To reach its objectives, the NDO must perform three core functions, either with its own resources or in conjunction with other national institutions and experts:
• data collection and monitoring at national level;• analysis and interpretation of the information collected;• reporting and dissemination of the results.
The main publication produced by the NDO on a yearly basis is its national report or at least an update on the national situation.
In addition to this report, an NDO may be expected to produce ad hoc studies and other reports.
While establishing or evaluating the position of a national drugs observatory, it is also necessary to assess its success and sustainability using three key strategic factors:
• perceived added value;• availability and combination of resources; and• cooperative production processes.
A national drugs observatory (NDO) is an organisation that aims to provide — for its home country — factual, objective, reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and
1 drug addiction (
), and their consequences.
According to national priorities, the scope of the work of the NDO may focus only on illicit drugs, or could also cover alcohol, tobacco and other licit drugs (such as prescription drugs).
We limit our presentation here to illicit drugs as these are the primary mandate of the EMCDDA and CICAD-OAS.
An NDO is ideally part of a broader system that combines:
• a concerted and balanced national drugs coordination mechanism, which oversees the various actors implementing a national drugs strategy;
• a national drugs information network, that integrates specialised and general sources of information and expertise, as well as routine surveillance programmes and ad hoc surveys on target groups.
The NDO collects and produces information for two main audiences: national and supra- or international.
National audience: the NDO addresses the information needs of four groups of customers which make up its audience at national level: decision-makers, the scientific community, professionals working in the drugs field, and the general public.
Supra- or international audience: the work of the NDO also has international uses, within the context of overall efforts to reduce drug problems at global (United Nations) and supranational levels (e.g. European Union, Organization of American States etc.).
As far as the work of an NDO is concerned, we use the term ‘core functions’ to describe the key processes to be developed and implemented by the NDO.
In order to present the core functions of an NDO, we have adapted the concept of ‘business process’.
What is ‘business process’?
Davenport and Short (1990) define business process as ‘a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome.’
A process is ‘a structured, measured set of activities designed to produce a specified output for a particular customer or market. It
2 implies a strong emphasis on how work is done within an organisation’ (
Business processes have four common characteristics:
Cross-organisational boundaries: the NDO relies on a multi-partner cooperation framework, on intensive networking practices that allow the NDO to acquire the expertise and information needed.
This implies a permanent screening of its environment and frequent adjustments in the modus operandi negotiated with all partners.
Customers or stakeholders: in organisations based in or depending on the public sector, stakeholders play a vital role because they attract funds and allow the NDO to operate.
Malhotra, Y., ‘Business process redesign: an overview’, IEEE Engineering Management Review, volume 26, No 3, Autumn 1998.
Process: the emphasis is on how activities are organised and how results are obtained.
The processes may be structured differently, according to context, resources and capabilities, provided that the expected outputs are clearly defined and are produced on time.
Output: each of the core functions should deliver outputs, whether raw data or specific information, analytical reports, targeted publications or standard reporting.
The three core functions of an NDO are:
• data collection and monitoring• analysis and interpretation of the data collected• reporting and dissemination of results.
The core functions are usually carried out by the NDO in conjunction with other national institutions and experts.
Depending on the resources and the mandate of the NDO, and on the data and expertise available in the country, a range of possible set-ups are possible, as presented in Chapter 7 — Challenging questions).
What matters is that these functions show the highest possible level of quality and meet scientific standards, as they lie at the heart of the reputation and perceived added value of the NDO’s work.
In the European Union, this is the role of the EMCDDA’s national focal points, which together form the European network for data collection on drugs, called Reitox (Réseau Européen d’Information sur les Toxicomanies).
Data collection and monitoring at national level
Various kinds of drug-related information are usually already produced in some form by agencies at local or national level.
In such cases, the NDO can have the role of bringing together all available information into a national picture.
In order to do so, the NDO must first identify what information is available and create an ‘information map’.
This is a document that identifies and classifies potential data providers of drugs information and partner organisations.
Part of the work of an NDO consists of ‘scanning’ national sources of drug-related information to identify strengths and gaps.
Based on the potential partners and data providers identified in the information map, a national drug information network is put together, representing the know-how ’in the field’, that ultimately underpins the quality of the NDO’s outputs.
In order to gather, produce, analyse and disseminate information in a regular manner, the NDO must build a sustainable network that is able to work continuously on its own improvement.
One of the main tasks of the NDO is to establish a national drug information network together with the partners and resources identified in the information map.
The drugs phenomenon and its impact on society are permanently changing.
Science, and our knowledge and understanding of the drugs phenomenon, are also in constant evolution.
The demands placed on the drugs information network must therefore be responsive to change.
In other words, developing the drug information network, and the related networking tasks, is part of an ongoing process that represents the NDO’s principal and most time-consuming activity.
A key task is to liaise with information or data providers, and to motivate them to participate and contribute to the national drug information network.
Another ongoing aspect of developing the aforementioned network is a constant effort to improve the knowledge base.
This may be achieved either by improving existing processes and national reporting standards, and/or by establishing new sources of information.
The ability to raise awareness and funds for improving the national data collection network is extremely useful in this context.
The NDO needs staff with excellent communication and negotiation skills and a proven capacity for consensus-building.
To manage the data sources in all drug-related areas, and to maintain a comprehensive drug information network, the main challenge for data providers in both the supply and demand reduction fields is to learn to work together and share information with professionals working in different areas, with varying objectives, professional cultures and traditions.
The challenge for the NDO lies in the constant and mutual interconnection of supply- and demandrelated information networks, in a way that offers added value for all partners and is logistically feasible.
The role of the NDO is not limited to just collecting existing information and data: it plays a key role in keeping track of data sets and promoting the improvement of their quality among its partners year after year, either through technical and methodological support, or by bringing together key national experts to improve the reliability and validity of data from year to year.
The NDO needs to organise and maintain the memory of the data available, developing a scientific and methodological capacity for data collection, data analysis, quality assurance, and capacity development both in-house and within the network.
Analysis and interpretation of the information collected
The information gathered by means of the drug information network needs further processing to be of practical use to the NDO’s audiences.
This is usually done by combining the analytical capacity of NDO staff and national experts.
The NDO progressively builds its expertise in providing rigorous scientific, unbiased and non-speculative interpretation and analysis of the data collected, and in synthesising it into
The analysis and interpretation of the information collected should focus on:
• analysing and interpreting the information, in consultation with those who provided it;
• integrating information derived from different sources, covering a range of areas, in order to provide a comprehensive overview and understanding of the drugs situation.
To carry out these activities, the NDO must work with national institutions and other experts, so as to ensure:
• the progressive building of a common and comprehensive picture of the drugs situation in the country concerned;
• shared ownership of the results by all partners involved.
Reporting and dissemination of results
Reporting and communicating results should be seen as one of the key tasks of the national drugs observatory.
The NDO should therefore develop a communication strategy that helps meet and fulfil existing needs, yet can also address and anticipate future needs in a proactive way that is tailored to its different audiences.
Ultimately, outputs help justify the NDO’s existence, and they are one of the main reasons why it receives funds from national authorities and international organisations.
In most cases, the main publication produced by the NDO on a yearly basis will be a national report or an executive summary of the latest developments in the national context.
It is of particular importance that the NDO provides an update of the national drugs situation yearly, both for national and for international purposes.
In addition to the national report, the NDO may also be expected to produce reports on ad hoc studies and to provide evidence for the evaluation of national strategies and action plans.
Further publications may also include special reports on specific drug-related issues of national interest, scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals, special periodic and one-off publications, press releases and media relations tools, and web-based publications (websites, mailing lists, and so on).
To assess the strategic position of an NDO, the first point to consider is the institutional issues, i.e. the NDO’s role, status and mandate. However, although these issues are important, they cannot alone predict success or failure.
• Perceived added value: whatever the motivation for establishing an NDO (national or supranational), it is essential to make sure the NDO builds an image of competence and of service to national and local shareholders, as they have the main power of decision when it comes to settingup and funding the NDO and the national data collection network;
• Combined resources: in practice, a successful NDO is the result of a combination of local, national and supranational resources, whether human, scientific and/or financial.
Therefore, special attention should be paid to identifying, articulating and consolidating these resources;
• Co-production: the NDO’s outputs are not produced in isolation, they are usually the result of a sometimes complex co-production process involving other institutions and experts who have specific data or knowledge on the chosen subject.
A critical issue for the development and strengthening of the NDO lies within its capacity and its processes for the production of reports and other publications in cooperation with its national and local partners.
Chapter 3Running a national drugs observatory — data collection and monitoring
What are we looking for?
How to proceed?
The NDO’s primary objective is to collect and/or to generate the information needed to build a comprehensive picture of the drugs situation in a given country, covering both supply and demand and responses.
• adopting international reference tools;• building or adopting a reference framework for reporting;• finding the data and experts to interpret the data;• structuring the sources of information into a coherent system;• progressively creating and developing a national data collection network.
What kind of data/information are needed?
Monitoring and other drug-related data collection activities started three decades ago in different regions of the world, under the auspices of various international and regional organisations.
In 2000, an international expert meeting held in Lisbon led to the adoption of a common reference framework for data collection and monitoring shared by international and
1 supranational organisations, called the Lisbon Consensus (
The meeting, which was funded by the United Nations Drugs Control Programme (UNDCP) and hosted by the EMCDDA, brought together various experts and representatives from organisations such as the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe, UNAIDS, the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States (CICAD–

OAS), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the World Health Organization, the International Epidemiology Workgroup and the Global HIV Prevention Research Network.
The Lisbon Consensus identifies 13 areas of strategic/policy interest which are monitored using a range of tools and formats, by all supranational and international organisations:
• Drug consumption among the general population (prevalence and incidence);
• Drug consumption by young people (prevalence and incidence);
• Drug consumption by special or vulnerable populations;
• High-risk drug consumption (e.g. injecting, dependence etc.);
• Drug-related morbidity;
• Drug-related emergency room visits;
• Psychiatric morbidity directly attributed to drug consumption;
• Drug-related mortality;
• Social exclusion and disadvantage;
• Drug-related crime (violations of drug laws; proportion of property crimes associated with drug consumption; proportion of violent crimes associated with drug consumption);
• Economic costs of drug consumption;
Information on drug availability and drug markets.
Based on this list, each regional or international drug monitoring network has developed its own model taking into account its specific needs and its institutional environment, but the core data remain the same.
As this handbook is a joint publication between the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States (CICAD–OAS), we will briefly introduce their respective reference frameworks.
Further comments will be made in Chapter 5, under the heading ‘Reporting to supranational and international organisations’.
The European monitoring system: the EMCDDA
In the European Union, the EMCDDA has developed a reference framework for monitoring the drugs phenomenon that is translated into a unique regional data collection network, delivering a consistent, harmonised and standardised national reporting package covering 30 and soon 36 countries each year.
The EMCDDA relies on a network of national focal points or national drugs observatories — the Reitox network — which is responsible for collecting the data at national level.
One of the key assets of this monitoring system is that it is compulsory for EU Member States
As such, and the fact that it is one of the instruments of the European approach on drugs ( its adoption and transposition at national level is mandatory for any country seeking future EU membership.
The European monitoring system developed by the EMCDDA (
) is structured so as to cover two main areas: ‘monitoring the situation’ which covers epidemiology, crime and markets, and ‘monitoring responses’ which covers interventions, law and policies.
Monitoring the situation — Epidemiology, crime and markets
Work in this area is structured around three main components: key epidemiological indicators, crime and markets and the action on new drugs.
5 key epidemiological indicators:
Drug situation: Epidemiology, crime and markets
General population surveys and youth surveys Problem drug use Treatment demand indicator Drug-related deaths Drug-related infectious diseases
Crime and markets:
Drug-related crime Availability of illicit drugs
Action on new drugs:
Early warning system Risk assessment Control measures
Key epidemiological indicators (
The EMCDDA uses five key epidemiological indicators that have been developed by the Centre in close collaboration with the Reitox network, experts across Europe and with other international organisations competent in the field of drugs and drug addiction, such as the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe.
These indicators underpin the EMCDDA’s reporting on trends and developments in the EU drug situation.
They are also used for the analysis of the coverage of responses or the assessment of the impact of policies and actions.
General population surveys and youth surveys
Prevalence and patterns of drug use among the general population are measured by probabilistic surveys of the adult and school population.
Data from general and school population drug surveys provide basic information to help to understand patterns of use, risk perceptions, social and health correlates, and consequences of use of illicit drugs and other psychoactive substances.
Problem drug use
This key indicator collects data on the prevalence and incidence of problem drug use (PDU) at national and local level.
Problem drug use is defined as ‘injecting drug use or long-duration/regular use of opioids, cocaine and/or amphetamines’.
As this population is hidden and difficult to access, this indicator builds on a range of indirect methods that use different existing data sets to extrapolate and produce an estimate of the number of problematic drug users.
The data sources employed to calculate the estimates differ in each country and are dependent on the routine information systems used in the country.
Treatment demand indicator
The treatment demand indicator is used to describe the population of drug users entering treatment each year and the number continuing in treatment from one year to the next.
The treatment demand indicator (TDI) consists of recommendations regarding method, definitions and items to be collected in relation to problem drug users presenting to drug treatment facilities.
These data are collected and collated nationally, and delivered annually.
Drug-related deaths and mortality among drug users
The aim of this indicator is to obtain statistics on the number and characteristics of people who die directly or indirectly as a consequence of drug use.
Drug-related mortality is a complex phenomenon, which accounts for a considerable percentage of deaths among young people in many countries.
This epidemiological indicator has two components: deaths directly caused by illegal drugs (drug-induced deaths) and mortality rates among problem drug users.
These two components can fulfil several public health and methodological objectives, notably as an indicator of the overall health impact of drug use and the components of this impact, identify particularly risky patterns of use, and potentially identify new risks.
Drug-related infectious diseases (DRID)
This key indicator collects data on the extent (incidence and prevalence) of drug-related infectious diseases — primarily HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B infection — in particular among people who inject drugs (injecting drug users or IDUs).
The data is collected on IDUs each calendar year using two main methods.
These are: (a) surveys of IDUs that include
According to the situation outside Europe, it may be necessary to collect data on other infectious diseases that are related directly or indirectly to drug use or drugs users, such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections.
Crime and markets
Other data are collected to complement the picture of the drugs situation from a law enforcement perspective, targeting drug-related crime and availability.
Drug-related crime
Based on international literature and evaluation practices, the definition of drug-related crime encompasses four categories:
• Psychopharmacological crimes: crimes committed under the influence of a psychoactive substance, as a result of its acute or chronic use.
• Economic-compulsive crimes: crimes committed in order to obtain money (or drugs) to support drug use.
• Systemic crimes: crimes committed within the functioning of illicit drug markets, as part of the business of drug supply, distribution and use.
• Drug law offences: crimes committed in violation of drug (and other related) legislation.
Availability of illicit drugs
Availability of drugs and drug markets are both major determinants and major consequences of drug use, particularly in terms of where and how they interact with the demand for drugs and with responses to the problem at local level.
Drug seizures can be as much an indicator of law enforcement activity in terms of supply reduction as they are of drug availability, but if cross-checked with qualitative information they may be a confirmation of drug flows.
Price and potency/purity of illicit drugs may both impact on the perceived availability of illicit drugs and reflect supply side factors (affecting access to drugs).
As such, they are considered as indirect indicators of drug availability.
• an ‘early-warning system’ to identify new drugs as they appear on the European market;
• a decision-making process (control measures) through which these products may be placed under control in the EU Member States.
The action on new drugs mechanism:
• is a unique tool combining public health and law enforcement institutions and information, with the aim to provide a multidisciplinary risk assessment;
• is governed by a specific instrument under the EU legal framework (a Council decision), which allows the measures applicable in the Member States for control of narcotic and psychotropic substances to be applied also to new psychoactive substances;
• control measures that may be decided by the Council are mandatory for the EU Member States.
Monitoring responses — Interventions, law and policies
Work in this area is structured around four main components (
): Best practice portal, demand reduction, interventions in the criminal justice system and national strategies, coordination mechanisms and legislation.
Best practice portal:
Responses — Interventions, law and policies.
Evidence of efficacy Tools for evaluation Standards and guidelines
Prevention Reduction of drug-related harm Drug treatment Social reintegration
Interventions in the criminal justice system:
Situation and assistance to drug users in prisons Alternatives to prison Prevention of drug-related crime
Policy and law:
National strategies, coordination mechanisms and legislation Public expenditure
(5) (6) http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/drug-situation/new-drugs For detailed information on the responses core data sets, see: http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/responses
Best practice portal
The EMCDDA has developed an online resource for professionals, policymakers and researchers in the areas of drug-related prevention, treatment, harm reduction and social reintegration.
The portal concentrates on illicit drugs and polydrug use and has a clear European focus.
Its main aim is to provide tools and standards to improve the quality of interventions and highlight examples of best practice across Europe.
Prevention
Since 1994, a new framework for classifying prevention into universal, selective and indicated prevention interventions replaces the previous concepts of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.
The guiding principle of this new classification is the target population by assumptions concerning its risk for substance abuse, but not the overall objective or content of a prevention intervention, as was the case previously.
Reduction of drug-related harm
Measures to minimise drug-related damage, reduce deaths and mitigate public nuisance are an integral part of many national drug strategies and a clear policy priority in a majority of countries.
The data collection in this area aims to improve the information basis on the level of implementation of evidence-based harm reduction measures by monitoring national strategies and responses, analysing available information and documenting evidence-based projects to support the transfer of expertise across Europe.
Drug treatment
Ensuring the availability of, and access to, targeted and diversified treatment and improving the quality of treatment are core to reducing drug demand.
The EMCDDA collects information through several treatment monitoring tools which aim to:
• address the policies and interventions Member States have established to provide evidence-based drug treatment.
More precisely, a specific tool is aimed at collecting data about the policies and organisational framework of drug treatment, as well as availability, accessibility and diversification of treatment;
• collect data through which the quality assurance measures that countries have taken to achieve and maintain a high quality of treatment service provision can be documented;
• collect quantitative data on the number of people reached by drug treatment in Member States, and more specifically the number of clients receiving substitution/maintenance treatment.
Social reintegration
The EMCDDA has developed a monitoring tool which addresses the policies and interventions that Member States have established to protect drug users from further exclusion and to improve their social inclusion.
It is aimed at collecting data to give an overview of availability, accessibility and diversification of interventions improving social inclusion and more particularly the employability of people in drug treatment.
Interventions in the criminal justice system
This area of work covers three issues:
• the situation and assistance to drug users in prisons;• law-enforcement measures as an alternative to prison for drug offenders, and;
• law-enforcement measures especially targeting statutory diversions addressed at young offenders, in order to avoid their progression into the criminal justice system.
National strategies, coordination mechanisms and legislation
Monitoring national and Community drug strategies and policies and their impact on the drug situation is a key EMCDDA activity. It has three main objectives:
• monitoring and describing policies, their framework and their relevant context;• contributing to policy analysis;• contributing to policy evaluation.
The specific topics covered include:
• EU drugs strategy (2005–12) and action plan (2009–12);• EU drug legislation;• national strategies/action plans on drugs;• national drug legislation;• coordination arrangements in the field of drugs;• public expenditure on drugs.
The Inter-American Observatory on Drugs (OID)
The Inter-American Observatory on Drugs (OID) is the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission’s (CICAD) statistical, information and scientific research branch.
The Observatory helps countries to improve the collection and analysis of drug-related data: by promoting the establishment of national observatories and the use of standardised
Drug use epidemiology in Latin America and the Caribbean
The primary drug use research system at the OID is the Inter-American Drug Use Data
) (SIDUC), an epidemiology-based system that comprises surveys on drug use for populations.
The SIDUC system applies standardised methodologies, in order to produce drug use data that are comparable across countries.
The objective of the system is to obtain timely, reliable and comparable data between countries.
This allows the OID to monitor the drug problem in the region based on a constellation of indicators:
• prevalence of substance use (lifetime, past year and past month) of illicit drugs and also alcohol and tobacco;
• incidence of substance use (past year and past month);
In order to meet this objective, the OID has developed a series of standardised questionnaires and methodologies to carry out drug use surveys in the following populations: secondary school students; university students; and general population (household).
In addition, the following research protocols to study the consequences of drug use have been developed or are currently under development: emergency rooms; treatment centres; and mortality associated with drug use.
Finally, three standardised protocols are available to study the relationship between drug use and crime in adult prisoners, juvenile offenders and arrestees.
In addition to quantitative research, the OID has carried out qualitative research studies on street children, and sex workers, among others.
It also works closely with several national governments in the Caribbean to establish solid information networks within the country.
These networks such as those in Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago integrate information from the many social sectors that participate in and contribute to the fight against drugs.
The OID’s Research and Development Programme
Epidemiological research forms the foundation the OID’s work in Latin America and the Caribbean, and is the sine qua non of any drug information system.
In order to develop robust drug information networks throughout the region, the OID’s initial focus is to build a
Building a national drugs observatory: a joint handbook solid epidemiology based network in each country, leading toward the development of trend data on drug use throughout the region.
To further support research and development, the OID developed the Latin American
Statistical Information
The OID’s statistical system for information on drug law enforcement information is the Inter-American Uniform Drug Supply Statistical System (CICDAT).
This system combines the collection of supply control data, complemented with cutting-edge, Internet-based software to compile statistics on seizures of drugs, chemical substances, weapons, equipment, vehicles, money and real estate, and on areas of cultivation and production, illicit drug laboratories discovered, as well as on persons arrested, tried, and convicted of drug trafficking, possession, and money-laundering crimes.
Drug Statistics Profiles by Country (
) is a new tool that draws on multiple sources to provide data on social and population factors, drug demand, and drug supply and drug control in the 34 Member States.
The OID programme estimates the human social and economic costs of drugs in the
The methodology is based on the ‘International Guidelines for Estimating the Costs of Drug Abuse’ (11); published by the Canadian Centre on Substance
Abuse and the World Health Organization (WHO), and is comprised of 17 indicators in four areas: healthcare, crime, labour productivity, and other costs.
To date, cost studies have been carried out in Argentina, Barbados, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay.
Colombia has also carried out a study on crime attributable to drug use through this programme.
These studies represent first studies of their kind in the region to quantify in economic terms the impact of the drug problem in these respective countries.
Strengthening drug observatories in Latin America and the Caribbean
The OID supports the development and establishment of drug observatories in the region.
To further this effort, the OID is embarking on a collaborative endeavor with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction to develop a methodological tool to
(2001), ‘The International Guidelines for Estimating the Costs of Drug Abuse’, The Canadian Centre on
Substance Abuse (CCSA).
Although local data collection may already exist, the process of establishing a national drugs observatory is usually linked to the need to provide sub-regional or international organisations with data on the national drugs situation.
Therefore, the first task is to transpose the reference framework for drug monitoring into a national one, summarising it and organising the different support and methodological tools it requires: general overview of information needed, short description for each area or topic to be covered including the list of indicators, together with their respective protocols.
This should be documented in a clear and concise manner for consideration by policymakers.
In many cases, an executive summary in national language(s) may be drafted to engage all possible stakeholders.
At this stage, there should be a summary document giving an overview of what can ideally be achieved within a few years.
International guidelines, data sets, specifications and protocols
These will vary according to geographical region: for the European Union, the Candidate and Potential Candidates to the EU, the reporting package is mandatory; countries that are members of CICAD–OAS use a different reference framework that is based on the mandate received from the OAS General Assembly Resolutions (12), and other countries report to the UN.
Reference manuals and handbooks
These exist for some specific protocols and methodologies and you will find some examples in the online toolbox at http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/joint/ndo-handbook

TIPS FOR NDO BUILDING
When adopting a national reference framework for reporting:
• Adapt the relevant international reference framework into a national one, taking into account the NDO’s mandate and translate it in the national language(s)
• Prepare an explanatory document presenting the NDO, its mandate, goals and objectives, the expected products/results (up to three pages)
• Prepare an executive summary of the national reference framework with a short description of information needed, and stress the benefi t it will bring nationally.
Why make a map?
Prior to setting up an NDO, drug-related information already exists in some form or another at national level.
However, a problem frequently encountered is that this information is not collected in a coordinated and systematic manner, which may be compounded when some of the actors involved do not work together.
The objective of the information map is therefore twofold:
Sources of information/databases
The NDO must first identify what information is already available by identifying and classifying existing sources of information, covering both demand and supply.
This ‘information map’ is not a one-off exercise, but a living document that should be constantly updated to reflect new needs for information, or new data sources.
Available sources of expertise
Data in relation to the complex drug phenomenon are of little value if not put into context and analysed.
To identify national experts and professionals who could contribute either to a better understanding or to a better reporting of the national situation is very important.
The information map exercise therefore allows you to do the following:
• make an inventory of data and information available;• establish a first contact with potential network members;• promote the project of establishing a national drugs observatory.
How to prepare the map?
At the start it can be difficult identifying who to contact and where to find them.
This is why a checklist is needed to identify areas, sectors and institutions to be contacted.
Once a group of institutions has been identified, a detailed search for persons and contact information can begin.
Such information is readily available nowadays, via the Internet or government directories.
These potential contacts are then included in the same checklist, in order to identify gaps and further investigation needed.
When contacts are followed up, some of the information will most probably need to be changed (wrong name or wrong department, new details, etc…), but it is very important to keep track of changes, as they are an important part of the information map’s memory.
Figure 2: Example of a checklist — drug-related infectious diseases
Checklist: 5 key epidemiological indicators:
University
Treatment centres
Public health institute
— General population surveys and youth surveys— Problem drug use— Treatment demand indicator— Drug-related deaths— Drug-related infectious diseases (DRID)
Drug-related infectious diseases
At this stage, before contacting people, it is useful to prepare a one page document presenting:
• the expected result of this inventory (= an information map, and a national working group).
Once the relevant contact people have been identified, this summary document should be sent to them, in order to prepare the first meeting.
To send such a summary document helps the persons and institutions involved: (1) understand and remember the purpose of the meeting; (2) prepare the information that may be useful for that purpose, and (3) explain to the other expert(s) that they will invite what is the objective and the context of the exercise.
It is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person (see the reference to the ‘elevator pitch’ in Chapter 6).
Indeed, at the start of the information map process, the objective is to initiate contact with persons identified before sending any explanatory document.
Surveys, feasibility studies, letters or e-mails are all good means of making a quick assessment, however, personal contact is essential to the success of any project.
People can facilitate or slow down the process, either because they find it interesting or because they feel threatened when sharing their data and possibly their responsibility.
Personal contact in order to build confidence and trust is therefore vital at this stage in the process.
Similarly, NDO key staff must meet contacts often, in order to identify and meet potential sources of expertise and (hopefully) future partners.
What should the information map contain?
The completed information map should be a summary of the situation regarding the availability of drug-related information, describing both technical details about data ownership, processing, software, storage, coverage, etc. as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the drug-related data available.
By ‘information’ or ‘drug-related data’, we mean any quantitative or qualitative information collected on a routine, recurrent or ad hoc basis, and which is linked to one or more aspects of the drugs phenomenon.
• name and/or description of data• type of data• provider: institution and address• contact person (full contact details)• purpose of the database/data collection system• statistical unit (e.g. person, test, offence) or specific topic covered and its definition• characteristics of the population covered• geographical coverage• institutional coverage• periodicity• source(s) of funding of data collection.
Once drafted, the first version of the information map should be sent to all stakeholders and contributors, together with a summary table highlighting available data and knowledge gaps, in order to: ask for feedback and checking; obtain agreement/consensus on the document, and; gain help in identifying potential complementary sources of information
) See template and guidelines for the information map in the online toolbox at http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/joint/ndo-handbook
Building a national drugs observatory: a joint handbook and/or expertise.
In principle, at this stage, the information gathered from partners should be accurate.
Some partners may be interested or reluctant to cooperate.
This point can be tackled when settingup the network.
At the end of this stage, the NDO and its stakeholders will all have a first overview of ‘where we are’ with the information map, which has to be compared with ‘where we want to be’ as presented in the drug monitoring reference framework.
Figure 3: Links between the information map and the national reference framework

Drug monitoring national referenceframework
Where we are
Information map
When launching the information map exercise:
(1) Identify key players (2) share your goals with them (3) organise a meeting to collect information
• Send an explanatory document so that your contacts can arrange meetings with potential sources of information and/or experts
• Arrange meetings with several experts/institutions representatives at once: this will help you gather more information and will help people to get to know each other
• If no face-to-face meeting is possible (size of country, budgetary constraints), use videoconference or another event (i.e. conference) attended by the experts/heads of institutions you wish to meet
• Send your contacts the key points from the meeting, for feedback and checking• Send them the fi nal version of the information map• Keep them informed about follow-up and results.
Why a national drug information system?
By ‘system’, we mean a structured organisation of heterogeneous sources of information that is needed to produce a comprehensive picture of the drug situation.
The system describes sources and flows of information requested by the national reference framework.
The elements of this system are not bound necessarily by hierarchical relations and its financing does not come from a single source of funding.
At this stage we should make two observations:
• as no comprehensive structure existed before the NDO, but some information is usually available within a country, the system must be built with the participation of information sources and other data providers that have been identified in the information map, which is done through the creation and development of a national network for drug information;
• the process of constructing the system must be documented and monitored: this is the role of the national action plan for the drug information system (NAPDIS — see p. 46).
The information map is a prerequisite to organising the national drug information system.
The next step is to imagine and propose a structure for data collection and reporting, which describes in detail the possible contribution expected from each stakeholder and existing gaps in the information available.
At this point, consulting and informing potential actors is vital, to ensure buy-in and support.
The proposal should include a clear description of work processes and communication channels.
A comprehensive national drug information system should have two main components: a national data collection network and a national drugs observatory:
• National data collection network: data collection usually occurs at different levels (national, local, county, municipality, etc.), covering diverse areas (supply or demand) and the work is carried out by various institutions, such as ministries, universities, research centres and NGOs;
• National drugs observatory: usually the budget of the NDO does not cover the cost of data collection, except in a few cases when data do not already exist and for which the NDO has a specific mandate and budget.
Therefore the costs for establishing and maintaining a drug information system do not require a totally new budget.
This is more a question of articulating and combining various sources of information and funding, to identify where the gaps are, and to look for potential complementary solutions.
Once the proposal for a national drug information system is ready, it has to be approved by the national authorities.
In some cases, cooperation protocols may need to be concluded between different institutions and the NDO.
This may also apply when experts from different institutions are going to take part in the work of the NDO, for instance for drafting the national report.
The next step of the process involves the preparation of a national action plan for the drug information system (NAPDIS), in which information is combined so as to identify objectives and actions to be undertaken.
The NAPDIS should give the guidelines for the work to be carried out over the years to come.
Depending on the type of data missing and the tools needed to collect them (routine data collection or special studies and surveys), different actors may need to intervene, and budgets may vary accordingly.
While the objectives define something to be reached in ideal conditions, some means and resources may be missing at the time of drafting the NAPDIS, and extra medium-term budget resources will not be guaranteed at this stage.
Therefore, what matters here is to identify and estimate for the concrete actions that will be launched as additional resources become available.
The NDO and partners will then be able to seek resources at a later stage.
The NAPDIS should also include three complementary tasks that are the responsibility of the national drugs observatory, according to its mandate and funding restrictions:
• Data collection: it is the responsibility of the NDO to identify gaps and needs for additional data collection exercises, and to convey this information to the national authorities.
According to available means, it may promote or even carry out new studies and surveys in order to bridge the knowledge gap.
The main aim is to ensure that any new survey or data collection exercise meets requirements and protocols presented in the national drug monitoring framework;
• Quality assurance: the NDO is expected to document and keep track of each data set included in the information map, and to propose measures and actions to be undertaken together with its partners for improving their quality and relevance.
For example, in the EU this can be carried out in the context of the national working groups that are often established for the implementation and development of each of the EMCDDA’s five key epidemiological indicators;
• Capacity development: the NDO should analyse together with its partners the needs for extra training on specific issues such as statistical analysis, sampling methods, implementation of standard protocols, quality control measures, and explore possible
This is also where the NDO can be instrumental in identifying extra funding opportunities from international organisations.
With the NAPDIS, the NDO and its partners identifies what needs to be done long-term in order to implement the drug monitoring reference framework, using the information map as a starting point.
However it is important to bear in mind that knowing ‘what needs to be done’ does not mean that everything can be done, or done at the same time: these are merely long-term goals.
Figure 4: Links between the information map, the NAPDIS and the national monitoring reference framework
Where we want to be
What needs to be done
National action plan for the drug information system (NAPDIS)
Once the NAPDIS is endorsed by its main stakeholders, then the NDO can prepare a yearly work programme.
In some countries, the two exercises (NAPDIS + annual work plan) are merged into a single document.
A NAPDIS gives the orientations and shows what needs to be done to develop the national drug monitoring system: it does not decide in advance what will be done or not, which in
1 4 many cases is not the NDO’s responsibility (
) Ultimately, the NDO cannot take responsibility for decisions that are out of its reach, but it can help influence relevant decisions.
To establish a national drug information system:
• (1) Prepare a proposal for a national drug information system, (2) get the national drug information system approved by national authorities, (3) prepare a national action plan (NAPDIS)
• Think about the concrete outputs and their relevance• Build a transparent system
• Partnership is all about networking and not a hierarchical or centralised process — but money and mandate can help!
• There may be other funding possibilities out there: have a clear idea of needs and costs• Be prepared to give short, simple and clear answers to questions regarding your activity/project.
Why establish a national network?
The main challenge for data providers in both the demand- and supply-reduction fields is to learn to work together and share information through networking with professionals from a range of areas, with different objectives, professional cultures and traditions.
Networking and establishing partnerships serve four purposes:
• Combining sources of information/data;• Pooling competences and analysis and reporting capacity;• Sharing limited resources;
• Establishing a basis for the improvement of data availability and quality, and for developing data analysis capacity.
The key principles underpinning this work are:
Equality of partners
All partners have the same rights and obligations, no pre-eminence of any one in particular.
Network = leadership + participative management
The relationship between the partners is non-hierarchical, but the network exists around a project which is coordinated under the leadership of the NDO.
It is the role of the NDO to keep the project on track, steering the collaborative process towards a common goal.
Respect of competences, authorship and ownership
Contributions by partners, especially in deliverables produced by the NDO, should be acknowledged; competences available in the network should be used and recognised.
It is important that NDO staff know their own limits and build on complementary expertise.
All authors and contributors should be credited in any reports published.
Look for mutual benefit in the cooperation
The mandate and role of the NDO cannot ensure the participation of relevant experts alone, nor guarantee that the NDO receives quality data.
Motivation and participation cannot be commanded; they are obtained through strong communication and clear mutual benefit.
Some existing or potential data providers are clinicians and professionals from the field whose main aim is not administrative work such as filling in and collecting questionnaires: they need to know why this is useful and they should see direct or indirect benefit for their efforts.
Communication is vital
A network lives because of the information exchange between its members.
For networks being established following the initiative or request of the NDO and/or the national authorities, the coordination role of the NDO should be two-way.
A network cannot operate and survive if it only serves the purpose of sending information to a central point once or twice per year: it is the NDO’s responsibility to animate the network, to make the partners aware of ongoing developments, and to assess how it can be made more useful for them (this point will be developed further in Chapter 6, under the heading Strategic diagnosis).
Example of a national drug information network
In country X, a national drug information network could combine institutions and resources such as:
• the Ministry of Health (data on drug users in treatment, data on drug-related infectious diseases)
• the Ministry of the Interior (data on seizures, price, quality, drug-related crime)
• the Inter-Ministerial Drug Committee (funding of NDO staff who coordinate the production of the national report and who ensure national reporting obligations are met)
• two universities, with two PhD students undertaking research — one on sero-prevalence in hidden populations, the other on drugs users in prison — with some additional funds from WHO or another international organisation
• the World Bank or another international donor (a general population survey and electronic data collection system on drugs users in treatment)
• other national organisations for some ad hoc surveys and/or qualitative studies among drug users• laboratories for the identification of new drugs and their consequences• the national drugs observatory in its role of coordinator of the whole network.
How to network?
When possible, on the basis of the experts and institutions identified during the information map exercise, establish a national working group for each set of indicators and core data and for national reporting.
Encourage and help these groups to define achievable objectives with the existing resources in order to ensure a (better) monitoring of the drugs situation in your country.
Provide all national working groups with regular information about the activities and achievements of the other groups.
Organise a national meeting every year or every two years where you present and discuss with them the national report and the data reported.
Identify with them needs for improvements, perspectives for new or better data collection and any other ad hoc studies, and act as a facilitator for accessing information on possible sources of funding.
Conventions or agreements can help to formalise cooperation, but cannot replace partner motivation.
This is one of the network’s critical roles (see Figure 5): it can help answer the question ‘how are we going to get where we want to be?’.
Basically, the network helps to define and then translate the NAPDIS into reality.

How to get there
What needs to be done
Information map
When creating a national drug information network:
• Present the missions of the NDO and the national drug information network: the ultimate goal is to meet national reporting obligations
• Respect your partners and highlight their work• Make sure you are able to keep your promises• Think about their benefi t or their areas of interest• Ensure that all contributors receive credit for their work• It takes a lot of time to build trust…but it can be quickly lost forever!• Consult partners, ask for feedback and get them to check NDO publications• Involve them in follow-up activities
• Try to be useful to them (e.g. provide information on potential sources of funding, grant applications to international organisations, relevant international conferences)
• Try to arrange a meeting every 1–2 years with your partners to share information, discuss the conclusions of your reports, and reflect about current trends.
In the European Union, best practice suggests having national working groups for fi ve key epidemiological indicators, national reporting and law enforcement indicators, when possible.
Quality of the data (
Quality assurance should be an integral part of a national action plan for a drugs information network, as long as it is realistic and takes into account available resources.
Quality assurance is achieved by identifying what ‘quality’ means in context; specifying methods by which its presence can be ensured; specifying ways in which it can be measured to ensure conformance.
Quality control means checking quality of the data against a set standard or specification. cation.
Ensuring quality is a big challenge for an NDO and may be attained by organising or facilitating training activities for NDO staff and partners, and by defining a clear quality assurance process.
The NDO has a key role in raising awareness on this issue with partners and driving a consensus on concrete steps to take in order to improve the quality of data collected.
) Quality assurance is an organisation’s guarantee that the product or service it offers meets the accepted quality standards.
The NDO’s networking strategy may also help motivate data providers to deliver quality data and further address the issue of quality as part of the data collection process.
How can you control and improve data quality?
Improving the quality of information on drug-related issues following an initial identification of potential problems or shortcomings may be achieved by establishing new sources of information, or capacity building.
In this task, the NDO may choose to use methodological materials available from specialised
16 organisations, such as the EMCDDA, WHO, UNODC and others (
Following this process, provide your partners with a fi nal report, summarising the strengths and weaknesses of data quality, along with recommendations for changes and/or improvements.
TIPS FOR NDO BUILDING (
When developing quality assurance:
• Participate in working groups and other networking events
• Liaise with and/or take part in relevant international or regional expert meetings and subprojects on this issue
• Carry out a formal review of data quality and availability at national level with an expert panel• Compare results with international guidelines and standards
• Foster cooperation through smaller projects that are less ambitious and with more chances of success
Remember that any progress in this area will depend on your capacity to build consensus!

How to analyse the information collected?
The objective of this core function is to interpret and present heterogeneous data combining quantitative and qualitative information in order to give a comprehensive picture of the drugs situation.
This critical process should entail the following:
• working with quantitative data;• analysing qualitative information;• interpreting and putting together all sources of information.
This section will give an overview of the main criteria to be taken into account when checking and analysing quantitative data provided to the NDO, giving concrete examples when relevant.
More detailed information about statistical methods and about the specific protocols for data
1 collection can be found on the handbook’s online toolbox (
Before discussing this issue, we must stress that in many cases the data being used by the NDO for its monitoring and reporting functions are ‘secondary data’, i.e. data collected and analysed by some institutions and/or organisations for other purposes.
Although the NDO may also be involved directly or indirectly in some data collection exercises as supervisors, this ‘second hand data’ means that the NDO must be able to rely upon staff with substantial expertise in handling and analysing data and statistics.
It is also important that staff keep a record of all of the information related to the data used for any reporting.
Common sources of quantitative drug data
Government records and registries
Government records broadly cover any kind of quantitative data that are officially collected at the State level, ranging from national health and economic statistics to more specific statistics such as those related to crime or treatment records.
In most cases, these data are routinely collected.
Such data and statistics usually provide information on all recorded cases in the country — for example fatal emergencies that occurred in a given period — and are therefore considered as an entire statistical population (in opposition to surveys that study a sample of a reference population).
When it comes to monitoring the drugs situation as implemented in the European Union by the EMCDDA, this will cover for instance the quantitative data collected on drug-related deaths (through general mortality registers and special drug-related deaths registers), on drug users in treatment (through drug treatment reporting systems), and on drug-related infectious diseases (through the infectious disease surveillance system).
By extension, data collected systematically in the area of law enforcement such as drug-related arrests and seizures or court decisions record for instance, are also covered by this definition (for more details, see Chapter 3, section ‘Adopting international reference tools’).
Surveys
Another important category of data collected by national drugs observatories will come from surveys organised either periodically or on ad hoc basis.
The studies can be implemented either by or with financial support from government institutions, international agencies and organisations, universities, private organisations or by the national drugs observatory itself.
It is important to assess whether such studies are using international standardised protocols and methodologies.
Ad hoc studies can be surveys among specific groups of the population who are at high-risk of drug use (such as homeless people and prisoners) or surveys on drug-related infectious diseases, for instance.
A survey is used to describe a situation in a population at a given point in time.
Data collected in the area of ‘responses to the drug problem’ may also fall within this group.
Time series studies represent a special case and are a very interesting source of information.
They exist essentially in two areas:
• cohort studies (treatment cohorts, birth cohorts, special cohorts);• repeated cross-sectional series e.g. school surveys.
Indirect estimation methods
While the data collected through surveys or through government records allow for some kind of measurement, there are some areas or some aspects of the drugs situation that cannot be directly measured.
This is especially the case when trying to know the number of problematic or ’high-risk’ drug users in a country: within this ‘hidden’ population, only some are in contact with the services of the State, mostly through the health or justice systems.
Importance of statistical metadata
What are metadata?
‘Metadata provides information on data — and about processes of producing and using data.
2 inform about’ (
Metadata give us insight as to how data were collected, what they describe and refer to, and about the reliability and comparability of the information provided.
Metadata can help answer questions such as:
• What kind of study are we talking about: is it part of routine data collection?
Is this study part of other sets of studies that are being compared, or is it a one-off study?
If data are routinely collected, what is their origin, how is the data collection organised?
• Are data coming from (a) recognised government bodies, or (b) private/voluntary organisations, (c) universities and research centres?
If (b), is there a system in place in the country for authorising and supervising these services (e.g. NGOs providing some kind of treatment without any certification provided by the national authorities)?
‘Guidelines for the Modelling of Statistical Data and Metadata’, United Nations Statistical Commission and Economic Commission for Europe, United Nations, Geneva 1995.
• Are the sources using standardised and systematic data collection procedures, or are the data collected serving other objectives (e.g. treatment follow-up vs police operations)?
• Do the sources have an official appraisal system for data quality assurance, have there been recent reviews of the procedures and quality, and are there formal reviews of data quality?
Are these formal reviews available at national level?
What do the data sources usually do to assess their own quality, how do they consider their figures?
Were the studies or data published in a scientific journal or peer reviewed?
Metadata are as important as the data themselves, and should be stored and kept updated by the national drugs observatory, under what is sometimes called the ‘statistical metadata system’.
How to assess quantitative data
We will briefly describe here four groups of criteria for the assessment of quantitative information: definitions, representativeness, validity and reliability.
A definition is a brief precise statement of what a word, question, measure or expression means.
In order to understand the individual study and to know how to combine the data collected or received, the NDO needs to assess whether there are clear, valid and common definitions being adopted, and how these are being implemented.
The following questions may guide the NDO in this task:
• Are there standard definitions and are they uniformly applied geographically and temporally in the country?
• Is there any reference document presenting and explaining the case definitions and was there any training or follow-up ensured so as to make sure that these are used in the same way everywhere?
• Are the reported measurements clear and precise (for instance not just ‘used cannabis’ but ‘used cannabis 40+ times in lifetime’)?
• Is the period used to describe the prevalence consistent with standard protocols, and are the age groups defined in line with international standards?
The conclusions need to be documented and included in the NDO’s data register.
When the NDO identifies problems on compatibility of definitions and their application with international standards and protocols, it should explore with the data providers the reasons for these discrepancies and try to find solutions.
Representativeness
A primary consideration for the NDO is whether the data collected is representative of the target population.
In relation to government statistics and registries, the issue is whether the registries cover the entire target population.
Where sampling has been employed, the method of sampling can determine whether the sample is representative of the target population, or some subset (3).
) that may help the NDO further investigate the representativeness of the data it received. For a more in-depth assessment, the NDO should either have a statistician working full-time, or it should rely on the services of a statistician working in a university or in a public health institute, for example.
Geographical coverage
Is the national coverage real or does it cover all regions but only to some extent?
Is there information on local areas: city sizes, catchment areas, areas not covered, and can the geographic coverage provide subnational breakdowns?
Is the sampling representative only at national level or does it meet the criteria for subnational areas?
Population coverage
Do data cover the whole population or only partially (e.g. certain age groups, people in treatment or people admitted to hospital, prisoners, employed people, those who can afford treatment)?
Are there known demographic peculiarities present in the data source (e.g. minority groups)?
Are there any breakdown preferences (e.g. some age groups or gender), is there any oversampling of a given subgroup of the population in order to allow a more in-depth analysis of their situation?
Changes in coverage
Do changes in coverage occur?
Why?
Is this due to the fact that participating agencies extended/changed, because of changes in the legal requirements or because case definitions were extended (deaths registers, postmortem procedures, changed International Classification of Diseases coding practices)?
Golbeck, A. L., ‘Evaluating statistical validity of research reports: a guide for managers, planners and researchers’, United States Department of Agriculture, Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, General Technical Report PSW-87, May 1986.Inspired form a presentation by Dr Colin Taylor, ‘Assessing data quality’, Reitox academy specialised course, Thessaloniki, June 2004 (unpublished).
Additional comments on sampling
The most common distinction between sampling methods is that between probabilistic (simple random sampling, stratified random sampling …or some mixture thereof) and nonprobabilistic methods (purposive sampling, snowball sampling …).
Central to which probabilistic sampling method is employed is the availability or not of a coherent sample frame, or listing of the target population.
Probabilistic methods, correctly implemented, allow generalisations to be made to the population listed in the sample frame, with statements of sampling error in the form of confidence intervals.
Nonprobabilistic sampling is used when a researcher wants to explore an experience, investigate a phenomenon or develop a new theory.
Such sampling is associated with qualitative sampling and is interested in saturation (describes the complete experience or phenomenon) rather than generalisability (ensuring that the findings represent the population from which the sample was drawn).
If in principle the study findings are to be generalisable, it is necessary to ensure that the sample is representative.
This implies that it is important for the NDO to have access not just to the numbers generated but also to information on the sampling method used and implementation of the survey.
Validity
How can the validity of a study be assessed?
When a study measures what it intended to measure it is valid.
Different disciplines may make reference to different types of validity, however with quantitative studies, what is important to ensure is that:
• the measure is relevant to the study population;• the measure is relevant to the experts in the subject;
• the attitude assessment of the survey population can predict or agree with constructs external to attitude;
• the answers correlate with other related constructs in the anticipated manner.
Standard methodology texts can be referred to for definitions (
Of particular interest to the NDO are questions such as whether there are any bibliographic references related to the validity of the tools used for the study and if ‘yes’, is the bibliography consistent with the use made of the tool in the study?
Are there any associated
See for example Carmines, E. G. and Zeller, R. A. (1979), ‘Reliability and Validity Assessment’, Sage Publications, London.
While assessing the validity of the studies or surveys, special attention must be paid to possible biases, or non-random or systematic errors, entering into the data.
Sources of bias may include sampling methods, question wording, and interview techniques.
Bias in data collection
This criterion relates to technical issues that may arise and that may have an impact on the study and bias the results.
For that purpose, please check:
• what was foreseen in case of non-response: possible bias and assumptions if ignored
• what checks were done on non-respondents?
Was there any decision taken by the interviewers that may influence or affect the sampling method?
Analysis methods
Complementary information should be available regarding:
• description of the analysis if appropriate;• description of the statistical or qualitative software that was used.
Do the authors use recognised and known scales?
How is their validity and consistency evaluated?
How were the interviewers recruited?
What was the relationship between interviewer and respondent (formal, official, friend, student, private market research).
Who was present at the interview or during the questionnaire, and what was their status (parent, school-teacher, prescribing doctor, professional, or policeman)?
Length, self-completion and confidentiality.
How is confidentiality guaranteed, and what are the chances that it is perceived as guaranteed?
Indicators are approximate and often imperfect measures of the nature and extent of particular drug use-related events or outcomes.
There is a need to systematically check the quality of data sources as a prerequisite for their selection within a system.
Quantity of data sources used does not in itself provide a more valid system.
Data sources reflect different aspects of the phenomenon.
When analysing routine quantitative datasets check:
• What is the source of the data?• Is there an inventory of drug-related services?• Are all drug-related services recruited?• What is the coverage geographically?• What is the reporting participation level?• Is there a unique identifi er?• What is/are the case defi nition(s)?• Have they been published or do they have internal protocols?• Do the national protocols follow any international protocols and if yes, which ones?• Is there a recognised appraisal system?• Have there been any recent changes to the protocol or data collection process?• Has the data been checked for logical error?
When reading or designing a quantitative study, ask yourself and if needed check with your partners:
• What type of study is it (surveillance system, prevalence survey, longitudinal study, cohort study, case series, case control study, randomised control trial)?• Is the study national, regional or local?• Is the study a one-off or part of a series?• What are you measuring?• Is a quantitative study appropriate?• Is the study design appropriate?• Who is the target population and what are the inclusion and exclusion criteria?• What is the sample size and sampling methods?• What was the response rate?• Is the study generalisable to the original population and how is this measured?• Are the measures valid, reliable and comparable?
Ask for a copy of the questionnaire and details of other means of measurement.• Is the statistical analysis appropriate?• Is there ethical approval?• If a prevalence survey, is the data weighted and do the proportions have confi dence intervals?• If another type of study, determine if the method of analysis is appropriate.• What are the limitations of the study?• Who authored and who reviewed the study?• Who published the study: peer reviewed journal, research institution or other?• If in doubt, seek expert advice, for instance university, Public Health Institute, research institute or your data provider(s).

Statistical analysis
As already stated, the data provided to the NDO are often secondary.
This aggregated data makes direct statistical analysis impossible.
This can, of course, limit the NDO’s ability to make statistical comparisons between different groups or samples.
Analysing and interpreting quantitative data require a sound knowledge of statistical analysis and of the most commonly used statistical software.
The NDO is expected to use its statistical knowledge to assess the conclusions of the reports and surveys that it has received, and/or to conduct or contribute to the statistical analysis of primary data.
When the NDO does not have a specialist in statistics on its regular staff, a cooperation agreement with a university or with a scientific research institution (for example an institute of public health or the national institute for statistics) should be established.
As the production and collection of quantitative data lies at the heart of the NDO’s work and the national drug information network, it is vital to make sure that the data presented meet the highest possible quality criteria.
Scientific objectivity and independence are essential conditions for the legitimacy and credibility of the work of the NDO and its partners — any compromise would undermine the viability of the whole system.
Qualitative data: putting data into context
How to analyse qualitative information?
How to make a correct interpretation?
Qualitative data used by an NDO usually originate from two different sources: contextual information from key informants and formal qualitative research studies.
Contextual information from key informants on the drugs situation includes such issues as current or new patterns of behaviour of substance use, guidelines and standards for treatment, evolution and evaluation of prevention programmes, national strategies and coordination mechanisms, to mention just a few.
Such wide-ranging information requires more flexible tools and periodicity for collection than is the case for quantitative data.
For instance, it can be collected by using structured or semi-structured questionnaires.
This data can take the form of expert surveys, identifying and requesting information for those in the field with direct experience of the topic of interest.
Qualitative research gives us an opportunity to make sense of quantitative information, by further exploring:
• the social context;• the social meaning of behaviour, and;• behaviour as part of a wider social dynamic.
Within the arena of drug use, qualitative research has proved to be essential for:
• interpreting statistical data and placing it in context;• providing insight into the problems and needs associated with a range of drug-using patterns;• assessing the context in which interventions may be more effective; and• helping to evaluate the drug users experience of interventions;• understanding new drug using phenomena;• providing insight into drugs markets.
The NDO plays an important role in making an inventory of such research results in its country, and in integrating these results in its analysis and reports.
It can also identify the areas where additional qualitative research is needed, and launch a joint project with its partners if resources are available.
NDOs frequently face a situation in which they receive some limited quantitative information that is not sufficient per se to draw a clear and correct conclusion.
In such circumstances, a combination of both quantitative and qualitative information can help them to build a more accurate or more comprehensive picture of the situation concerned.
While putting data into context, look for complementary information, for instance:
• Content and objectives of demand-reduction activities• Patterns of drug use• Scientifi c evidence for such activities• Links with quantitative data describing the situation that the activity is targeting• Placement of demand-reduction activities within broader public health strategy• Evaluation and assessment reports• Methodological standards and guidelines.

How to assess the quality of qualitative studies
Qualitative research is characterised by a wide range of approaches and data collection techniques, and determining how to judge the quality of a qualitative study will depend on the approach adopted.
Efforts have been made to develop criteria within qualitative research which are accepted broadly as replacements for what quantitative researchers call validity and reliability.
The strength of qualitative research is that it addresses the relationship between the researcher and the research object, precluding the notion of a common truth.
However, there are a few common aspects that should be considered:
• Did the authors define a clearly formulated statement of the objectives of the research and what specific question it addressed?
• Was a qualitative approach appropriate?
• How were the settings and the subjects selected?
Generally, qualitative studies are not interested in an ‘average’ — they gain an understanding of the experience of particular groups or individuals.
For example, a qualitative study on drug using women from ethnic minorities giving birth in hospital with the aim to provide guidelines to hospitals may purposively choose women who use drugs with different birth experiences.
In any case, we need to understand how the sample was selected in order to understand the results and in order to draw conclusions.
• What methods were used and are these described in detail?
Describing methods is not an easy task in qualitative research but you should be able to assess whether the methods were a sensible and adequate way of addressing the research question.
• What methods were used to analyse the data?
There are a broad range of qualitative methods, each with their own specific methodological perspective.
• Was attention given to the reliability of inter-observers and to the validity of findings?
For example, were the streetworkers involved in the interviews given training or a handbook?
• Are the results credible?
What conclusions were drawn and are they justified by the results?
Do the results meet expectations or are they contradictory:
• — with other parts of the study;• — with the results of other studies performed in the same environment?
When the information is based on key informants, the following issues deserve careful attention:
• What was the key informant’s perspective?
The information from key informants is never unbiased; it is influenced by their position, their personal, political, or cultural interests: what is their motivation?
• Was there more than one key informant chosen (i.e. expert panel)?
How were they selected?
• Key informants should be encouraged to disclose any specific interests that might influence their impartiality.
When considering a qualitative study…
• What are the study objectives?
• What type of study is it (simple thematic analysis, action research, grounded theory, phenomenology, ethnography or other)?
• Does the author(s) reveal his/her view point(s) and discuss how his/her view point(s) may affect the study?
• Who authored and who reviewed the study?
• Who published the study? Peer review journal, research institution or other?
When using information provided by key informants…
• What is the perspective and motivation of the key informants?• How were key informants selected?
Analyses of trends in the wider context
‘A trend is the slow variation over a longer period of time, usually several years, generally associated with the structural causes affecting the phenomenon being measured. It is the variation left after time series analysis has removed accidental (irregular or random),
6 working-day and seasonal variation from a time series (
The most frequent mistake encountered in reports is the use of the term ‘trend’ to characterise the difference between data collected in two different periods of time: this is not acceptable from a methodological perspective and can lead to a biased interpretation of the real situation.
The social, demographic, economical or political context may be used to explain related indicator data and/or trends.
Some examples are:
• socio-demographic characteristics (i.e. unemployment rate);
• developments in the music culture (increase in popularity of music cultures that are associated with drug consumption);
• public health expenditure and priorities (public expenditure or changes in the number of treatment units);
• social exclusion/poverty;
• immigration/ethnicity (i.e. emergence of new drug use patterns among immigrants that may affect local supply);
• tourism (i.e. emergence of new drugs on the local market due to demand among tourists).
It would again be ideal if the associations between variables were investigated in specific research studies focusing on the strength of the association between variables in a specific data set (e.g. a study investigating the association between socio-economic marginality and health services utilisation among a sample of 120 heroin users attending an outpatient clinic in South London).
Such studies can be used as additional sources of information, keeping in mind that the results cannot simply be transferred to other populations.
When there are no formal studies investigating these associations, the results of qualitative studies and information sources such as key informants (i.e. professionals working in the treatment centres) may suggest potentially relevant influences which can be mentioned in the data discussion.
It should however be remembered that, in the absence of more complete statistical analysis and without established statistical significant associations, only assumptions are made and it is crucial that these assumptions are plausible and are clearly presented as assumptions.
Analyses of trends: errors, threats, and risk
Reliability and validity challenges for drug trend monitoring systems or potential for error, lie in two broad areas: at the level of individual sources and at the whole system level.
A type 1 error means finding something that is not there would involve identifying a trend that does not exist.
A type 2 error — missing something that is there — would involve a system failing to identify a new drug trend (7).
Identification of a nonexistent trend (type 1 error or false positives): Type 1 errors can be linked to data collection, analysis or reporting errors.
This might result from using too few or poor quality data sources; an over reliance on sensitive data sources which are not sufficiently validated by routine data; a failure to adjust for seasonal consumption patterns; over generalising findings to wider populations on the basis of a small sample or weak evidence; and reporting too quickly, in doing so incorrectly naming a pattern or tendency, a ’trend.’
Creating a new trend is the ultimate risk here.
Failing to identify a trend (type 2 error or false negatives): Type 2 errors, or failing to identify and report a new trend might be the result of poor data choice, or poor analysis techniques.
For example an over reliance on slow reporting methods is likely to lead to late reporting of a trend.
There is a specific risk that systems will miss emerging drug trends by not asking appropriate research questions.
There are a range of forms this might take, from limiting the number of substances that are monitored, perhaps over focusing on groups of known users rather than keeping a sentinel function at the trendsetting edges — as was the case with ecstasy users in the 1980s (8).
Slow developing trends are vulnerable here — very slight but continuous increases or decreases in consumption might never reach the reporting threshold, but in the longer term do constitute a significant change.
Analyses of the relationship between different indicators
The purpose of cross-referencing other data is to see whether certain trends or observations are linked to or confirmed by trends/observations seen in other indicators (e.g. an increase in the number of cocaine users seeking treatment coincides with an increase in the number of cocaine related arrests during the same time span and geographical coverage).
As mentioned before, an appraisal of the data quality for the indicators is of crucial importance.
The cross-references made in the national report are there to present possible relationships between indicators taking into account other influences and biases.

Mixed methods
A number of researchers have argued in favour of the use of mixed methods for drug trend
If it is accepted that all methods have their blind spots, it has been argued that mixed method approaches help construct a more three-dimensional and reliable picture of the phenomenon and are likely to produce judgement of greater validity.
Mixed method research is underpinned by the principle of triangulation — based on the avoidance of overreliance on a single research method and thus by employing several approaches aiming to enhance confidence in findings.
Mixed methods sampling strategies involve the selection of units for a research study using both probability sampling (to increase external validity) and purposive sampling strategies (to increase transferability).
Use of mixed methods requires attendance to bias checking procedures for each method.
Writers on mixed method approaches advocate for the use of validity procedures for both qualitative and quantitative phases of the study e.g., check potential threats to internal validity for surveys and check accuracy of qualitative findings through member checking,

Reporting and communicating should be seen as a critical function of the national drugs observatory, even if they are the result of a long process.
Ultimately, producing and disseminating outputs underpin the NDO’s existence, as its outputs substantiate its visibility both nationally and internationally.
To ensure sustainability and ‘buy-in’, it is vital that the NDO ensures that it is perceived to be providing added value by its stakeholders and audiences — both at national and supranational level.
In the long run, a failure to build visibility and to demonstrate the added value of the NDO will automatically have a negative impact on its credibility.
In other words, the drug information network must show that it has not been created for the sake of the network itself (which would raise the question ‘apart from observing, what are you doing?’), but for the intrinsic value of the data it delivers, and for the decisions and actions that can be taken by its clients on the basis of the information it provides.
What should NDO outputs contain?
The objective is to use the results of data analysis and interpretation to answer stakeholder questions.
This means that reports must be tailored in terms of content and format to the needs of the NDO’s stakeholders, or ‘clients’.
To reach this objective, the NDO needs to:
• make the added value of its outputs a priority;
• know its stakeholders and assess their needs;
• go beyond the sole description of the past or present situation;
• comply with international reporting procedures;
• develop a strategy for communication and dissemination.
How to report at national level?
This is one aspect of the NDO’s reporting that may sometimes be underestimated, for instance when the focus of its work, or of its mandate, is to meet national reporting obligations of supranational or international organisations.
Even if the latter is the starting point for the establishment of the NDO, this is not enough to guarantee the participation and motivation of the data providers, nor to secure national funding from decisionmakers on a long-term basis.
The reporting activity should be oriented towards the ‘clients’ or stakeholders: the content and the structure of the report or output, its format, its language and its level of detail are closely linked to those who will read it.
This means that ideally, for each output being produced, the NDO should define its objective, identify the target group, and select the relevant format.
The drafting process can only start after this preliminary analysis.
The challenge for the NDO is to provide answers to information needs and to ensure that customers are satisfied.
This is no easy task.
Information may be either complementary or divergent; for example, there may be a trade-off when balancing national needs and international reporting obligations.
Moreover, information needs may also be unclear or unknown.
It is difficult, for example, to assess ex ante the information needs of customers of public services.
Instead, it should be possible to use participative techniques such as focus groups with subgroups of end-users to assess in detail the relevance of specific outputs.
The danger for the NDO would be to decide without consultation what its audience needs, both in terms of content and of format.
It needs to ask those concerned what their needs are.
However, the NDO does have a role to propose outputs and issues that may be of interest to the community: it must be proactive.
Objections may be raised that it is not within the NDO’s mandate to make such proposals, nor to take initiatives.
The reality is slightly different: although the NDO is not expected to make recommendations for national policy, it is perfectly within its information role to present authorities with an accurate analysis of the last trends in drugs use in the country, and to inform them about the implications of these findings.
When planning outputs and publications, the work of the NDO and its partners should combine:
• An assessment of the information needs of its stakeholders at national level, through regular dialogue with its direct ‘clients’, for instance by asking their feedback about their products
• A contribution to building common understanding of the national drugs situation between experts and for stakeholders.
To whom should we report at national level?
What for?
For the purpose of this handbook, by ‘stakeholder’ we mean ‘a person, group, or organisation that has direct or indirect stake in a business organisation because it can affect or be affected by the organisation’s actions, objectives, and policies. (…) Although stake-holding is usually selflegitimising (those who judge themselves to be stakeholders are de facto so), all stakeholders are not equal and different stakeholders are entitled to different considerations (1)’.
The NDO’s potential stakeholders and potential clients are decision-makers, professionals working in the drugs field, the scientifi c community and the general public.
Together they must be considered as customers for the NDO’s outputs.
Some of them may also be the decision-making authority for the NDO’s financing and/or management, and they may therefore have additional expectations (for instance the Ministry that is financing the NDO may expect to receive a well-documented report of activities that justifies the award of a subsidy).
Once the stakeholders have been identified, it is necessary for the NDO to make a first assessment of what could be their needs, how they could be met, and what are the resources/partnerships needed.
We would suggest the NDO classifies stakeholders in the following order of importance (
Decisionmakers
Decision-makers, and more generally those who are sponsoring the NDO either directly or indirectly; government and parliament representatives; drug coordinators and officials responsible for implementing drug policy; local government officials. cials.
Importance
Their decision has an impact on the existence of the national drugs observatory and on the investment in the national drugs information network.
They need highly summarised, objective information on the national drugs situation in an international context and on drugs-related issues of national interest.
More detailed information should be available upon request.
Type of output needed
Clear, short and simple information, always in the national language(s) and sometimes provided at short notice.
Professionals working in the drugs field: treatment centres; prevention and educational specialists; outreach workers, but also law enforcement professionals.
They are the NDO’s key partners and data providers; they need to be motivated for maintaining or even increasing their contribution, and they should gain some benefit for their efforts.
Their potential needs cover a broad range of information: external sources of funding for training and training materials, grants, etc.; national drugs situation in an international context; international standards and methodological tools in their respective field of activity.
The information should be clear, with a level of detail that can be taken on board in their own practice, and provided in the national language(s).
Two additional groups could also be added to the list of stakeholders, although they are usually not the primary target for the NDO’s communication and dissemination strategy.
However, it might be considered useful if the NDO could utilise information or data already produced for other purposes for the benefit of these two groups;
Researchers
These are researchers in the drugs field: university researchers and scientific staff; research institutes; field researchers in NGOs.
Their work represents a significant part of the information being produced at national level, either to illustrate the issue or to understand the rationale behind behaviours and attitudes.
An NDO contribution to their work could either be in the form of providing information or contributing to the dissemination of their research results.
This group needs very detailed information, if not raw data, so as to develop their scientific work: scientific reports and analyses; statistical data at national and international level; scientific literature on new topics; and sometimes access to scientific publications and summaries.
The information should be comprehensive, very detailed and easily accessible.
General public
This covers in particular those directly or indirectly confronted with the drugs issue: students, young people, drug users and their families.
Making clear and understandable information available to the general public is part of their fundamental rights: it is also an obligation for organisations that are being established with public money.
Citizens basically need answers to key questions such as: what should I think about the drugs situation in the country and its danger and what should I do to prevent or to deal with the problem?
Is it serious?
Is my child going to be affected?
Where can I go for help?
The information should be clear, concise, presented in simple terms, avoid sensationalism and provide citizens with concrete solutions for seeking help or advice in their own language.
The matrix that follows (Figure 6) can be used to make a first approximation of the needs of the stakeholders, with reference to two criteria: format — the level of detail of the information to be provided, from low (a few pages) to high (represented by all data sets and raw figures), and; content — addressing specific issues or providing general information on the situation.
Figure 6: Matrix of information needs showing content and format
Format, level of detail
General
Following such analysis, the national drugs observatory can then assess:
• the appearance and nature of NDO products and deliverables needed at national level, and
• how to use and format the results of data analysis and interpretation to match the needs of its different users.
The same approach can be used at the end of the process, to check if the fi nal product matches the format and content needs identified in the matrix.
Know your national stakeholders and assess their needs:
Summarised information on specific issues, topics of interest: e.g. policy briefings, executive summary of national reports.
Professionals from the drugs fi eld
Information covering a wide range of technical and methodological issues, structured and well documented contents, in a not-too-detailed format (for instance, review of literature, analysis of a compilation of documents).
Very detailed information, including raw data, on specific topics, allowing them to make their own analysis and interpretation.
Summarised information on topics of general interest, allowing the audience to gain some insight into changes in the drugs situation and above all about the responses that may be relevant to their needs.
Why differentiate between analysis and reporting?
Are they not part of the same process?
Within the limits of its mandate, the NDO needs to explore how it can make its work and products more useful and more relevant for its national audience.
There are two complementary ways to achieve this — by going beyond a simple descriptive reporting approach, and by tailoring the products to audience needs.
Producing a report that goes beyond a simple description of the situation can be done either by being proactive or by using the information available in a more creative manner:
• proactive approach: using the knowledge on the current situation, try to anticipate future developments and possible consequences, e.g. ‘given the evolution of the drugs situation, what could be the new needs for treatment or for prevention in a few years time, and how could we inform professionals and decisionmakers about this?’
• creative use of available information involves seeing how one can use of the information available in an innovative manner, for audiences who are unaware of the NDO’s existence and its work, e.g. ‘for the first time in this country, we have made an extensive study on illicit drug use in the general population in cooperation with an international organisation.
How can we present the results to our national authorities in a way that appeals to them?’
In the first approach, additional information identified by the NDO may be needed, which may mean deciding how to obtain or produce the missing information.
This will then become a new project for the NDO and its partners.
A complementary approach can be to correlate the information on the national situation together with the situation at regional or international level.
This is also where the international dimension of the NDO’S work can be useful, as it puts the NDO in a position of bringing to national stakeholders critical information that was produced in other countries and validated by international organisations.
When the NDO produces reports and other outputs, it should always be able to answer the ‘…so what?’ question.
Often reports are not written with the reader in mind: they are too long, too detailed or too descriptive, without a clear conclusion to enable the reader to come to his or her own opinion on the situation that is being presented.
This leaves the reader asking ‘so what?’
Therefore while mapping the needs (perceived or not) of the national audience, both in terms of content, format and timeliness, it is essential to keep in mind that clients or stakeholders must be able to make direct use of the products that have been produced with them in mind.
Every time the answer to the ‘so what?’ question is not clear, it means that a product does not meet its objective or is not sufficiently well-defined. ned.
Make information relevant to national stakeholders:
• Further explore how to make the information collected useful and visible
• Be prospective: on the basis of the available information, try to identify what are the ongoing challenges and perspectives, or new risks
• Be creative: what else can you do with the data gathered?
Don’t just be descriptive — present conclusions.
Reporting to these organisations is somewhat easier insofar as the expected format and contents are given.
There are, however, some important differences between reporting systems, related to the purpose of the exercise, the procedures followed for data collection, and the role of the main actors.
This is what we will describe briefly, starting with the UN reporting system, which is used worldwide.
United Nations reporting system
The UN reporting system is managed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
‘Under the International Drug Control Treaties, Member States are formally required to provide annually information on the working of the international drug control treaties.
For more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Annual Reports Questionnaires (ARQ) and it had been regularly reported to the CND (…).’ (3).
‘Review of the data collection process and preparatory activities for the development of a new annual report questionnaire.
Revision of the mechanism for collecting and reporting information’, Meeting of the expert group on data collection, Vienna, 12–15 January 2010.
The ARQ, which is currently under revision, is the cornerstone of the international data collection on drugs that informs UNODC’s global drug situation analyses and reporting.
The Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND): is the central policymaking body of the United Nations in drug-related matters.
The Commission enables Member States to analyse the global drug situation, provide follow-up to the twentieth special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem and to take measures at global level within its scope of action.
It also monitors the implementation of the three international drug control conventions and is empowered to consider all matters pertaining to the aim of the conventions, including the scheduling of substances to be brought under international control.
Inter-American Observatory on Drugs (OID).
Data collection takes place through two primary systems:
• The Inter-American Uniform Data System on Drug Consumption (SIDUC) comprises a series of standardised protocols for carrying out surveys on drug use, research on the consequences of drug use and studies on the relationship between drug use and crime.
Each of the protocols are standardised with the goal of producing information that is comparable across countries.
• The CICDAT system to collect statistics on drug supply control (uniform statistical system on control of the supply area).
This system involves an online response system where countries may enter statistical information on drug and chemical precursor seizures, arrests related to drug trafficking and other supply side indicators.
In addition, CICAD carries out a tri-annual evaluation process, known as the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism (MEM).
The MEM is a peer review process in which the Member States evaluate each other on the progress of actions taken to combat the hemispheric drug problem.
The information used for evaluation is obtained from country responses to 50 indicators that comprise the MEM Instrument in the form of a questionnaire (5).
In addition to fulfilling the MEM instrument each country prepares an introductory narrative document to contextualise the information provided in the instrument.
The EMCDDA national reporting package has three elements: a national report, statistical tables and structured questionnaires.
Source: Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism (MEM): Procedural handbook. http://www.cicad.oas.org/MEM/ENG/Questionnaires/Fifth%20Round/index.asp
• they are used to build a European picture, to analyse the situation and the evolution of the phenomenon and responses;
• the information that is compiled by the EMCDDA is used to provide the European Commission and the Member States with part of the information they need to monitor and to assess the implementation of the European strategy on drugs and its corresponding action plans.
International monitoring systems — common challenges
When carefully analysing working documents from the three supranational or international organisations briefly described above, independently of their scope, aim and competence, they share at least two challenges:
• these monitoring systems depend heavily on the quantity and quality of the information provided by their respective Member States — this information needs to be accurate, provided on time, and reliable;
• evaluation is generally separated from data collection, but data collection is essential to feed the evaluation process, which in turn feeds into decision-making.
This is where national drugs observatories can make a strong contribution while remaining in their role by providing objective, factual, reliable and comparable information, based on international standards, and well established protocols.
At this stage, two tasks are of crucial importance:
Clearly defining the reporting process (who reports to whom, and how?): in some monitoring systems, the NDO does not directly report to the international organisation (UN system, CICAD, etc.), but its data and reports feed the official national reporting.
In such cases, it may be useful to draft an agreement defining the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder, as well as a consultation mechanism that ensures that the information provided by the NDO can be integrated correctly in the national reporting process.
Establishing a mechanism for validation of the reporting package before it is sent: this can be done through quality checks, peer consultation before publication/delivery, consultation with a scientific committee or main institutional stakeholders… What is important here is to make sure that the information is officially endorsed by the NDO’s governing body before it is sent out.
This validation process may take a few weeks, but the risk arising from sending or publishing non-validated information is too great for the end user (risk of misinformation or misinterpretation) and for the NDO itself (risk to its credibility, and consequently its very existence).
When reporting to or for a supranational or international organisation:
• Clarify the process for delivery and identify the end benefi ciary of your report (the international organisation itself, or the national coordinating entity, or the Ministry of Health, or the national drugs coordinating body, etc.)
• Defi ne beforehand a scientifi c and institutional validation process (scientifi c committee, peer review, etc.)
• Make sure you provide the data and other national reporting packages on time
• Be factual and neutral, do not exceed your role: the NDO’s credibility relies on its objectivity, not the political opinions of its staff
• Ensure that the information sent out has been appropriately validated.
Integrating dissemination into a communication strategy
As already discussed, the dissemination of documents and data produced by the NDO needs to be organised to ensure that: (1) the product reaches the end-user; (2) that it matches the end-user’s needs, and; (3) that it complies with international standards and requirements.
After a needs analysis comes the time for choices, according to the NDO’s mandate and its available resources.
This is why it is important to draw a stakeholder strategy taking into account NDO resources, the availability of data and priorities.
However, the NDO’s job is not fulfilled just by ensuring the correct distribution of its products — its communication strategy should encompass not only the NDO’s products and outputs, but more broadly the services that it provides to its customers, and the activities to be developed to build its visibility and credibility among its customers.
Indeed, the long-term challenge for the NDO is to provide answers to information needs and to ensure that its various ‘clients’ are satisfied. ed.
Building on the needs assessment, the NDO drafts a stakeholder strategy taking into account resources and availability of information: for each group of stakeholders, it defines the products that could meet their needs, and organises the work of the NDO accordingly.
How to organise communication with the media
In relation to communication and dissemination, particular attention should be paid to a special group of customers: media professionals.
The next step is to consider whether the NDO’s mandate allows direct communication with s t the media, or not.
However, in the 21 century, communication cannot be reduced to whether this happens with or without the media.
A more appropriate question would be ‘how can we integrate work with media professionals in the national drug observatory’s communication strategy, within the limits of its remit?’
Even if the national coordinating body on drugs has the official role of communicating on the drug situation in the country, the NDO also has the obligation to answer information requests, including requests from media professionals.
It is therefore more constructive to see how the two bodies can work together in this area, rather than opposing their respective competences and attributions, whilst ensuring there are well-defined criteria and mechanisms to guarantee clear and efficient communication with the media.
There is no single model for the above: for example, in a country where the NDO is operated by a small team within a bigger institution, such as a National Public Health Institute, the communication policy can be defined by the main institution with the contribution of NDO staff.
This does not prevent the head of the NDO answering requests for information from journalists, but the internal procedure could imply liaising with the press relations officer of the host institution.
In countries where the NDO is established as a separate institution, communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug coordinating body, as shown in the following example (see Figure 7):
When the NDO is about to produce a new output, it either sends a preliminary confidential note to the national drug coordinating body (NDC) — if relevant — or transmits the information through the normal channels.
The main concern here is to ensure that the political powers are informed in advance of any up and coming ‘hot’ topics.
When the newly-released information is analysed, and the report (or combination of reports and statistical data) is ready, it is sent for information to the NDC and to the NDO’s communication department (if it has one), which will be responsible for preparing the launch of the report.
The NDC usually transmits the report to its own communication department.
At this stage, the strategy for communicating the information contained within the report depends on its contents and the possible consequences of the report itself: there may be a joint press release, the national drug coordination may decide to publish a specific press release for political reasons and the NDO may publish its own press release, focusing on
The information, press release(s) and various information packages are then placed on the Internet and the websites of the two institutions involved.
When relevant, the national drug coordinating body may decide to include the information in a national advertising campaign.

Working with media professionals
Media professionals include the following: journalists and editors working for different media (printed press, broadcasting, online) and with different profiles; national, local, specialised, general, etc.
Providing correct information to decisionmakers and the general public relies on quality information disseminated by the media: incorrect information or a wrong interpretation of a given situation can have major (negative) consequences.
The NDO needs to build its reputation as centre of excellence (i.e. best value data and first hand information) and of reference (for all kind of requests), being both proactive and reactive in informing and bringing together providers and recipients of
Building a national drugs observatory: a joint handbook information (6
Professionals from the media basically need two kinds of information: regular and comprehensive information on the drugs situation and any emerging drug-related issue, and answers to specific questions linked to the general debate on the drugs situation and its responses in the country concerned.
Communicating on drugs is difficult, because the topic is a passionate and emotional one.
Alongside this, the world of the media works under incredible pressure: information must be given quickly; there is competition between newspapers and other media; and a great amount of pressure to measure audiences because this impacts on advertisement revenue.
None of the above are conducive to well-developed and balanced articles.
The frenzied search for the latest ‘scoop’ can lead to mistakes, as shown in the box below.
Most frequent mistakes found in the media about drugs
• Exaggeration• Overstatement and repetition• Misinterpretation and confusion• No time for checking figures and rumour• Unconscious promotion of drugs

Get to know key journalists, build a long-term relationship with them, be simple, try to understand their constraints and the way they think, so as to format the information for them.
Two principles can help you when you prepare any press briefing:

KISS (Keep It Short and Simple).
When communicating with the media (
• Keep scientifi c information and political messages separate• Identify a ‘press contact’ for internal transparency
• Any person contacted by a journalist must refer the request to the NDO’s communication department (or to the public relations officer if no such department)
• Ensure that the fi gures that are being communicated are appropriate for release to the general public
When working with journalists (
• Know your counterparts• Build confi dence with drug journalists• Be accurate/admit when you don’t know something• Avoid clichés• Be on time• Insist on quality information and cooperation• Multimedia strategy is a must today:

In this chapter, we propose some tools for making a strategic diagnosis of the NDO with reference to its institutional challenges, bearing in mind that each situation is unique.
Our approach will focus on three key strategic factors (KSFs) to be considered in order to ensure the NDO’s sustainability.
Institutional issues are only one of the challenges faced by an NDO: the core operations are what give the substance and legitimacy of the work of national drugs observatories.
These were presented in detail in the previous chapter.
To make a strategic diagnosis, we must analyse the NDO’s situation by describing the strengths and the weaknesses in terms of each KSF, using specific criteria to cover a broad range of topics/issues.
The diagnosis should ideally be based on facts and figures.
Definition
A key strategic factor defines a structural characteristic of the organisation and of its
1 ): environment which is essential in order to achieve its goals and objectives (
‘We invented the term ‘strategic factors’ to cover items not previously identified separately.
Strategic factors describe those few things that an organisation or business unit has to get right in
2 order to succeed with its key stakeholders’ (
Key strategic factors and public services
To start identifying the key strategic factors, we start with the observation that any request for public funding is supposed to provide a clear definition of the expected results (= deliverables) and also justify the need for such an investment in a time when choices have to be made (= added value).
As NDOs are usually established within public institutions or with public funds, for the purpose of our analysis we will use methodological tools and concepts developed to study strategic management in public services.
See: http://www.strategicfactors.com/Kenny, G., ’Stakeholders and Strategic Management’, presented at the US Academy of Management Conference, Atlanta 11–16 August, 2006.
We refer in particular to a study published by Alford in 2001, in which he presents a few characteristics that can apply to NDOs (we italicise):
• ‘contrarily to what happens in the private sector where the value of a product is defined by its market, in the public sector the value of the products is assessed partly through the perception by the clients and stakeholders, which in turn attracts the permission (mandate) for their production (= authorising environment);
• the clients and stakeholders play a decisive role in allocating the resources that are needed to develop the institution, both in terms of budget but also in terms of the legal authority that give the organisation the ‘public power’ to fulfil its mandate (= political environment);
• the organisational capabilities that are involved in the production process are not exclusively based within a single institution, but are depending from different institutions and partners (co-production)’ (3).
As far as the situation of the NDO is concerned, we observe that:
• NDO production depends on its cooperation with other national sources of information and of expertise, in most of the cases it cannot work on its own (co-production)
• the NDO builds its capacity on the basis of diverse resources and partners, at national, local and supranational level (combined resources)
• to ensure its sustainability, the NDO must answer the needs of various audiences at different levels, who either play or could play a role in providing extra resources (perceived added value)
• these key factors are interconnected and inter-dependent.
Based on the above, we propose considering the following as key strategic factors for the strategic diagnosis of a national drugs observatory: perceived value, co-production and combined resources.
The NDO’s position in terms of these strategic factors must be assessed:
• when it is set up, in order to identify existing resources and means, as well as clarify the mandate for its establishment;
• at any time during the NDO’s existence to assess its situation and take appropriate measures to ensure its sustainability.
KSF 1 — Perceived added value
This is the first factor to consider when establishing an NDO: its relevance may seem less obvious to the project promoters, but this aspect must be argued in order to convince both decisionmakers and potential partners.
Alford, J. (2001), ‘The implications of “publicness” for strategic management theory’ in Exploring Public Strategy, Johnson, G. and Scholes, K., Pearson Education 2001, pp 1–16.
Bearing in mind the NDO’s situation, we can say that:
• the value of its work is quite complex to assess, as it is a response to a political decision that affects the country as a whole, including reporting obligations;
• the value of the NDO’s work is not always measurable — it depends on the perception of those who receive its products and outputs;
• the value of the NDO’s work must be assessed taking into account that a national need is not necessarily perceived as such by all institutions and individuals;
• most importantly, even if the NDO was established to meet some international obligations, if cannot fulfil its role if it does not answer national needs.
At this point, try not to think in one dimension.
For example, if you present the project explaining that there will be new scientific data available from surveys and drug-related research because you are a scientist, this may be of great scientific value, but a weak argument if it does not address the needs of other stakeholders (for instance, decisionmakers who are asked to provide funds).
To conclude: try to identify and define the NDO’s perceived or potential added value from the point of view of its audience/stakeholders, rather than from one of its promoters (see box below).
Example of how to ask the question: ‘What is an NDO?
What are you doing?’, when asked by a decision-maker:
DO
• give a concrete definition of what it is• briefly say how it can be useful for the person asking the question• always translate into terms that meet the stakeholder’s needs (either expressed or supposed)
(the famous ‘elevator pitch’ can be a good way of preparing for this situation, or think of the ‘so what?’ we talked about earlier);
DON’T
• use vague administrative or scientific terms, such as
‘it is an institution that collects information on drugs and sends a national report to…’‘every three or four years we publish a report about a national survey in schools’
Note: an ‘elevator pitch’ (or elevator speech) is an overview of an idea for a product, service, or project.
The name reflects the fact that an elevator pitch can be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride (for example, thirty seconds and 50–100 words).

To support the perceived value of the NDO, we propose using three categories of criteria to identify additional actions/measures: added value of NDO’s products, credibility, and relations with its audiences and stakeholders.
Figure 8: KSF 1 — Perceived added value
Criteria
Description (main elements)
Added value of the NDO’s products
Relations with audiences and stakeholders
Added value of the NDO’s products
Outputs: Is the NDO producing only one report per year?
What is its content and format?
Is this report published in the national language(s) and is it disseminated at national level?
Is the NDO producing more targeted products for well identified groups or subgroups of ‘clients’?
Are the NDO’s products published only for a specific purpose or are there complementary publications targeting non-specialised audiences?
Quality: Are the NDO’s reports considered good quality?
Are the NDO’s products perceived as easy to understand by decisionmakers and the general public?
Is the general image of NDO’s publications more of a scientific authority or is it perceived as being influenced by political or ideological considerations?
Visibility: How would you assess the NDO’s visibility?
Do the main existing or potential stakeholders know about its existence and do they know what they can ask the NDO?
Is the NDO considered as the main or one of the main references for drug-related information in the country?
General and ad hoc requests: does anybody ask the NDO for standard or ad hoc requests?
Is the NDO promoting itself as the reference organisation that can tailor information according to the needs of its customers?
Relations with audience(s) and stakeholder(s)
Promotion: does the NDO have established formal/informal relations with its audience/stakeholders?
Is the NDO trying to address the needs of national ‘clients’, even if its main aim is to produce a national report for an international organisation?
Is there any policy within the NDO to identify existing or potential needs for drug-related information among its audiences and its stakeholders?
Media relations: how would you characterise the NDO’s relations with the media?
Does the NDO have a public relations (PR) policy and a PR officer?
Can the NDO communicate directly with media?
Do newspapers and journalists know the NDO exists and do they refer to its reports and publications?
Do they spontaneously contact the NDO when they need some information on the drugs issue in the country or abroad?
KSF 2 — Co-production
What does co-production, or ‘collaborative production’ mean for an NDO?
It means that the NDO usually depends on existing sources of information and expertise available in the country to produce its own deliverables.
In fact, in many cases, most of the NDO’s products are the result of partnerships and cooperation, and external expertise may be needed also to validate its analyses and reports.
To be involved almost permanently in a co-production process has very important consequences when organising the NDO’s work.
• establish a partnership with existing sources of information and national experts, both for data collection purposes and for developing reporting capacity;
• ensure that its partners derive mutual benefit from the data collection and reporting system: it is important partners are motivated to provide the data, as this has an impact on the quality of the data collected;
• realise that national monitoring capacity is the combination of different resources rather than their concentration;
• take into account the fact that competences and responsibilities are increasingly being transferred from central to regional or local level in many countries.
This creates a greater need for convergence between co-production activities.
To support assessing the NDO’s situation in terms of co-production, we propose considering three categories of criteria for diagnosis: operating framework, reporting procedures and outputs.
Figure 9: KSF 2 — Co-production
Operating framework
Operating framework
Information map: is an information map drafted and permanently updated so as to identify any source of expertise and information available in the country, and is there any communication policy geared towards the strategic partners?
Established partnerships: describes the NDO’s operating framework with the key sources of expertise and information in the country.
Is there a formal partnership agreement between the main data providers and the NDO?
Relations with data providers: does the NDO have regular meetings with its data providers?
Are the data providers informed about the events/decisions/activities organised by the NDO at national or at supranational level?
Are there provisions for sharing the results of the cooperation?
National reports: does the NDO draft its report(s) alone or in consultation/cooperation with national experts?
Are the reports presented to national experts and to national data providers so as to ensure ownership of the results and a confrontation of the results of the data analysis with the experience of professionals working in the field?
National working groups: are national working groups of experts established for relevant groups of indicators and for national reporting?
Do these working groups meet regularly and try to improve the instruments and also data clarity?
Is any feedback given to the institutions and professionals collecting the information in the field?
Content: do contents of reports and other publications reflect the need for a multidisciplinary and multifaceted approach in relation to the drugs phenomenon, or in most cases do they focus on one part of the problem?
Do the NDO’s projects and outputs give a balanced view of the drugs phenomenon, addressing both demand and supply issues?
Quality assurance: is there shared responsibility for quality assurance and quality control?
Are there any quality control procedures before a report is published?
Does the NDO promote the adoption of best practice for quality assurance through sharing and disseminating experience and knowledge with other countries and/or supranational organisations?
Mutual benefits: is the NDO completely isolated?
Are there institutions challenging or even contesting its legitimacy?
Does the NDO acknowledge the value and competences of other institutions already working in the field?
Do partnerships offer mutual benefit to the institutions involved?
Is the NDO playing a role in the exploitation and promotion of existing resources at local and at national level?
Is the NDO managing to provide something useful to its partners in exchange for their data and/or expertise?
KSF 3 — Combined resources
Human and financial resources are frequently presented as the starting point for any project.
However, we propose a different approach, based on the principle that obtaining resources can be more successful if it is the result of combined efforts targeting also KSF 1 (perceived value) and KSF 2 (co-production).
Here again, we suggest being less self-focused.
The main priority for the promoter or NDO head is undoubtedly funds and human resources.
This means he/she will tend to promote the ‘institution’.
However, those contacted for funds need to see why they should give money to an NDO instead of something else.
This means promoting the ‘expected results and benefits’ in any written or spoken proposal.
There is also a more empirical reason for this approach.
NDOs are not created out of thin air in a vacuum.
There are already at least some institutions and professionals on the field who have information, data and/or expertise on the drugs phenomenon.
The first step in preparing a project to set up an NDO must identify these actors and meet with them, in order to see what is available and what can already be done with existing resources (see the chapter on the information map).
There are three underlying principles that support this approach:
• more can always be achieved when resources are pooled;
• when meeting decisionmakers as part of a fund-raising or awareness-raising operation, it is very important to be able to show what has been done so far, and what should/could be done with the additional means requested;
• at operational level, to have identified and cooperated at least with some of the potential partners at the preparatory stage is a positive indicator of the NDO’s capacity to stimulate and manage the expected co-production process.
We should stress that for this key strategic factor, as for the two others, we privilege a multifaceted and systemic approach: talking about resources only makes sense if everybody shares the need to be a resource.
The NDO can only receive or benefit from other partners’ resources if it turns itself into a resource for them.
To describe this KSF, a broader range of topics than just the NDO’s budget should be considered.
This is why we propose three categories: institutional support, operational capacity, scientific capacity.
Figure 10: KSF 3 — Combined resources
Institutional support
Scientific capacity
NDO mandate and status: do politicians and other decisionmakers fully support the project to set up an NDO?
Does the NDO have a clear organisational status, is it recognised as a specific entity, and does it have a clear mandate for sharing and requesting data and information from other institutions and organisations?
Is there any binding resolution from the national authorities on their own or in relation to any supranational organisation that supports setting up the NDO and the national data collection network?
Reporting and status of NDO products: has a mechanism for evaluating the work of the NDO and its outputs been foreseen?
Is the NDO expected to provide decisionmakers with
Does the work of the NDO contribute to national reporting obligations?
Does the NDO have a specific and explicit role in the national strategy document aimed at providing the evidence needed to monitor the implementation and evaluation of this national strategy?
Staff and budget: is there a specific budget adopted on a yearly basis or an ad hoc non-recurrent funding for specific activities?
Is the mission and work of the NDO described in a yearly work programme with staff assigned exclusively to the NDO on a full-time basis?
Are the job profiles and salaries offered in line with the qualifications required and does the NDO have the necessary equipment (PCs, software, telecoms, documentation) to perform its tasks?
Does the NDO have a strategy to liaise with national authorities to maintain or increase the level of investment in the drug-related data collection system?
Networking and partnerships: is there any national expertise that could complement the expertise available at the NDO, and if so is there any formal mechanism or project to facilitate cooperation with the experts concerned?
Budget for routine and ad hoc data collection: are budgets available in other institutions and ministries for routine data collection?
Is there any specific or general programme at state level that includes a provision for commissioning ad hoc studies, research or surveys to which the NDO can apply?
Does the country cooperate with — and have access to — funding from international or supranational organisations such as the EU, UNODC, WHO, OAS, CARICOM or the Global Fund?
Data and information: are there any drug-related data that are routinely collected at national or local level?
Are there plans for new routine data collection that would totally or partially meet international standards?
What is the feasibility and likelihood to prepare and present new projects for routine data collection?
What are the obstacles and what are the possible solutions (financial, methodological, etc.)?
Are the main groups of indicators and other sets of core data available in the country?
What are the realistic perspectives for an improvement of the situation?
Is there anything that can be done at a reasonable cost to prepare their implementation?
Is there any protocol ready and adopted that could be presented to supra- or international organisations (WHO, UNODC, World Bank, Global Fund, etc.) for further support?
Scientific and professional expertise: are there any drug-related research activities in the country that could provide some information on the drugs situation, or that could benefit from the support and cooperation with the NDO?
Are there universities that are or could be interested in a partnership, ranging from the provision of scientific expertise or sending students for traineeship to the NDO, to sharing the data collected so as to allow the university to support a PhD research?
Building a national drugs observatory: a joint handbook of their clients, needs assessments or programmes/projects evaluations that could be useful to understand the situation?
Key strategic factors: an interactive and dynamic model
Although the key strategic factors have been presented separately, it should be noted that they are part of an interactive and dynamic model and that they can be used for identifying the strategic opportunities for the setting up and strengthening of any NDO.
When preparing to set up or assess an NDO, we suggest using these criteria and grouping the information collected in a summary table, describing for each criterion the objective, current situation and actions to be undertaken.
This becomes a sound base for preparing a strategic plan for the development of the national drugs observatory.
A strategic plan aims to make sure that the NDO will consolidate or improve its situation and will maximise its position as regards the three key strategic factors, which could be summarised as follows:
• to ensure more perceived added value from its stakeholders at national and at local level;
• to improve and to diversify the co-production scheme so as to produce better products which are tailored to the needs of its different client groups;
• to better combine the resources from national and local level, both in terms of data and of expertise, so as to consolidate the co-production processes and the quality of publications and other outputs.
The analytical framework proposed is dynamic and flexible: there is no single model for NDOs that should be applied indistinctly to any country and to any situation.
What matters is establishing a system that can produce quality reports at an affordable cost and within a reasonable time frame, in a language and with conclusions that are easy to understand by its clients.
In the current context of general socio-economic difficulties, one should avoid the temptation of presenting exaggerated objectives and excessive requests for funding.
These will not only be refused by the decision-makers, but will also give the NDO and its promoters a negative image that might prove fatal for the organisation’s survival.
When presenting the various categories of criteria describing the key strategic factors, we have presented the situation (where we are), what could be the objectives (where we want to be), and what actions need to be undertaken (what we need to do).
However, when preparing the strategic plan, we recommend limiting the information to the objectives and the actions to be undertaken, which is the critical information for the choices to be made.
Indeed, the strategic diagnosis and the strategic plan are tools that support decision-making at NDO and stakeholder level: the better the information, the easier the decision-making process.
However, these tools are based on a pre-requisite: DO think about what you can already do with what you and your partners have, DON’T say ‘I cannot do anything until I get more’.

The table above gives an overview of the NDO and its national drug information network’s main goals.
It should be prepared on the basis of objective and reliable information, ensuring balance and giving links between the three key strategic factors.
Where should the national drugs observatory be located?
What legal status should it have?
What should the scope of its mandate be?
In this chapter we will present and provide some elements of response to common questions frequently asked about national drugs observatories, and to which there is usually no single answer.
If you have more, please e-mail your question to the EMCDDA or CICAD at: info@emcdda.europa.eu and OID_CICAD@oas.org.
Options for consideration
This depends on how decision-making is organised in your country.
Here are examples of existing situations:
• within national drug coordination bodies or under government departments;• within the Ministry of Health or within the National Institute for Public Health;• within the Ministry of the Interior, Home Affairs, Justice or National Security;• within a university or a non-governmental organisation.
Strengths and weaknesses
When the NDO is placed under the authority of the national drug coordination body or a government department, this improves the NDO’s chances of collecting information covering the whole range of data, from all institutions, covering both supply and demand.
However, if too close politically, the NDO’s scientific credibility and objectivity and even long-term stability may be challenged.
If the NDO is located within or under the Ministry of Health, this is usually very beneficial when collecting data on health and social issues, but less effective for supply and supply reduction data.
The capacity of developing a comprehensive analysis of the drugs situation (= beyond specific public health issues) is not always guaranteed.
It is important to ensure that cooperation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the supply side.
If the NDO is located within or under the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, Home Affairs, Justice or National Security, this offers more opportunities to obtain data on supply
Building a national drugs observatory: a joint handbook and supply reduction, but less on social and health issues.
The capacity of developing a comprehensive analysis of the drugs situation (= beyond specific law enforcement competence) is not always guaranteed.
It is important to ensure that cooperation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the demand side.
An NDO located within a university or NGO can be a good option for scientific work, to ensure neutrality and objectivity of the information gathered, and could offer some very useful multidisciplinary additional input.
However, sometimes the NDO remains too far from decision-makers, lacks visibility and institutional support of its role at national level.
When there are difficulties and a lack of cooperation between institutions from the health sector and those from the law enforcement area, experience suggests that a solution which promotes and improves inter-institutional cooperation is more efficient and more sustainable in the long term than a solution involving splitting the NDO into a ‘health observatory’ and a ‘law enforcement observatory’.
Most of the existing national drugs observatories have the following in common:
• they are established on the basis of (minimum) a ministerial decision appointing them either as the national observatory (for national purposes) or the national correspondent or national focal point to supranational or international organisations;
• their work is defined by some terms of reference, either as a single entity or as a unit/section within a bigger institution.
There is a huge variation in the legal status’ of NDOs, which ranges basically from a simple extension of the status of an existing institution, to a decision published in the national Official Journal to create a new institution — a new legal entity with its own identity.
It is worth mentioning here that there are also different options insofar as the type of organisation hosting or becoming national drugs observatory is concerned: it can be a public body, but also a semi-public body, or in some cases an NGO.
When the establishment of the NDO is based on a ministerial decision without any specific legal status it is frequently too weak to allow the NDO to fulfil its mandate and obtain cooperation from other institutions, especially ministries and organisations working in a different area (usually health/social versus law enforcement).
If the NDO is established at a too low structural and hierarchical level within an existing institution, this presents the same disadvantages and also gives no visibility to the NDO and its products.
It then becomes extremely difficult for the NDO to fulfil its mandate and address the needs of its stakeholders at national level.
If the establishment of the NDO is formalised through a multi-annual framework contract (between three and five years), this has the dual advantage of consolidating the NDO’S position for a period long enough so as to encourage cooperation and reduce competition from other institutions whilst defining the NDOs mission and expected results clearly.
This can serve as a basis for assessing its performance at the end of the period.
If the establishment of the NDO is not formalised, or is considered as unlimited, this may expose the NDO and its customers either to a risk of permanent instability — for instance when political change occurs in the country — or to a risk of poor long-term development because of a lack of incentives.
The latter may be observed in cases where the interest of some professionals may lie more with the institution’s position than its performance.
A clear legal status is a necessary condition for developing the work of the NDO but is not sufficient to guarantee participation and cooperation of potential partners: what makes the difference is the NDO’s capacity to motivate and associate its partners in a collaborative work process through networking (in other words: cooperation cannot be obtained by decree).
The legal status can be extremely useful to formalise the inter-institutional and interagency cooperation as it ‘obliges’ third parties to respect and recognise the NDO’s role.
The following two options should be considered:
• limiting the scope of the NDO’s work to illicit drugs, for instance to remain consistent with the scope of the work of supranational and international organisations such the EMCDDA and UNODC;
• broadening the scope to cover any kind of licit and illicit drugs (illicit drugs, alcohol, tobacco, legal drugs), which is the case for countries that have a comprehensive national strategy that addresses these issues together, and which is consistent with the work of international organisations such as CICAD–OAS, the World Health Organization (WHO), and of some research groups developing international surveys such as ESPAD.
If the NDO’s scope is extended to licit substances, this gives an excellent opportunity to build a comprehensive image of complex social and individual behaviours linked to addiction.
It can also provide the opportunity to observe and analyse possible correlations between
Building a national drugs observatory: a joint handbook trends of use.
However, this also makes the work of the NDO more complex, both from an organisational and scientific perspective.
If the objectives and expected results are realistically and clearly defined, whatever the scope of the NDO’s mandate, all work must be productive and relevant.
In all situations, the resources that the NDO is allocated to do its job must be consistent with the scope of its mandate.
To address this issue, one should consider the following:
• The national drugs observatory’s technical competence should ideally mirror the wide range of subject areas covered by its scope and mandate;
• The technical and scientific know-how of the NDO and partners should be developed as part of a permanent improvement of its scientific capacity;
• Scientific background: the team in the NDO should have the necessary skills to cover all aspects of the monitoring and reporting framework.
Main profiles could therefore include: epidemiologist, sociologist, psychologist or other social scientist, toxicologist, statistician, criminologist and policy analyst;
• Managerial and communication skills: general management, communication and networking, editing and dissemination as well as secretarial support are all likely to be needed;
• At least half of the staff should have a certain degree of professional experience and preferably clear scientific qualifications.
In addition, in the European Union all staff should ideally be fluent in English as a working language (especially for international standards and protocols, scientific exchanges of know-how and expertise with different countries and regions of the world);
• The NDO needs to attract and to keep competent staff, and it needs to be stable so as to ensure both its scientific capacity and the quality of its processes and deliveries;
• Each country should find the structure and organisation that matches best with supranational and international reporting tasks and the national context;
• Some countries with very limited resources have no choice but to start with one person.
In such conditions, an observatory can work if some or part of the core functions are taken on by key external partners (e.g. a university), with the NDO coordinating the processes that are externalised.
If the NDO is a rather small unit, this should be compensated with formal agreements for the secondment of the missing scientific resources.
However, experience shows that when the
1 number of staff falls under three full-time posts or their equivalent (
), the NDO cannot fulfil its tasks.
If the NDO is established as a small unit, it often tends to rely too heavily on external expertise and sometimes poorly-organised national networks.
With a team that is too small, management and networking activities that are critical for the NDO become a real challenge.
If the NDO is given an important national mandate as an observatory, this implies that the competences required need to cover the full range of core functions as described in Chapters 3 to 5.
If this is the case, special attention must be paid to institutional relations and cooperation, and to communication and public relations.
In order to provide policymakers with a comprehensive picture of the budgetary and financial implications involved in setting up an NDO, the national drugs observatory and national drugs information network must be considered together.
The estimated cost should be based on an assessment of the following criteria:
• The running costs of the NDO in terms of staff and operations, including meetings with national and international partners;
• Specific costs associated to the mission and tasks of the NDO, spread along the three key operating processes: data collection, analysis and interpretation, reports and publications;
• In some cases it may be relevant to make a distinction between costs for national and international obligations;
• It may be necessary to draft financial plans that set yearly running costs.
However, in the beginning, the estimated cost of the national drugs information network will not be known, and the NDO will not usually start by immediately collecting data through a national survey.
This means that the budget can be more limited for the first year of activity.
However, budgetary objectives for years two and three should be considered, at least as a reasonable perspective (2);
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets — it is closely linked to the NDO’s capacity to deliver outputs and be accountable for the use of funds.
This means that either in the NDO or its host institution there must be someone with sound administrative and financial management skills;
This means that some may be working in different institutions and seconded to the NDO.When the NDO is based within a public body, budgetary perspectives and commitments usually cannot exceed one year.
A sudden change or imbalance in the NDO’s finances during an operational year is extremely damageable to both the NDO and its network.
This may also affect the delivery of the outputs to supranational and international organisations, which may have negative consequences for the country’s reputation.
If the budget available is limited but known and stable, this may enable the NDO to prepare a strategy to apply for complementary funds from other national or international donors: for instance some former candidate countries to the EU managed to obtain complementary resources from the Global Fund for financing new data collection exercises.
If the NDO manages to build a national action plan for the drug information network and can clearly show what are the expected results for precise cost estimates, it will have a better chance of being taken seriously.
Sometimes a supranational or international organisation will provide funds for operating the NDO and the data collection can only deliver sustainable results if some structural counterpart is required — and obtained — from the national authorities.
When this issue is discussed, avoid confusion between ‘scientific quality’, and ‘institutional autonomy’, which are two different things.
• Scientific quality is extremely important to ensure that the data are correctly presented and interpreted, that they are true and trustworthy, and that they meet international standards.
This may be guaranteed by establishing a scientific committee linked to the NDO, or by defining a consultation/proof-reading procedure among the key stakeholders, which should review outputs before their publication.
The objective of this review is to ensure that there are neither mistakes nor any misinterpretation of the data, and to validate the publication.
This in turn gives more legitimacy to the NDO.
There should be no compromise on the quality of the NDO’s outputs.
• Institutional autonomy refers to something different: the NDO should be preserved from external attempts to transform data, give false information, encourage propaganda or political correctness.
The NDO is primarily operational in the area of information and is not involved in politics.
At the same time, the NDO must define and to keep a position in relation to other institutions or key actors in the country.
A situation where the scientific quality of the NDO’s work is tainted is unacceptable.
Despite possible attempts to disguise interference, it is usually detected by international organisations.
This is harmful for the reputation of the country concerned.
An NDO that works without any statutory body nor quality control procedure for its publications is in a dangerous situation: in the past, some NDOs have been through challenging situations because they presented information that had not been verified and validated by their key stakeholders.
If the NDO is too closely associated with national authorities or politicians, this can cause a prejudice to its autonomy, its reputation and credibility, and its stability (every time there is a political change, staff may be removed and then expertise lost).
If the NDO is or tries to be too independent, it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks.
As already mentioned, the NDO needs to pay special attention to avoid crossing institutional and competence boundaries.
National drugs observatories may contribute to the evaluation of national drug policies or of specific aspects of national strategies, at the request of their respective national authorities.
However, to make this possible and relevant, a few principles need to be respected:
• there should be an official request addressed to the NDO by its national authority, indicating the scope and the objectives of the evaluation;
• the NDO should be able to propose or to define a methodology, in line with best practice in this area, to identify the information that would be needed, and to assess whether this information is currently available (estimating costs if some data are missing).
The same applies to the expertise needed to conduct the evaluation;
• the NDO should reserve the right to accept — or to propose a technical modification in order to accept — to perform the evaluation;
• the NDO’s contribution to the evaluation should be on scientific grounds (factual, neutral, objective, reliable) and should avoid making political conclusions that are the remit of national authorities;
• the NDO should clarify what are the questions of the evaluation for which there is no evidence available.
When the scope of the work carried out by the NDO within the evaluation is clearly limited, this gives more chances for the results to be accepted without damaging the NDO.
However there have been situations in which despite these precautions, some political actors have accused the NDO of a lack of objectivity and of being ‘politically oriented’ — if not, providing ‘false’ data.
This is why all of the NDO’s actions linked to any evaluation must be scientifically sound and well documented.
International assistance, provided either during the evaluation, for instance in a scientific steering committee or for a peer review may also help counter such potential negative reactions.
If the scope of the work and mandate of the NDO are well defined in close cooperation and with the participation of the national drug coordination and the main NDO stakeholders, this can bring real added value to the country and may help to support decision-making and the planning of services.
It usually also helps to better define objectives, and to better identify existing and new data needed for measuring the performance or the impact of some measures.
What comes next?
How can we translate theory into practice?
Through the different chapters and sections of this handbook, the reader has been given a comprehensive presentation of national drugs observatories, in particular:
• a clear definition of what is an observatory, its mission and objectives;
• a detailed presentation of its three core functions which are: data collection and monitoring; data analysis and interpretation; reporting and dissemination;
• an introduction to strategic diagnosis based on three key strategic factors (KSFs) and their related criteria — perceived added value, co-production and combined resources;
• and finally, a suggestion of some options to be considered when setting up a national drugs observatory, with the main strengths and weaknesses of each option.
The time has now come to develop your own vision and to take this forward into practice.
As you start on this process, we invite you to take a different look at the context you work and live in.
Taking on board the ideas, concepts and experiences that have been shared with you in this handbook, you must now build a vision of what your national drugs observatory should be like.
It is very important that you describe your needs and plans in your own words, taking into account the resources and constraints you face, as each national observatory is a unique combination of competences, resources and partnerships, and above all human beings.
One last suggestion: use the processes and expected outputs as a starting point and build a system and a network around them.
There are no institutional models to be copied — it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal.

Looking back at this long process, there seemed to be a need to formalise the experiences in the field, and to identify some key concepts and principles that remain valid irrespective of country or region.
This handbook, a joint production by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States (CICAD–OAS), presents and describes in a clear and informative way the core operational processes and the key strategic factors that are common to all national drugs observatories.
The handbook is available in English, French and Spanish.
Other language versions are planned for 2011.
About the EMCDDA
About CICAD-OAS
The Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) was established by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1986 as the western hemisphere's policy forum on all aspects of the drug problem.
CICAD's core mission is to enhance the human and institutional capacities of its Member States to reduce the production, trafficking and use of illegal drugs, and to address the health, social and criminal consequences of the drug trade.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is the hub of drug-related information in Europe.
Its mission is to provide the EU and its Member States with ‘factual, objective, reliable and comparable information’ on drugs, drug addiction and their consequences.
Established in 1993, it opened its doors in Lisbon in 1995 and is one of the EU’s decentralised agencies.
With a 100-strong multidisciplinary team, the agency offers policymakers the evidence base they need for drawing up drug laws and strategies.
It also helps professionals and researchers pinpoint best practice and new areas for analysis.
As well as gathering information on the demand and reduction of the demand for drugs, the agency in recent years has extended its monitoring and reporting on drug supply, supply reduction and illicit drug markets.
Data collection in the CICAD system takes place within the context of the Inter-American Observatory on Drugs (OID).
The Observatory helps countries to improve the collection and analysis of drug-related data: by promoting the establishment of national observatories and the use of standardised methods and data; and by providing scientific and technical training for, and the exchange of experiences among professionals working on drug issues all with the aim of informing national drug policy and related actions.
Overview
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is the hub of drug-related information in the European Union.
Its role is togather, analyse and disseminate ‘objective, reliable and comparableinformation’ on drugs and drug addiction and, in doing so, provide itsaudiences with a sound and evidence-based picture of the drug phenomenonat European level.
Among the Centre’s target groups are policy-makers who use this informationto help formulate coherent national and Community drug strategies.
Alsoserved are professionals and researchers working in the drugs field and,more broadly, the European media and general public.
Established:1993Director:Georges Estievenart Staff: 72 Address: Rua da Cruz de Santa Apolónia 23-251149-045 Lisbon, Portugal Tel. (351) 218 11 30 00Fax(351) 218 13 17 11 info@emcdda.eu.int http://www.emcdda.eu.int
One of the agency’s key aims is to render drug information more comparableacross Europe.
This allows countries to gauge how they fit into the wider European picture and examine common problems and responses to drugs.
To this end, the Centre has developed methods and tools for harmonisingdata and helping to assess how the EU Strategy and Action Plan on Drugs(2000–2004) are being implemented.
Its Annual report on the state of thedrugs problem in the European Union and Norwayis a fruit of these efforts,providing a yearly overview of the latest situation and trends.
Since 2002,this report has been complemented by a Report on the drug situation in thecandidate CEECs.
The Centre obtains information primarily from the ‘Reitox network’, a groupof focal points in each of the 15 EU Member States, Norway, the 13candidate countries to the EU and at the European Commission.
But while the EMCDDA is primarily Europe-focused, it has increasing ties with countriesfurther afield, forging links with organisations in other world regions.
The EMCDDA works on the assumption that sound information is the key toan effective strategy on drugs.
Although the Centre cannot propose any kindof policy model, it is now making a clear impact on decision-making throughits analyses, instruments and standards.

We are pleased to present this summary of the 2007 European school survey findings produced by the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD).
We have made this summary available in 23 languages to ensure the widest possible dissemination in Europe.
It serves as a complement to the full report that is available in English.
This multilingual summary is a product of the cooperation framework that exists between the EMCDDA and ESPAD.
Our common aims are: to broaden access to the information and expertise on alcohol and other drug use among school students developed by the ESPAD project; to improve the availability, quality and comparability of school survey data; and to gain maximum analytical insight from the data available in this area.
The mandate of the EMCDDA is to collect, analyse and disseminate factual, objective, reliable and comparable information on the European drug situation.
The information provided by the ESPAD project is an important source of information for obtaining the European picture on younger people.
The ESPAD project provides a common approach to collecting information on substance use among 15- to 16-year-old students in Europe and allows trends over time to be assessed.
The work of the ESPAD project would not have been possible without the generous support of the Swedish Government, the Swedish National Institute of Public Health and the Pompidou Group.
We would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the governmental and non governmental partners in ESPAD countries that contribute to the funding, data collection, analysis and dissemination of this important work.
Summary performed in 7 out of 16 federal states (Bundesländer) while the Belgian data collection was restricted to the Dutch speaking part (Flanders).
The main purpose of the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) is to collect comparable data on substance use among 15–16 year-old European students in order to monitor trends within as well as between countries.
So far four data collection waves have been conducted within the ESPAD project.
The first study was held in 26 countries in 1995, while the 2007 data collection was performed in 35 countries.
This summary presents key results from the 2007 survey as well as findings regarding the longterm trends.
An initial section gives a short overview of the methodology.
The content of the international report is based on standardised country reports and datasets delivered to the coordinators and the database manager.
A few countries have experienced modest problems of a methodological kind, but these are not of the magnitude to seriously threaten the comparability of the results, and the overall validity is deemed high for most countries.
Country sample sizes were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries, where fewer, but all relevant, students were surveyed.
However, a combination of a small gross sample and a high school-dropout level in Denmark led to a net sample which was too small to be considered fully representative, and thereby fully comparable.
Independent research teams in the participating countries form the basis of the collaborative project.
In the 2007 ESPAD data collection more than 100 000 students took part from the following countries: Armenia, Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany (7 Bundesländer), Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.
Data were mainly collected during spring 2007 and the target population was students born in 1991, with a mean age of 15.8 years at the time of data collection.
A small number of questions regarding cigarette smoking are given at the beginning of the questionnaire.
On average, in the 2007 survey, 58 % of the students in participating countries reported having tried smoking cigarettes at least once and 29 % had used cigarettes during the past 30 days.
Two percent of all students had smoked at least a packet of cigarettes per day during the past 30 days.
Data were collected by group-administered questionnaires.
The students answered the questionnaires anonymously in the classroom with teachers or research assistants functioning as survey leaders.
With two exceptions the class-samples are nationally representative: in Germany the study was
The ranking orders of countries for lifetime and relatively recent use (past 30 days) are more or less the same.
Alcohol past 30 days are Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Latvia (40–45 %) and low prevalence countries are Armenia, Iceland, Norway and Portugal (7–19 %).
There is no obvious geographical pattern at hand, but students in central and eastern European countries are often among those reporting higher rates of smoking.
In all ESPAD countries at least two thirds of the students have drunk alcohol at least once during their lifetime, with an ESPAD average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey.
The corresponding average figures for the past 12 months and the past 30 days are 82 and 61 % respectively. These figures were relatively unchanged from 1995 to 2007 for lifetime and past 12 months prevalences, while past 30 days figures increased until 2003 before they dropped a little in 2007, especially among boys.
In countries where more students smoke, one is also more likely to find students reporting that cigarettes are easily obtainable.
An early smoking debut (age 13 or younger) is also associated, at the country level, with high levels of use in the past month.
On average, 7 % of the students said that they had been smoking cigarettes on a daily basis at the age of 13 or younger.
Daily cigarette use at this early age is most common among students in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia and the Slovak Republic (prevalence rates of about 13 %) and least common among students in Greece and Romania (around 3 %).
For example, alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark (limited comparability) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia.
However, in individual countries great differences may be observable.
For example, boys were 16 percentage points above girls in Armenia and conversely, girls were 19 percentage points above boys in Monaco.
The figures for lifetime, past 12 months and past 30 days prevalences are about the same for boys and girls.
However, when it comes to higher frequencies in the respective time frame (40, 20 and 10 times) the proportions are usually higher among boys.
These high frequencies are mainly reported by students in Austria and Germany (7 Bundesländer), while the Nordic countries Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden belong to those with only very few students who drink this often.
Over time, a slight decrease in the past 30 days’ smoking may be noticed, the total average prevalence rate having dropped by four percentage points between 1995 and 2007 in ESPAD countries with comparable data for all four waves.
If the comparison is confined to the period between 1999 and 2007, the drop in relatively recent smoking is seven percentage points.
A small overall gender gap (4 percentage points) was noticed in 1995 but this gap had vanished in 2007.
Only four countries give a contrary image regarding the longterm downward trend in recent smoking, displaying higher levels in 2007 than in 1995.
In all those countries, however, the actual increases took place already between 1995 and 1999 and the situation has been relatively stable thereafter.
Hence, the overall picture of the trend in past 30 days smoking in the ESPAD countries is one of a decrease, or at least of a stabilized situation.
The total amount of alcohol consumed during the last drinking day is usually low in countries where the students drink often, for example in Greece, and the other way around for countries with low consumption frequencies.
Countries with such a pattern include the Nordic countries Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.
However, there are exceptions to this pattern and they include Denmark (limited comparability) and Austria in which the students report high frequencies as well as large quantities consumed.
In the countries with the largest average quantities, Denmark (limited comparability) and the Isle of Man, the quantities for an average student is about 3–4 times higher than in the countries with the lowest average consumption (Armenia and Cyprus).
Summary
In nearly all countries boys drink larger quantities than girls. The most pronounced contrast to this is Iceland, where girls report larger quantities than boys.
In a large majority of the countries, beer is the dominant beverage among boys while spirits is the most important beverage among girls in a little more than half of the countries.
pattern than the question about intoxication.
Some countries score high on both measures, for example Denmark (limited comparability), the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom.
However, there are countries in which many students report heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days, while they were rather low on the ranking list for drunkenness for the same period.
Examples of such countries include Malta, Portugal, Estonia and Latvia.
All in all, beer is the dominant beverage, accounting for some 40 % of the amount consumed (in 100 % alcohol) on the last drinking day, and followed by 30 % for spirits and 13 % for wine.
Beer is even more dominant among boys, accounting for about half their total consumption on the last drinking day. Girls have a more evenly distributed pattern, with spirits as the most important type, constituting about one third of the total consumption.
On average 43 % of the ESPAD students reported heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days, and this was more common among boys (47 %) than among girls (39 %).
Boys also dominated in a large majority of the countries.
In some few the figures were about the same, but there are also countries in which more girls than boys stated this.
The most striking example is Norway in which 42 % of the girls and 35 % of the boys reported heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days.
On the country level there is a strong positive relationship between reported alcohol consumption for the last drinking day and the perceived level of intoxication on that day.
Thus, in countries where students reported that they consumed larger quantities of alcohol they also reported higher levels of intoxication.
In the latter period this is especially true among girls, with an increase from 35 to 42 %.
In 1995 heavy episodic drinking was on average much more common among boys than girls, but this gap had diminished substantially in 2007.
Countries with a continuing upward trend between all four data collections include Croatia, the Czech Republic, Malta, Portugal and the Slovak Republic.
On average, half of the ESPAD students have been intoxicated at least once during their lifetime, to the point of staggering when walking, having slurred speech or throwing up.
For 39 % of the students this had happened during the past 12 months and for 18 % during the past 30 days.
There were gender differences in the frequencies of drunkenness within countries, with higher figures for boys in some countries and for girls in others, while on the average ESPAD level there were no gender differences.
Increases in the recent period are found in more than half of the countries.
The most pronounced increase between 2003 and 2007 is found in Portugal, where the proportion of students reporting heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days increased from 25 to 56 %, i.e. by 31 percentage points.
Other countries with large increases include Poland (which returned close to the 1999 level after a drop in 2003) (16 percentage points), France (15), Croatia (14) and Bulgaria (12).
Countries with many students that have been drunk during the past 12 months usually have high figures for drunkenness during the past 30 days.
Countries in which many students report drunkenness this often include Denmark (limited comparability), the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom and Austria, with figures from 49 to 31 % for past 30 days drunkenness.
Countries on the other end of the scale include Armenia (2 %) and Cyprus (9 %).
Another way of measuring drunkenness has been to ask how often the students had been consuming five drinks or more per occasion.
This measure of ‘heavy episodic drinking’ shows to some extent a different
A number of students reported problems during the past 12 months related to their alcohol consumption.
On the average level 15 % answered that they had experienced serious problems with parents and the figure was about the same (13 %) for ‘performed poorly at school or work’, ‘serious problems with friends’ and ‘physical fights’. Countries in which many

Other drugs inquired about, but not included in the illicit drugs-index, are magic mushrooms, GHB and anabolic steroids.
Lifetime use of magic mushrooms was reported by 3 % while GHB and steroids were mentioned by 1 %, which is of the same magnitude as reported experience of intravenous drug use.
students reported problems related to their alcohol consumption include Bulgaria, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom and Latvia.
On the country level there is a positive correlation between problems experienced and intoxication during the past 30 days.
Most alcohol-related problems are on average more common among boys. This is most pronounced in the case of ‘physical fights’ and ‘trouble with the police’.
However, for some of the problems the averages are about the same and for one (‘serious problems with friends’) it is even slightly higher among girls.
Since cannabis is being the most frequently used illicit drug, it is worthwhile taking a closer look at this substance. Use of cannabis in the past 12 months was reported by 14 % of all students while use in the past 30 days was stated by 9 % of the boys and 6 % of the girls (7 % mean).
In the two top-prevalence countries (the Czech Republic and the Isle of Man) one in six students reported cannabis use in the past 30 days, indicating more regular cannabis consumption in those countries.
Only 1–2 % in Armenia, the Faroe Islands, Finland, Norway, Romania and Sweden reported such recent use. High-prevalence countries are most often found in western Europe.
One-third of the students in the ESPAD countries find cannabis readily available.
Boys consider cannabis slightly more easily obtainable than girls do, though the gender difference is fairly small.
Amphetamines and ecstasy are not considered as readily available as cannabis.
In most countries, but not all, more boys than girls have used cannabis in the past 30 days, especially in high-prevalence countries.
Countries where many students report past 30 days cannabis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try cannabis, but without doing so.
On average, 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illicit drugs at least once during their lifetime according to the 2007 survey.
The term ‘any illicit drug’ includes cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, crack, ecstasy, LSD and heroin. Reported use of illicit drugs varies considerably across the countries.
In the Czech Republic, almost half (46 %) of the students report such use and relatively many students (roughly a third) did so also in France, the Isle of Man, the Slovak Republic and Switzerland.
Only around 6 % reported illicit drug use in Cyprus, the Faroe Islands, Norway and Romania. Lower prevalence rates are often found among the Nordic countries and in eastern Europe.
The relatively high prevalence rates of cannabis use among young people in Europe raises the question of its potential negative consequences for the individual and the society.
By analysing the optional CAST-scale module the risk of cannabis-related problems was estimated in the 17 ESPAD countries providing such data.
Overall, one out of seven past-year cannabis users (14 %) was classified as having a high risk of developing cannabis-related problems, and the average prevalence of high-risk users across countries was 2 %.
Country specific differences in the risk of harm from cannabis were found, and the percentage of high-risk users in a population corresponds to the cannabis use prevalence rates in the single countries.
In other words, at population level the prevalence of high-risk users increases with the prevalence of cannabis use.
In those ESPAD countries with comparable data for all four waves, 12 % of the students reported lifetime prevalence of illicit drugs in 1995 and this figure rose
The vast majority of the students who have tried illicit drugs have used cannabis.
Lifetime cannabis use was reported by 19 % of the students while 7 % had tried one or more of the other drugs included in the index.
Ecstasy, cocaine and amphetamines follows in a split second place (3 % each) and less commonly reported were LSD, crack and heroin (1–2 %).
Bulgaria, Estonia, the Isle of Man, Latvia and the Slovak Republic are among the top-five countries regarding lifetime ecstasy use in 2007 (prevalence rates around 6–7 %).
while the lowest levels are reported by students from Armenia, Austria, Russia and the United Kingdom (0–2 %).
On average, slightly more girls than boys report nonprescribed use of these drugs (8 % versus 5 %) and in the top eight countries, twice as many girls as boys did so.
In about half of the countries there is no gender difference to speak of however.
The overall trend is fairly stable between 1995 and 2007, and this is true looking at the genders separately, as well as for individual countries.
Even though the overall trend between 2003 and 2007 is downward, a handful of countries display increases for 2007.
In Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points (1995–2007), while the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Malta also display an overall upward trend when the period is considered all in all.
It could be noted that even though Estonia and the United Kingdom are on the same prevalence level in 2007 (about 28 %), they have reached that point from opposite directions; an increase from 8 % in 1995 in the case of Estonia and a decrease from 42 % in that of the United Kingdom.
Having used alcohol together with pills (‘medicaments’) in order to get high was reported by 6 % on average in 2007.
Slightly more girls than boys did so (8 versus 5 %).
This variable shows some similarities with the other one concerning use of pharmaceutical drugs mentioned above.
Firstly, the proportion of students stating lifetime prevalence for these two variables is more or less of the same magnitude.
Secondly, this behaviour is fairly stable over time, at least on average in those countries with data available for all four waves (with the exception of upward trends found in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and downward trends in Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom).
Third and finally, this is another of the very few variables where the girls are in a constant majority over time.
During 1995–2007 the girls are about four percentage points above the boys.
Top-prevalence country for lifetime alcohol use together with pills in 2007 is the Czech Republic (18 %) and particularly low levels are notable for Armenia and Ukraine (1 %).
Since there is a high co-variation between illicit drug use and cannabis use on the country level, quite naturally the development for lifetime cannabis use is more or less the same as described for all illicit drugs above.
Boys display slightly higher rates of relatively recent cannabis use and the gender gap does not change over the period in question.
The overall impression is that the increase in illicit drug use between 1995 and 2003 noted among the ESPAD countries has at least come to a halt, if not a decrease, especially considering that there are no increases in any country for recent use of cannabis between 2003 and 2007.
Nonprescribed lifetime use of tranquillisers or sedatives is most commonly reported in Poland, Lithuania, France and Monaco — where about 15 % of the students indicated such use in the 2007 survey —
Students from Cyprus, the Isle of Man, Malta and Slovenia report the highest lifetime prevalence of inhalants in 2007 (16 %), while only 3 % mention this in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Ukraine.
The average for lifetime use of inhalants for all ESPAD countries is 9 % and there are no gender differences on the aggregate level.
The rates for use in the past 12 months and in the past 30 days follow that for lifetime use relatively well across countries.
No typical geographic pattern is observed — the highest rates of inhalant use are reported from different parts of Europe.
The lifetime prevalence figures remain relatively stable over the period 1995–2007 among countries with data for all four waves.
Summary opposite development is notable for Finland and the Slovak Republic (6 points up).
roughly ten times more students in the Isle of Man report drunkenness in the past 12 months, lifetime cannabis use or use of any other drug than cannabis, compared to Armenian students.
It is well known that, on the individual level, there is often a relationship between the use of different substances.
In the 2007 data, there are apparent associations between the use of different substances at the aggregate country level, and it can be concluded that in countries where many students report recent (past 30 days) alcohol use and intoxication, more students are likely to report experience of illicit drugs, inhalants and use of alcohol together with pills, and vice versa.
Nonprescribed use of tranquillisers or sedatives however shows no correlations on the aggregate country level with use of the substances just mentioned.
Five out of the seven countries mentioned above for scoring high on the keyvariables are bordering each other and are located relatively centrally in Europe.
The other two, the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom, are bordering each other and not that distant from the other high-prevalence countries.
Six countries (or seven if the Faroe Islands are included) were mentioned above for displaying low prevalence rates on the key variables.
Those countries do not cluster. On the contrary; they are located relatively distant from each other and spread throughout Europe.
With the exception of Romania, the low prevalence countries are located on the borders of the European continent.
Nine key variables were selected to give an overview of the 2007 results per country: consumption of any alcoholic beverage during the past 12 months, having been drunk during the past 12 months, alcohol volume (100 % alc.) consumed on the latest drinking day, cigarette smoking during the past 30 days, lifetime use of marijuana or hashish (cannabis), lifetime use of any illicit drug other than cannabis, lifetime use of inhalants, lifetime use of nonprescribed tranquillisers or sedatives and lifetime use of alcohol together with pills in order to get high.
The overall substance-use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the variable in focus.
A decrease for cigarette use in the past 30 days is observable for the whole period. The gender difference was four percentage points in 1995, but this small gap has completely vanished in 2007.
The upward trend between 1995 and 2003 in lifetime use of illicit drugs — predominantly cannabis — has come to a halt; the 2007 figure is three percentage points below that for 2003.
Alcohol use in the past 12 months, nonprescribed lifetime use of tranquillisers or sedatives, lifetime use of alcohol together with pills and lifetime use of inhalants display hardly any changes at all over all four waves.
No changes in gender differences are apparent for illicit drugs or the other substances mentioned.
Individual country prevalence rates for the keyvariables are compared to the averages for all countries.
The countries that score above or around average for most of the nine measures are Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark (limited comparability), Germany (7 Bundesländer), the Isle of Man, the Slovak Republic and the United Kingdom.
The countries with results mostly around or below average are Armenia, Cyprus, Greece, Iceland, Portugal and Romania.
The Faroe Islands could also be included in the list, even though it lacks information for two of the variables.
An upward trend is notable, however, for heavy episodic drinking throughout 1995–2007 (9 percentage points increase), mostly explained by the increasing prevalence rates reported among girls in a number of countries.
Most measures on substance use show a recent (2003–2007) stable or slightly downward trend on average, except for heavy episodic drinking.
Two geographically distant countries, Armenia and the Isle of Man, are the ones most distant regarding substance use.
For all key variables compared, Armenian students report levels well below average while the Isle of Man students are well above average for all measures but two. For instance,
Hence, the overall impression of the longterm changes in substance use among the ESPAD students, based on countries with such data, is one of an

Summary western Europe and countries displaying increases are often found in eastern Europe.
This is particularly true for recent increases between 2003 and 2007.
Regarding recent changes, students in Belgium (Flanders), Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom often tend to report decreased levels of substance use for many of the variables.
A more mixed development is apparent in France, Portugal and Slovenia, where the alcohol variables show upward trends concurrently several drops for other substances such as illicit drug use.
A contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia (Moscow), where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illicit drug use is rising.
To sum up, trend developments over the 12 years of the ESPAD project indicate a fall in smoking in a majority of the countries.
The situation is more or less unchanged as regards alcohol use in the past 12 months and the past 30 days.
On the other hand, heavy episodic drinking shows a small but continuous increase throughout the period.
Use of illicit drugs is still dominated by cannabis use.
Four out of the six countries that had the highest prevalence for cannabis in 2003 show a decline in 2007, and not a single country displays an increase for recent (past 30 days) use of cannabis. The overall impression regarding illicit drug use is that the upward trend between 1995 and 2003 now has come to a halt, with a slightly lower figure in 2007 than in 2003.
Countries displaying rather more upward than downward longterm trends are the Czech and Slovak Republics.
The fourth ESPAD data collection in 2007 gave a lot of new and important information about changes in students’ substance use.
The more data collections that follow in the future, the more clearly the trends will be pictured. We are already looking forward to the next survey, to see whether the trend shift in illicit drug use and the drop in cigarette consumption will continue and whether heavy episodic drinking will continue to be more common.
The next data collection will be of interest not only for this reason but also because it will be the first follow-up study of the new countries (Armenia and Monaco) as well as for the five new countries that participated in the extra data collection in 2008.
We hope that still more European countries will join in the next survey, in addition to the over 40 countries that are part of the ESPAD project already.

This is the 11th annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, available this year in 23 European languages.
Looking back across the reports issued by the agency over the years, it is hard not to be struck by the growth in the level of detail in the information now available — reflecting a more complex situation both in the use of illicit drugs in Europe and in the way Europe responds to the drug problem.
and tangible progress has been made. This has meant that European policymakers have had to make difficult choices, and they have largely done so after carefully studying the available evidence.
Such a policy perspective should be applauded.
The global debate on the drug problem is not short on rhetoric regarding the need for a balanced and evidence-based approach.
In Europe, perhaps more than anywhere else, this rhetoric has become reality.
Despite differences between our Member States in the details of the drug problems they each face and in their priorities for action, there is common agreement on the importance of sharing information and cooperating in order to reduce the supply of drugs as well as on the need to balance supply reduction activities with demand reduction measures, and there is a growing consensus regarding the need to be guided by the evidence in making hard choices about what programmes and actions are in the best interests of our citizens.
This European approach is manifested not only in the new European drug strategy, but also in the national drug strategies that our Member States have adopted, in the stronger and more unified voice that emerges from Europe on this issue, and in the work of the EMCDDA as we strive to play our part in facilitating informed policymaking by providing an unbiased and scientifically rigorous analysis of the information available on the drug phenomenon in Europe.
The information available to support our analysis has grown considerably.
This year’s report is based on data from the 25 EU Member States and Norway and, where available, from Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
Not only has the number of countries providing information increased, but the amount of comparable information available from each has continued to grow.
This information provides us with a far more detailed picture of the European drug situation and its dynamics than ever before.
It is the EMCDDA’s task to explore this complexity, drawing together common experiences where they exist as well as commenting on differences.
In investing in data collection and collaborating in the work of the centre, our Member States have come to understand that their neighbours’ problems today may become their own problems tomorrow.
This awareness is evidenced in the new European Union drug strategy and its accompanying action plans, which are underpinned by consensus on the importance of collecting and sharing information; the need to identify and disseminate good practice; and the value of cooperation and coordinated action in response to the common threat to the health, well-being and security of our citizens posed by drugs.
Drug use is a complex issue, and it is not one that lends itself to simple conclusions.
However, one conclusion does clearly emerge from the European experience — we have learned that working together not only works but is also indispensable if we are to develop effective responses to the challenges presented to us by the use of illicit drugs.
Marcel Reimen Chairman, EMCDDA Management Board
A reflection on the information available also reminds us of the need for continued vigilance and of the dangers of complacency.
Warning notes are sounded in this report in respect of drugrelated HIV infections and drugrelated deaths.
Nonetheless, in Europe as a whole, a tremendous effort has been made to address these sorts of problems,

Introductory note
This annual report is based on information provided to the EMCDDA by the EU Member States and candidate countries and Norway (participating in the work of the EMCDDA since 2001) in the form of a national report.
The statistical data reported here relate to the year 2004 (or the last year available).
Graphics and tables in this report may reflect a subset of EU countries: the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest.
An online version of the annual report is available in 23 languages and may be found at http://annualreport.emcdda.europa.eu
The 2006 statistical bulletin (http://stats06.emcdda.europa.eu) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based.
It also provides further details on the methodology used and over 100 additional statistical graphs.
Country data profiles (http://dataprofiles06.emcdda.europa.eu) provide a top-level, graphical summary of key aspects of the drug situation for each country.

Commentary — the drug problem in Europe
A continuing trend, again evident in the new information reported this year, is for changes to national drug laws to emphasise more strongly a distinction between offences of drug possession for personal use and those involving trafficking and supply.
Generally, there is a shift towards increased penalties for the latter and a reduced emphasis on custodial sentences for the former.
This development is in line with a greater emphasis overall across Europe on widening the opportunities for drug treatment and on giving more attention to interventions that divert those with drug problems away from the criminal justice system towards treatment and rehabilitation options.
For those countries that have made a legal distinction with respect to the possession of drugs for use rather than supply, the question arises whether there is an explicit need to legislate on what quantities of drugs constitute a threshold for personal use.
Here no consensus currently prevails and different approaches have been adopted across Europe, ranging from the issuing of general operational guidelines through to specification of legal limits.
Although defining national drug policies remains the prerogative of individual European Member States, there is now strong agreement on the benefits that can accrue from working together at the European level.
This can be seen in a number of recent developments that support coordination and cooperation activities.
Among these developments are the coming into force in 2005 of two new EC regulations on precursors and a Council decision on new drugs.
In addition, measures against drug trafficking are strengthened by new legal instruments to address money laundering and confiscation of assets.
However, the development that is most central to shaping European collaboration and future actions on the drug issue is the new EU drug strategy for 2005–12 and its two accompanying action plans.
In the first of these, around 100 planned specific actions are detailed by EU Member States to be implemented by 2008.
A continuous programme of evaluation is envisaged for the strategy, with annual progress reviews and impact assessments at the end of each of the two action plan periods.
Data presented in this report show that across Europe as a whole the historical focus on heroin use and injecting as the central elements of the drug problem needs to be widened because of the increasing importance of polydrug use and stimulant use and the growing public health implications of widespread cannabis use.
Nevertheless, in many countries opioids (largely heroin) remain the principal drugs for which clients seek treatment, accounting for about 60 % of all recorded treatment requests in 2004 — and among these clients just over half (53 %) reported injecting the drug.
Nearly 25 % of opioid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more, with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20.
It should be noted that treatment demand data reflect the number of clients requesting treatment during the reported year and do not include people continuing in treatment; consequently the total number of clients in treatment is considerably higher.
Across Europe as a whole, the substantial growth in drug substitution treatment that has occurred in recent years means that the treatment system
The strategy can be seen as representing a European consensus on how the drug problem should be addressed.
There is an explicit commitment to a balanced approach combining both supply- and demand-side measures, matched by an acceptance of the need to base actions on the evidence of effectiveness and, furthermore, to systematically evaluate progress.
Important policy differences between European Member States still exist, often reflecting differences in the national drug situations and in the configuration of responses.
Nonetheless, the new drug strategy suggests that the European policy debate on drugs is increasingly characterised by agreement on a common framework for activities.
For example, virtually all demand reduction strategies include prevention, treatment and harm reduction elements, although the emphasis on each varies between Member States.
Some policy options continue to generate considerable debate — but in general this is against a background of broad agreement on the fundamentals that underpin the European response to the drug problem.
Annual report 2006: the state of the drugs problem in Europe includes an increasing, and ageing, population of people with heroin problems, who are likely to require care and remain major consumers of resources for many years to come.
available suggests a general decrease in drug injection over the longer term.
However, in many of the new Member States injecting rates remain high.
An important caveat here is that the availability of national or subnational estimates of drug injecting is poor.
Moreover, studies of injecting in some regions have even reported slight increases recently.
The most comprehensive picture of this behaviour comes from monitoring heroin users in treatment, among whom the proportion of injectors has declined dramatically in some countries, but not in others.
Notably, among the old Member States, Denmark, Greece, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom all report declining rates of injecting among heroin users in treatment.
Heroin consumed in Europe is manufactured predominantly in Afghanistan.
Europe continues to account for the greatest quantities of heroin seized worldwide, and, as a result of an increase in seizures in south-eastern European countries (particularly Turkey), this region has surpassed western and central Europe in terms of volume intercepted.
This rising trend in heroin seizures not only underlines the value of coordinated action against trafficking at the wider European level but also raises important questions about the impact of increased heroin production on the European market.
No clear trends are visible with respect to average purity; however, the five-year price trend (1999–2004) corrected for inflation is downwards in most countries.
Nevertheless, although heroin is more readily available and cheaper in Europe, there is no evidence yet that this is influencing overall levels of consumption.
Overall indicators would suggest that the incidence of new heroin use is still declining in Europe within what is probably a stable situation — with a significant proportion of those with opioid problems now receiving substitution treatment, at least in some countries.
Among those new to treatment, the numbers with a primary opioid problem have been decreasing in most countries.
Nonetheless, this is an area where waves of epidemic use have been seen in the past, and therefore complacency must be avoided.
The relationship between drug injecting and health problems is well known, and drug injectors have a high risk of overdose and serious infection as well as other health problems such as septicaemia and thrombosis.
HIV infection is the health risk that has galvanised the European public health response to this form of drug use, and almost all countries now have interventions aimed at preventing new infections.
For example, needle and syringe provision, once regarded as a controversial intervention, is available to some degree in virtually all Member States, although the coverage varies considerably between countries.
Most countries report low rates of newly diagnosed HIV infection attributable to drug injecting, and HIV infection rates among injectors are estimated to be below 5 %.
However, again important caveats should be borne in mind: first, two of the largest countries most affected by AIDS among drug injectors, Spain and Italy, currently do not provide national HIV case reporting data; and, second, it is reported that HIV transmission is continuing to occur in specific injecting groups across Europe, and there are even signs of increases in some of the population groups studied.
In this year’s report, there are worrying indicators that the number of drugrelated deaths, which has generally declined since 2000, increased slightly in a majority of countries in 2004.
It is too early to judge whether these small changes herald a long-term shift, but it must be remembered that drugrelated deaths represent one of the major public health consequences of illicit drug use.
Even though the proportion of drugrelated deaths occurring in young people has been falling, supporting suggestions that new heroin injecting is declining, available city-based estimates of drugrelated mortality (overdose and other causes) suggest that currently 10–23 % of overall mortality among adults aged 15–49 can be attributed to opioid use.
Injecting and injecting-related health problems: a constant companion
In many countries, drug injecting is almost synonymous with heroin use, but there are exceptions, with a few EU countries reporting significant levels of stimulant injecting, mostly among heavy users of amphetamines.
Mirroring to some extent the picture for heroin, overall the information
A far more negative picture presents itself for rates of infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which remain almost universally high among drug injectors.
Treating the HCV-related health problems among drug injectors and ex-injectors is likely to remain a major health cost for many years to come.
In drawing the conclusion that drug injecting may be slowly declining and that Europe has responded well to the challenge posed by the epidemic spread of HIV in the 1990s, there is a real danger that this may lead to complacency about the health threats still posed by this behaviour.
Cocaine: signs of stability for Europe’s second most common illicit drug
(Note that these estimates relate to the adult population and are the most recent estimates available.
For complete data and full methodological notes see the accompanying statistical bulletin.)
Lifetime prevalence: at least 65 million, or one in fi ve European adults
Last year use: 22.5 million European adults or one third of lifetime users
Overall range 0.8 % to 11.3 %
Estimates of cocaine use (last year prevalence) now place the drug slightly ahead of amphetamine and ecstasy as Europe’s second most used illicit drug.
However, the general picture is one of stabilisation in levels of use after a period in which users of the drug increased considerably in number.
The large increases in cocaine prevalence experienced by Spain and the United Kingdom from the mid to late 1990s seem to have stabilised since 2000 or 2001.
Elsewhere, while some moderate increases in levels of cocaine use have been noted in a few countries, dramatic increases are not being reported.
Overall, the cocaine situation remains very heterogeneous in Europe and significant cocaine use is restricted to a few, mainly western European, countries.
Last year use: 3.5 million European adults or one third of lifetime users
Last year use: 3 million or one third of lifetime users
Country variation in last year use:
Typical range 0.3 % to 1.5 % (15 countries)
It would be wrong to conclude that the signs of stabilisation in use of cocaine will necessarily result in a stabilisation in the extent of problems attributed to use of this drug.
In Europe, cocaine use is at historically high levels, and studies suggest that it is a common pattern for increases in problems relating to a drug to lag some years behind increases in prevalence.
This is because it takes time for intensive and regular patterns of drug use to develop and for problems to become visible.
This may be beginning to happen in those European countries where cocaine use is now well established.
In both the Netherlands and Spain, at least one in four treatment demands is now reported to be cocaine related, and overall in Europe new treatment demands for cocaine roughly doubled between 1999 and 2004.
Although the use of crack cocaine remains very limited in Europe, reports of problems from some cities suggest that the situation may be deteriorating.
Almost 7 000 acute drug deaths, with opioids being found in around 70 % of them (2003 data)
More than half a million opioid users received substitution treatment in 2003
Cocaine is often found in the toxicological analysis of deaths attributed to opioid drugs, and in a number of countries concurrent cocaine use has become a recognised problem for those treating heroin problems.
Although data are limited, in the 2005 national reports over 400 deaths were identified as being causally related to cocaine use, and cocaine-related deaths appeared to be increasing in all highprevalence countries.
Annual report 2006: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Drug use in Europe cheaper than ever before data suggest that in Europe as a whole the cost of buying drugs has fallen.
For most countries, the predominant five-year trend has been a decline in street price for cannabis, heroin, amphetamine, ecstasy and cocaine (see graphic below).
Although historical data on street prices are largely lacking and difficult to interpret when available, worryingly this recent trend accords with the suggestion that prices may have been declining over the longer term.
For example, information available from some of the highprevalence countries suggests that cocaine and ecstasy were considerably more expensive in the late 1980s and early 1990s than they are today.
In this report, for the first time, a five-year analysis of the street prices of illicit drugs is included, corrected for inflation to allow a more accurate assessment of changes in the street price of illicit drugs over time.
Data on street prices are difficult both to collect and to interpret.
The purity, quantity and variety of the substance bought all influence price, as do geographical factors such as living in a big city or on a regular drug transit route.
Drug prices also vary considerably between countries and are subject to fluctuations over time that reflect disruptions in supply.
The trends represent the available information on national streetlevel prices for each drug in the EU Member States and Norway, weighted by country population sizes to form an overall European trend.
Prices have been adjusted for national inflation rates (base year 1999) and all series indexed to a base of 100 in 1999.
Many countries cannot supply these data, which are difficult to obtain and often unreliable and incomplete.
Countries missing drug price information for two or more consecutive years are not included in the trend calculations for the drug: the trend for heroin brown is based on 9 countries, amphetamine on 9, cocaine on 13, ecstasy on 13, herbal cannabis on 13, and cannabis resin on 14.
Additionally, where 2004 data are missing (11 cases) 2003 prices are used; for missing 1999 data (1 case) 2000 prices are used; data missing for other years (12 cases) have been interpolated from adjacent years.

Responding to a more complex European drug problem appropriate intervention for problem heroin use is matched by a growing need to develop the same clarity on how we respond to a more heterogeneous European drug problem.
The need better to define and understand polydrug use
A common theme running through this report is the increasing need to develop responses that are sensitive to the complex and multifaceted nature of today’s drug problem.
When prevention, treatment or harm reduction activities are considered, there is a need to better understand what constitutes good practice and evidence-based action.
Among the total of approximately 380 000 treatment demands reported in 2004, cannabis was the primary reason for referral to treatment in about 15 % of all cases, making it the next most commonly reported drug after heroin.
Treatment services are also dealing with more stimulant and polydrug problems, including a considerable overlap of illicit drug and alcohol problems.
However, at the population level we do not know enough about the public health implications of regular and persistent use of these types of drugs, nor about the likely intervention needs of those who use them.
The evidence base in Europe for determining the response to drug problems is strongest for responding to the problem of illicit opioid use, where a considerable body of evidence supports the development and targeting of services. The growing consensus that exists to guide policy on what is likely to constitute
This year’s report devotes space to presenting the analytical issues that must be addressed if Europe is to meet the challenge of better understanding the needs of the increasing number of individuals whose problems stem from the use of a range of drugs rather than a dependency on a single substance.
Back to the future: anticipating threats and challenges
In this year’s report, as always, an attempt is made to identify emerging trends to anticipate future problems.
Such analysis is by definition speculative and must be made with caution. A drug clearly associated with severe public health problems is methamphetamine.
While globally methamphetamine problems continue to grow, within Europe the drug remains restricted to a few countries with long-established problems.
Although the available information does not permit us to draw any firm conclusion on trends, more countries are reporting seizures or use of the drug, clearly emphasising the need for more intensive monitoring of those population groups most at risk.
In 2006, the EMCDDA published a technical paper on hallucinogenic mushrooms, and this issue is again summarised in our annual reporting.
The availability and use of hallucinogenic mushrooms appears to have been increasing since the late 1990s but to a large extent has passed unnoticed.
For the most part, use of this type of drug appears to be experimental and reports of problems remain rare.
However, a growing awareness among policymakers of the availability of hallucinogenic mushrooms has led to the introduction of some actions to increase control measures.
Psilocybin and psilocin, two of the psychoactive substances found in hallucinogenic mushrooms, are controlled by an international convention.
However, the fact that mushrooms grow naturally in many countries poses a more complex issue for legislation, and they are treated differently across Europe.
More generally, vigilance on emerging substances that may pose a threat to public health and therefore require control is supported by a new Council decision (2005/387/JHA) on information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances.
An example of the need for early-warning information in this area has been the rapid spread of mCPP (1-3-chlorophenyl piperazine) in 2005.
The emergence of mCPP illustrates the fact that those involved in the production of illicit drugs are constantly looking for innovation in the form of new chemicals that can be introduced to the market — in this case probably to potentiate or modify the effects of MDMA (ecstasy).
Such innovation requires a response as the potential for these substances to cause severe health problems is unknown.
The early-warning system put in place by the Council decision therefore represents an important mechanism to intervene in a process in which the health of young Europeans is put at risk by those who pursue profit by avoiding existing drug control mechanisms.

National strategy
During the reporting period, national drug strategies and action plans were adopted by five countries (Table 1).
Latvia adopted a national drug strategy for the first time, for the period 2005–08, while new national drug strategies and plans were adopted in the Czech Republic, Spain, Luxembourg and Romania.
National strategic plan and action plan
In addition, Finland adopted a drug strategy for the prison administration (2005–06), and in the United Kingdom public service agreements (PSAs) set out new objectives and targets in the field of drug policy aimed at reducing the harm caused by illegal drugs to individuals, their families and the community.
During the reporting period, national drug strategies were under preparation in Italy, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and Norway (Table 2).
group recommended that ‘priorities and objectives should be defined more clearly by the governments’, that ‘a clear definition of the basic principles of a common drug policy should take place’ and that ‘a chronology of the chosen strategies should be identified’.
The 2005–06 action plan in the Czech Republic follows a similar direction, specifying concrete goals and the activities needed to meet them, and setting out the responsibilities of individual ministers and the terms and indicators of fulfilment for each field.
Many European countries automatically renew their national drug strategies, setting in motion a cyclical process in which the results of the previous strategy, or its evaluation, provide input for the future strategy (EMCDDA, 2004a).
Some countries, having first implemented national drug strategies and action plans some time ago (1998 onwards), are now reformulating their strategies or plans, placing greater emphasis on setting clearer and more feasible objectives.
For example, Luxembourg reports that its new action plan 2005–09 is simple, clearly structured and output oriented, setting objectives for actions, identifying responsibilities and specifying budgets, anticipated outcomes and deadlines for outcome and evaluation.

National drug strategy
During 2005, such a process was reported by Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary and Romania. Evaluation of the implementation of the Hungarian strategy to combat the drug problem was undertaken externally by the Dutch Trimbos Institute, the first time that a country’s drug strategy has been assessed by foreign experts.
There are similarities with the 2004 evaluation of the 1999 Portuguese national drug strategy and the 2001–04 action plan, conducted externally by the Portuguese National Institute for Public Administration and internally by the Institute for Drugs and Addiction (IDT).

Hungary and Portugal are the first two countries in Europe to have requested external assessment of their national drug strategies.
priority is now given to coordination and cooperation between stakeholders in the field of drugs, resulting in improvements in these areas.
There have also been developments in both the types and accessibility of treatment available for drug addicts.
In the United Kingdom, the Audit Commission, while acknowledging progress in drug treatment, suggested that there remains room for improvement in facilities for reintegration and rehabilitation of drug users, such as housing, social care and other support services.
In the future, the government’s success in achieving the aims of the drug strategy will be measured against targets set out in the PSAs, and by a drug harm index (DHI), which will assess the harms generated by problem use of any illegal drug.
In 2005, the mid-term review of the Irish drug strategy 2001–08, based on a public consultation process and analysis of key national and EU data, recommended ‘refocusing’ priorities in order to address emerging trends in treatment, polydrug use, cocaine use and the spread of HIV and hepatitis C and ‘re-energising’ the roll-out and implementation of various key actions during the remaining period of the strategy.
And in Romania, the national drug strategy 2003–04 was evaluated with the participation of all state institutions involved in the field of drugs with the findings forming the basis for the new national drug strategy 2005–12.
In Luxembourg, 87 % of the measures set out in the 2000–04 national drug action plan have been implemented within the specified deadlines.
It is reported that the measures not introduced (e.g. a heroin distribution programme) have been delayed mainly for political reasons.
Actions not yet implemented have been included in the new action plan.
Drugrelated public expenditure
Furthermore, reports over the last year suggest that national drug strategies are beginning to have visible effects.
While it is not yet possible to say definitively that the overall aims of reducing demand and supply have been achieved, there is no doubt that national drug strategies have reached specific and important targets.
Although expenditure is frequently measured over differing time periods, and there is no common definition of drugrelated public expenditure, available estimates suggest that drug spending has increased in several countries, including the Czech Republic, Denmark, Luxembourg, Austria and Poland.
Countries reporting drug expenditure for the year 2004 included the Czech Republic (EUR 11.0 million), Spain (EUR 302 to 325 million), Cyprus (EUR 2.8 million), Poland (EUR 51 million) and Norway (EUR 46 million).
Two countries reported more recent budgeted expenditure for tackling drugs: Luxembourg (EUR 6 million in 2005) and the United Kingdom (EUR 2 billion in 2004/05).
Evaluation of the Portuguese drug strategy adopted in 1999 attributes to it an increase in the availability of drug treatment, a reduction in drugrelated deaths and HIV prevalence and an increase in police reports for drug trafficking.
On the other hand, it also found that there has been a fall in the age at which people first experiment with drugs and an increase in drugrelated deaths linked to substances other than opioids.
In Spain, the evaluation of national strategy (2003), while recognising that the objective of reducing drug use has not been realised, reveals that good results have been achieved in the areas of assistance and harm reduction, and satisfactory results have been achieved in other areas, such as research and education, international cooperation and supply reduction.
In addition, the Ministry of Health and Consumers’ Affairs has approved an action plan 2005–08 to mobilise resources and implement initiatives with the aim of progressing and revitalising the national drug strategy.
In Ireland, the mid-term review of the national drug strategy, published in June 2005, recognises that ‘a measure of the expenditure is vital to gauge the cost effectiveness of the different elements of the strategy’, and work will commence shortly to estimate police expenditure.

develop and test a model to estimate the costs of drug abuse, and in Belgium a follow-up to a 2004 study on public expenditure was instituted at the end of 2005.
Although sparse, these interesting data show that research on drug expenditure constitutes an increasingly important part of the policy agenda of some Member States.
The EU action plan 2005–08 reflects the EU’s balanced approach to the drug phenomenon, i.e. a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach that considers the issue from every angle: coordination, demand reduction, supply reduction, international cooperation, information, research and evaluation.
Drug supply reduction
At EU level, two action plans adopted in 2005 directly or indirectly create a new frame of reference for the development of EU policy in the field of drugs for the next few years.
First, having examined the Commission’s proposal of February 2005, and taking fully into account the final evaluation of the EU drug strategy and EU action plan (2000–04), the Council endorsed the EU drugs action plan 2005–08 in June 2005.
The new action plan follows the structure and the objectives of the EU drug strategy 2005–12 and lists around 100 specific actions to be implemented by the EU and its Member States by the end of 2008.
Two important activities in the EU in the field of drug supply reduction were characterised by the coming into force, on 18 August 2005, of the two EC regulations on precursors, adopted in 2004.
Controls on chemical precursors are an important aspect of drug supply reduction, as these substances are indispensable in the production of drugs.
Action in this area in the EU takes two forms: first, the regulation of trade in certain substances between the EU and third countries and, second, regulation within the internal market.
Adopted in 1990 to comply with the provision of Article 12 of the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, on precursors control, the first regulation laid down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances (1).
It was replaced in December 2004 by a new regulation with an extended application framework aimed at
2 countering also the manufacture of synthetic drugs (
It is conceived as a continuous, incremental and participative process.
It is continuous because the European Commission, with the support of the EMCDDA and Europol, will present annual progress reviews.
Finally, the process will be participative, involving an evaluation steering group whose task will be to define the methodology, output and provisional calendar.
As in the evaluation of the EU action plan (2000–04), the steering group will be made up of representatives of relevant Commission departments, the EMCDDA and Europol, as well as representatives of the Member States.
Consultative hearings for civil society representatives will also be organised.
At the end of the 2005–08 drug action plan, and for the first time at European level, an impact assessment will be organised with a view to proposing a new action plan for the period 2009–12, which is intended to take this assessment as a starting point. A final evaluation of the strategy and of the action plans will then be carried out by the Commission in 2012.
It has been replaced by a new regulation adopted on 11 February 2004 (4).

substances, with a view to preventing the diversion of such substances.
In particular, it obliges Member States to adopt the necessary measures to enable their competent authorities to perform their control and monitoring duties.
In addition, a regulation laying down rules for implementing these two
5 regulations came into force on 18 August 2005 (
These actions in the area of precursors control complete another part of the important activities of the EU in the field of supply reduction.
Utilising the new opportunities provided since the Maastricht Treaty, the EU has developed a legal framework to combat drug trafficking and to improve law enforcement cooperation.
Several joint actions in this field have been adopted since 1995–96, and more recently a framework decision to harmonise minimum sanctions against drug trafficking and a decision on new psychoactive substances have been adopted (see ‘Action on new drugs’, p. 55).
A framework decision on ‘the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property’ was also adopted by the Council on 24 February 2005.
It aims to ensure that all Member States have in place effective rules governing the confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of criminal offences punishable by deprivation of liberty for more than one year.
EU legislation in this area existed previously but was considered insufficient.
This new framework decision aims to achieve effective cross-border cooperation with regard to confiscation.
The mechanism of confiscation is extended to other crime-related property when the offence was committed within the framework of a criminal organisation and when the offence is covered by one of several other EU framework decisions.
Among these is Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA, which lays down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking.
The Member States shall take the necessary measures to comply with this framework decision by 15 March 2007.
In addition to these legal instruments, a programme for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters has been adopted and implemented.
Agis is a framework programme to help the police, other relevant agencies and the judiciary from the EU Member States and candidate countries cooperate in criminal matters in the fight against crime.
Since 2003, it has helped to fund many projects.
International organised drug production and trafficking and drug precursors diversion are mentioned within the areas of activities and specific topics of the 2006 Agis work programme and call for proposals (which closed in January 2006).
Money laundering and confiscation of assets
There have also been some modifications of legal instruments in the field of money laundering and confiscation.
Directive 91/308 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering (6), adopted in 1991 on the legal basis related to the internal market and modified in 2001, attempted to harmonise legislation in this area among Member States.

Chapter 1: Policies and laws
EMCDDA regulation contrast to the previous offence of possession for own use (defined as no more than one dose), Section 171 creates two offences of possession for own use, depending on the number of doses (see below for details).
Two new penalties can also be imposed for these offences: monitored home imprisonment or community service.
Possession of more than 10 doses must be charged under Section 172, which, depending on the aggravating circumstances, provides for prison sentences ranging from four years to life.
In addition, the age of criminal liability has also been lowered from 15 to 14 years.
The maximum sentence for theft of a large amount of drugs or theft by an organised group has been extended to 15 years.
Finally, on 31 August 2005, the Commission adopted a new proposal for the recasting of the EMCDDA founding regulation.
The new regulation is an important instrument to facilitate the work of the EMCDDA because of the new tasks it defines.
In particular, it allows the EMCDDA to take account of new drug use patterns and emerging trends in polydrug use, including the combined use of licit and illicit psychoactive substances; to develop tools and instruments to help Member States and the EU to monitor and evaluate their drug policies and strategies; and to cooperate with non-EU countries such as the candidates for EU accession or the countries of the western Balkans.
It also contains several changes to the Scientific Committee and the Management Board.
Based on Article 152 TEC, this text must now be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament according to the co-decision procedure.
New national laws
A few countries made major changes to their drug laws in the reporting period concerning both possession and trafficking offences and penalties.
In Italy, recent changes in legislation (February 2006) have reclassified drugs into two main groups rather than six (all substances with no therapeutic use are grouped together, removing any notion of hard and soft drugs); defined the threshold between personal use and trafficking; revised the sanctions to include house arrest and community service; and increased access to the alternatives to prison.
In addition, all drug users now have the right to choose freely the type and location of treatment they receive and the institution that certifies their drug-addicted status, services that are no longer provided exclusively by the public sector.
In Romania, a new law and new penal code introduced distinctions between felonies and misdemeanours (with misdemeanours now punishable mainly by community work and day fines), between users and addicts and between low-risk and high-risk drugs.
Exemption from penalty and postponing the execution of the penalty can now be applied to drug law offences.
Treatment of addicts can now take place through an integrated assistance programme, overseen by a case manager.
In the United Kingdom, the Drugs Act 2005 made a number of substantial amendments to the national legislation including clarifying the classification of fungi containing psilocin or psilocybin as a class A drug; creating the presumption of intent to supply when a specified quantity of controlled drugs is found; allowing police to test drug offenders on arrest, instead of on charge, and requiring those testing positive to undergo assessment for drug use; and requiring courts to take into account aggravating factors (such as supplying drugs near a school) when sentencing.
Courts may also remand in police custody for up to eight days (previously four days) those who swallow drugs packages, and a court or jury may now draw inferences if a person refuses to allow an intimate search or scan without good reason.
In Bulgaria, the new Narcotic Substances and Precursors Control Act was approved in June 2004.
In general, there is a tendency across Europe to reduce or remove custodial penalties for personal use offences and, at the same time, to increase penalties for offences related to
See 2005 annual report (http://ar2005.emcdda.europa.eu/en/page013-en.html).
Several countries legislated on threshold quantities of drugs during the reporting period.
In Bulgaria, the Amendment and Supplement Act of the penal code (new SG 26/04) abolishes Section 354a (3), which exempted addicts from criminal responsibility if they were found in possession of a single dose.
Difficulties in defining the quantity of a single dose and evidence that the exception has been misused in court to benefit drug dealers were among the reasons given for this measure.
In Belgium, following the Constitutional Court’s annulment of Article 16 of the 2003 law, a new joint directive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutors-General dealt with cannabis-related infringements.
It states that the possession of a small amount of cannabis for personal use (no more than three grams or one plant) by an adult should lead to a simple police registration only, if there are no aggravating circumstances.
In Italy, the changes implemented in February 2006 imposed new quantity limits to define the threshold between personal use and trafficking, based on the amount of active principle of the drug, following the removal of such limits in 1993.
Monitoring of sentences given to drug offenders has been discussed or implemented in several countries, and in some cases action has already been taken on the results.
In Ireland, approval has been given for the establishment of a central crime statistics unit to monitor statistics on arrests, prosecutions and the nature of sentences passed, in accordance with the national drug strategy.
From 2002 to 2005, the Max Planck Institute in Germany carried out an evaluation of Section 31a of the German Narcotic Drugs Act, which permits the offence of possession of ‘insignificant quantities’ of drugs to be exempted from prosecution in certain circumstances.
The evaluation found that, in practice, the implementation of Act §31a varies considerably in the 16 Länder of Germany, in part because of different interpretations of ‘insignificant’ (Schäfer and Paoli, 2006).
In March 2005, the Land Berlin passed a revision of its ‘guideline on cannabis’, according to which possession of up to 10 grams of cannabis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled.
This amount can be increased to 15 grams in individual cases.
The Minister of Health of Lithuania amended recommendations on what shall be regarded as small, large and very large amounts of narcotic and psychotropic substances, redefining these quantities.
The United Kingdom Drugs Act 2005 now creates the presumption of intent to supply when a specified quantity of controlled drugs is
The German Narcotic Drugs Act allows the prosecutor to discontinue proceedings for possession of drugs without court approval under certain circumstances. Despite recommendations and guidelines on these, regulations differ significantly between Länder.
The aforementioned study on these differences, carried out for the Ministry of Health, looked at the sentencing of over 1 800 cases in six different Länder (Schäfer and Paoli, 2006).
See ‘The role of the quantity in the prosecution of drug offences’, an ELDD legal report, and Table 1 in ‘Illicit drug use in the EU: legislative approaches’, an
EMCDDA thematic paper (both available at http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/?nnodeid=5175).
Chapter 1: Policies and laws
Other sentencing statistics showed that the waiving of reports as statutory alternatives to punishment increased in 2004, though police reports and convictions increased further, while the number of suspended proceedings dropped slightly.
In the Czech Republic in 2005, regional police headquarters were surveyed for the second consecutive year about drugrelated crime. It was estimated that in 2004 about 62 % of drug production/distribution offences, 25 % of fraud offences, 21 % of crimes involving misappropriation of funds/property and 20 % of ordinary thefts were committed by drug users in order to finance their own consumption (Czech national report).
A survey carried out in 2004 among 15- to 16-year-olds in Finland showed that about 7 % of those who had used cannabis in the last year had financed their use illegally, more than half by selling drugs and the rest mainly by stealing (Kivivuori et al., 2005, cited in the Finnish national report).
In Romania, court sentencing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social reintegration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use. In the majority of cases, the penalty was suspension of the sanction under surveillance.
From 2004, it was noted that the courts less often imposed compulsory treatment, effectively decreasing the involvement of the probation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users.
In Ireland, two studies carried out by the Garda Research Unit in 1996 and 2000/01 among a sample of drug users known to the police estimated that drug users were responsible for 66 % of detected indictable crimes in 1996 and 28 % in 2000/01 (Keogh, 1997; Furey and Browne, 2003, cited in the Irish national report).
to extrapolate from, while others refer only to a specific type of drugrelated crime.
Statistics on sentencing, or avoidance of sentencing, give a far more accurate picture of the implementation of a country’s drug policy than does the text of the laws (see EMCDDA, 2002a).
Action 25.1 of the EU drug action plan 2005–08 foresees the adoption by the Council, by 2007, of a common definition of ‘drugrelated crime’, on the basis of a Commission proposal based on existing studies to be brought forward by the EMCDDA.
Data on ‘reports’ (11) of drug law offences are available in all the European countries analysed in this report.
They reflect differences in national legislation, but also the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced, and differences in the priorities and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences.
In addition, there are variations between national information systems on drug law offences, especially in relation to reporting and recording practices — i.e. what is recorded, when and how.
), it is more appropriate to compare trends rather than absolute numbers.
Although there is as yet no EU definition of drugrelated crime, it is usually considered to mean crimes committed under the influence of drugs, crimes committed to finance drug use, crimes committed in the context of the functioning of illicit drug markets and offences in contravention of drug legislation.
Routine data are available in the EU only on the last type of crime — drug law offences.
Over the five-year period 1999–2004, the number of ‘reports’ of drug law offences increased overall in most EU countries (in fact in all reporting countries except Italy and Portugal, with particularly marked increases — twofold or

In most EU Member States the majority of reported drug law offences (17) are related to drug use or possession for use (18), ranging in 2004 from 61 % of all drug law offences in Poland to 90 % in Austria.
In the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Turkey, most reported drug law offences relate to dealing or trafficking, with the proportion varying from 48 % of all drug offences in Luxembourg to 93 % in the Czech Republic.
offences involving cannabis increased in Germany, Spain, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Bulgaria, while it remained stable overall in Ireland and the Netherlands, and decreased in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Slovenia and Sweden (24).
Over the same five-year period, the number of offences for use/possession for use increased overall in all reporting countries, except Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Turkey, which reported a declining trend (19).
Over the same five-year period, the number of ‘reports’ and/or the proportion of drug law offences involving heroin decreased in the majority of reporting countries, except Belgium, Austria, Slovenia and Sweden, which reported to use/possession for use fell overall (20

Chapter 1: Policies and laws at presenting a first insight into this emerging phenomenon in the European Union.
European drug policies: extended beyond illicit drugs?, in EMCDDA 2006 annual report: selected issues
Although drug strategies do not always refer to licit drugs or addictions, the selected issue finds that prevention programmes and, in some countries, treatment measures apply to both licit and illicit drugs, targeting as a priority children and young people.
A slow integration, strategically or institutionally, of licit drugs into policy and measures against illicit drugs appears to be more and more common.
In Europe, the scope of drug policies is beginning to stretch beyond illicit drugs and to encompass other addictive substances or even types of behaviour.
This is found in the drug policies of some Member States and in EU drug strategies.
Increasingly, research is addressing the issue of addiction or addictive behaviours irrespective of the substances concerned.
The selected issue on the increasing attention being given in national illicit drugs strategies or policy documents to licit substances or to addiction per se aims
Chapter 2Responding to drug problems in Europe — an overview
Prevention health strategies regarding conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder, etc.), social policies (the provision of leisure spaces and support for vulnerable youth or deprived families), education policies (reducing school dropout), etc.
Thus, public health prevention targets the full set of vulnerability factors which are relevant for tackling drug problems by involving services and sectors that would not usually focus on drugs.
Universal school-based prevention
Experiences in some Member States suggest that drug prevention interventions at the individual level may be more effective if also supported by regulatory policies on legal drugs that can limit the access of young people to these substances and reduce their social acceptability.
As a result, environmental prevention strategies that address the normative and cultural framework of substance use are gaining ground in parts of Europe, supported by the first steps taken at EU level: the tobacco advertisement directive and the WHO framework convention on tobacco control (see the section on environmental strategies in the selected issue on drug use in recreational settings).
The role of mass media campaigns is increasingly being seen as one of raising awareness (to underpin, support and explain to the population at large the rationale underlying environmental strategies) rather than one of changing behaviour.
In this regard, a recent German review of the international literature (Bühler and Kröger, 2005, cited in the German national report) recommends that media campaigns be used as a supporting measure and not as the only measure to achieve behavioural changes.
Public health prevention
Programme-based prevention approaches are gaining ground within school-based prevention.
Programme-based prevention implies standardised delivery in a defined number of sessions, each with exactly defined contents, and detailed teacher and pupil material.
This facilitates monitoring and evaluation and increases the accuracy, fidelity and consistency of interventions, leading to high-quality delivery.
As a result, more Member States than before are monitoring school-based prevention interventions (the Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Cyprus, Hungary, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom).
The first ever European drug abuse prevention trial (www.eudap.net) has shown promising results.
Funded by the European Commission, the project was implemented and crossevaluated in seven countries, nine regional centres and 143 schools and involved 7 000 students (3 500 in a trial group and 3 500 in a control group).
EU-Dap reports that, compared with the control group, students in the trial group had a 26 % lower probability of smoking daily, a 35 % lower probability of being frequently drunk and a 23 % lower probability of using cannabis.
A comparable programme-based research approach is Blueprint in the United Kingdom (30).
Additionally, more attention is now given to stricter technical guidance and to better coverage in the implementation of school-based prevention (e.g. in France and Ireland).
Annual report 2006: the state of the drugs problem in Europe four countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg) reporting on new projects in this area.
In Italy, the priority of many projects is now to protect children, mothers and immigrant families or those belonging to ethnic minorities.
Luxembourg reports that special attention is given to young people and to the biggest immigrant community, focusing on linguistic and sociocultural specificities.
Selective prevention in schools
Young people at risk of dropping out of school and/or with behavioural problems are increasingly being addressed by selective drug prevention, for instance in Italy, where some 15 % of prevention interventions in schools are aimed at vulnerable subgroups of students (selective and indicated prevention).
The main subgroups at which selective prevention in schools is aimed are students with social behavioural problems, school problems or family problems, immigrant students and those belonging to ethnic minorities.
In fact, academic performance and school attendance are good predictors for drug problems, and monitoring these enables early and accurate intervention.
recommends that health promotion and prevention policy should be implemented by school authorities and that the police force should not be involved in prevention programmes.
Also, in the United Kingdom, a policy paper (ACPO Drugs Committee, 2002) recommended that the police service act only within its areas of expertise (security, offences, order) and not get involved in specific drug education.
Following this line of action, Portugal continues to run a proximity policing programme, Escola Segura (safe school).
During the 2004/05 school year a total of 320 police officers were specifically allocated to the school setting, with the aim of implementing proximity policing and offence dissuasion, both during the day and at night.
In France, experts trained by the law enforcement services to liaise with youth or grown-up populations visit schools or other services on request.
However, despite recommendations that drug education should not be delivered by police officers in uniform, as it could in some cases be counterproductive, activities carried out by police services within schools are still common in several Member States.
Selective prevention
With the recognition and development of the selective prevention approach by most Member States, vulnerable groups are increasingly being targeted.
School dropout is the focus of drug prevention programmes in several Member States. The HUP project in Storstrom County, Denmark, aims to increase the average rate of school completion from 75 % towards the national target of 95 % by focusing on vulnerable students.
Similar projects are reported in Ireland, Portugal (47 projects), Romania (one project) and Norway (brochures for teachers).
Reducing early school leaving is an official aim of Ireland’s national strategy, with the target of a 10 % reduction compared with 2005/06 rates in LDTF (local drug task force) areas.
Students most at risk are targeted by selective prevention programmes in Malta, while in France and Slovakia counselling services are provided in schools on the basis of (self-)referral.
Family-based prevention
With growing numbers of younger children initiating drug use, the improvement and intensification of family-based prevention are of increasing importance.
In pre-teenagers, family influence prevails over peer influence.
The role of the family in establishing norms and support for children is more relevant to prevention than imparting information on substances.
Several countries (e.g. Poland and Slovakia) have begun to put emphasis on vulnerable groups.
In Sweden, the most obvious increase in activities compared with previous years has been in programmes for pre-school children at risk and school children with externalising behaviours.
The number of municipalities implementing these programmes has approximately doubled.
In addition, Norway is developing a national strategy for early intervention against problem drug and alcohol use in which prevention efforts will specifically target risk groups.
Approaches not based on abstinence are effective in reducing not only consumption but also initiation among those groups in which incipient drug use is already occurring.
Thus, Poland has a nationwide programme to change the drugrelated behaviour of vulnerable children or children who are in the early stages of drug use.
The specific objective of the Polish programme is to support the family in solving drug problems.
In this regard, it is helpful that the concept of selective prevention does not focus on drug use and does not stigmatise drug use; rather, its focus is on vulnerability in a broader sense.
Family-based prevention in the EU is becoming more targeted and more firmly needs-based.
Several Member States (Germany, Spain, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families.
Chapter 2: Responding to drug problems in Europe — an overview at risk are now being implemented.
These programmes employ several techniques to attract at-risk families (e.g. providing food, financial incentives, babysitting) mostly based on Kumpfer’s ‘strengthening families programme’ (Kumpfer et al., 1996).
semi-independent associations (Belgium, Germany, France, Hungary and Finland).
Accordingly, some Member States report on strategies to provide common quality criteria, standards and technical advisory services at the local level, supporting schools or communities in developing school policies (Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom), implementing adequate prevention programmes and assuring minimum quality criteria (Denmark, France, Lithuania, Hungary, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, Romania and Norway).
Greece and Austria are leading the way in defining specifications for the accreditation of prevention agencies or prevention professionals.
The ‘strengthening families programme’ (SFP) is being implemented in Spain (Palma de Mallorca and Barcelona), the Netherlands (two cities, evaluation study) and Sweden (two cities).
Training in Ireland and Italy is under way and it is envisaged in the latter that coverage will extend to several cities.
Norway is evaluating the similar MST programme in a randomised controlled trial.
These selective family-based programmes have similar features in all Member States where they have been implemented.
Treatment and harm reduction responses
The context for EMCDDA data collection on harm reduction and treatment responses to the drug problem is provided by two main EU instruments:
Programmes for neglected children and young people from dysfunctional families are being run in Poland and in some provinces in Austria.
These programmes are implemented in local community-based venues such as socio-therapeutic common rooms, upbringing facilities, youth clubs and prevention centres.
Some countries are focusing increasingly on the children of alcoholics (Belgium, Germany, Austria).
The remaining countries still focus solely on the children of drug users.
• the EU drug strategy 2005–12 and its first action plan 2005–08, which present a framework for national policies as well as detailed recommendations for actions in the Member States aiming at the prevention of drug use and at increasing the coverage and quality of treatment and harm reduction services;
Community-located prevention
), which gives further specific recommendations on measures that Member States should consider implementing, in order to prevent and reduce healthrelated harm associated with drug dependence and to provide for a high level of health protection.
This recommendation has been reinforced by its inclusion in the EU action plan as objective 14.
Most selective prevention programmes are operated at the level of the community.
Partly, this is because the various social services involved are usually coordinated at this level.
However, in countries where communities have the power and will to enforce local norms, the community is a natural unit for environmental strategies.
Community-based selective prevention is common in the Nordic countries and in Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom, and is increasing in countries that have made less use of this approach in the past (France, Italy, Hungary, Portugal).
By establishing community norms on the availability and methods of consumption of legal drugs, and by optimising local services, local environmental prevention strategies are a good starting point for effective drug prevention programmes.
In order to evaluate the level of implementation of the strategy, it is important to determine levels of service provision and the extent to which the services are being used.
Ultimately, however, sound estimates of the coverage — the extent to which the intended target group is reached by treatment and harm reduction measures — will be needed to evaluate the action plan objectives and for creating a basis for assessing the impact of the strategy.

Annual report 2006: the state of the drugs problem in Europe of the epidemiological situation that has been achieved by the EMCDDA-driven development and implementation of indicator-based monitoring, standardised reporting on responses is limited.
Opioid substitution treatment
Methadone maintenance treatment for heroin users was pioneered in Europe by Sweden (in 1967), the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (1968) as well as by Denmark (1970), but its use remained limited for many years.
In 1996, the legal basis for the use of medication containing buprenorphine in the treatment of heroin users was first established in an EU Member State (see the selected issue on buprenorphine in the 2005 annual report).
It is now available and used in the majority of Member States.
As buprenorphine is controlled under a less stringent schedule of UN drug conventions, countries are given greater possibilities for its prescription.
In some countries, this treatment option has led to rapid increases in the number of clients treated.
New pharmacotherapy treatment modalities beyond agonist substitution are being explored, and research attention is now turning towards developing treatment responses for cocaine and crack users, many of whom also use heroin or have used it in the past (see also Chapter 5).
It is estimated that in the EU more than half a million opioid users received substitution treatment in 2003, which represents one third of the currently estimated 1.5 million problem opioid users (EMCDDA, 2005a).
The new Member States and candidate countries account for only a small fraction of the clients in substitution treatment in the European region, which can partly be explained by lower levels of opioid use in these countries.
Although the overall provision of substitution treatment remains low in these countries, there are some indications of increases in Estonia, Lithuania and Bulgaria.
The information provided shows that in some countries there have been further increases in methadone treatment provision, but that in eight countries the numbers of people
After the late 1980s, the rate at which methadone maintenance was introduced as a treatment modality accelerated.
By 2001, 24 EU countries as well as Bulgaria, Romania and Norway had introduced it (Figure 1). However, scale and coverage differ considerably between countries (see Chapter 6).

32 receiving such treatment stabilised or decreased (
Over the last decade, but even more so in the last five years, many European countries have ‘opened the doors’ to treatment by expanding their provision of substitution treatment and reducing access limitations.
Many but not all require assistance beyond the treatment of their dependency, and many seem to need lowthreshold care as well as substantial support for their reintegration.
of these countries — Denmark, Spain, Malta and the Netherlands — have a profile of long-standing heroin use and highly accessible methadone substitution programmes.
The other four countries, Latvia, Hungary, Poland and Romania, are characterised by low geographical coverage of methadone substitution, and in some places there is a waiting list for treatment.
Harm reduction responses
It is difficult to determine if decreasing numbers of clients receiving methadone treatment means that such clients are switching to buprenorphine treatment when available.
The extent to which drug dependence treatment is delivered by GPs is often not known at national level.
Provision and type of drug dependence treatment
At the same time as reaching clients and maintaining contact became an objective in itself, outreach and lowthreshold service provision gained recognition and support and have now become essential parts of a comprehensive response in many Member States.
Common response profiles are visible in Europe with regard to the prevention of infectious diseases among drug users and the reduction of drugrelated deaths (see also Chapter 7).
A survey conducted among national focal points (NFPs) in 2005 assessed the general characteristics of treatment provision in Europe.
National experts were asked whether the majority of opioid users were treated in drug-free or medically assisted programmes or whether both modalities were equally prevalent.
The reduction of drugrelated deaths was defined for the first time as a European drug policy objective six years ago, and it is an objective of the current EU action plan (33).
The number of countries which include a direct reference to the target of reducing drugrelated deaths in their national policies has continued to increase in recent years, with eight countries adopting such strategies during 2004 and 2005 (bringing the total number to 15).
Besides national policies, complementary approaches at city level are common: several capital cities (including Athens, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon and Tallinn) but also wider semi-urban regions (e.g. the eastern region of Ireland, around Dublin) have their own strategies for reducing drugrelated deaths.
In the Czech Republic, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, local or regional policies are reported to exist, and in Bulgaria strategies have been drawn up at local level in nine cities.
The results show a ratio largely in favour of medically assisted treatment, with the main substance used being methadone (except in the Czech Republic and France; for more details see Chapter 6).
The results further show that drugrelated treatment in most countries is predominantly provided in outpatient settings — only Latvia and Turkey provide most treatment in inpatient settings.
Traditional psychotherapeutic treatment modalities (psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioural, systemic/family therapy or Gestalt therapy) are the most frequently used modalities in outpatient treatment in Ireland, Latvia, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Turkey.
Nine countries report the provision of predominantly ‘supportive’ methods (which can include counselling, socio-educative and environmental therapy, motivational interviewing or relaxation techniques and acupuncture), and 10 countries combine the different methods in their outpatient work.
This emphasises the continued importance that European governments and the Commission place on the healthrelated
Concerning inpatient care, the 12-step Minnesota model is frequently used in residential care in Ireland, Lithuania, Hungary and Turkey, while six countries predominantly apply psychotherapeutic treatment modalities, five countries ‘supportive’ methods and 10 countries a combination of such approaches.
) See Table NSP-7 in the 2006 statistical bulletin.) Objective 17 of the EU action plan 2005–08 calls for the reduction of drugrelated deaths to be included as a specific target at all levels, with interventions specifically designed for this purpose.
Actions and interventions concerning drug users in prisons in the new Member States
The present data are based on a joint EMCDDA–WHO/Europe data collection project that was conducted in 2005 (1
not appear to exist, and few countries report the availability of opioid substitution treatment for acute detoxification in prison (Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovenia).
Drugrelated prerelease interventions mainly take the form of counselling and information provision (Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia).
Substitution treatment as a prerelease intervention is available in all prisons in Slovenia and in less than 50 % of prisons in Poland.
Drug testing in prisons is reported in the majority of new Member States.
However, countries vary in terms of their drug testing schemes.
Inmates are tested upon admission only in the Czech Republic, Malta and Slovenia.
Malta and Slovenia are also the only countries to test prisoners before they go on leave.
Random drug testing is carried out in all prisons in the Czech Republic, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia and in less than 50 % of prisons in Hungary.
Few prisons in the new Member States report harm reduction measures for injecting drug users.
Needle and syringe exchange programmes are not implemented in prisons in any of the new Member States, and only Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia report the provision of disinfectants for cleaning syringes.
Nevertheless, drugrelated infectious diseases are being tackled in prisons.
Vaccinations against hepatitis B are available in all prisons in six new Member States (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia), and fi ve countries report the availability of antiviral treatment for hepatitis C-positive prisoners in all prisons (Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia).
Antiretroviral treatment for HIV-positive prisoners is reported by all new Member States (2).

diseases among drug users and have included concrete objectives or tasks in their national drug strategy documents or have adopted a separate policy text that specifies how infectious disease prevention among drug users shall be tackled (Spain, Latvia, Luxembourg, Sweden), or have done both (Estonia, France, the United Kingdom).
Malta and Austria are planning to draw up specific policies for their approach in this area.
According to the reports by NFPs (35), objectives and target groups in national strategies also show a high level of synergy at the European level. Besides drug injectors, target groups include sex workers and prisoners.
In the new central European Member States in particular, but also in Norway, young people and non-injectors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent infectious disease.
Danish and Estonian policies widen the target groups even more and include groups in close contact with drug users.
In many EU countries, strategies aimed at reducing infectious disease are clearly geared towards HIV/AIDS, particularly Estonia, Spain, Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania.
However, in 10 countries (37 %), infectious disease strategies explicitly mention the prevention of hepatitis C infection among drug
These infectious disease prevention strategies are in most cases quite recent, and the timing of their adoption coincides in a number of countries with the previous EU drug strategy (2000–04), in which a reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases among drug users became a European target for the first time.
) This analysis is largely based on national reporting with a structured questionnaire (SQ 23), updated with information provided by national focal points in their national reports.

Targeted treatment and quality management public discussion in Austria was boosted by an international conference on the topic held in Vienna in 2005.
The current EU action plan also calls for high-quality treatment and harm reduction services.
The use of quality management tools at the level of the treatment and harm reduction planning has resulted in services being more target group specific, e.g. respecting the different needs of gender groups (see also the selected issue on gender).
Harm reduction strategies form an important part of the European response to drug use today, and improving access to services for the prevention and reduction of healthrelated harm is a main priority of the EU drug strategy 2005–12.
The common strategic platform on the reduction of healthrelated harm that the EU drug strategy provides is mirrored in many national policies across the EU and has supported a mainstreaming of evidence-based responses in this area.
In 2004, an improvement in the monitoring of syringe availability at European level was documented.
However, information on the provision, utilisation and coverage of the wide range of further important services delivered by lowthreshold agencies is barely recorded at national level in most countries.
A European picture cannot easily be drawn.
A project to improve the data situation is described in the box ‘Low-threshold agencies as an important data source’.
Lowthreshold agencies as an important data source
Treatment units or programmes that exclusively service one specified target group are a common phenomenon across the EU.
Children and young people under the age of 18 are treated in specialised agencies in 23 countries; the treatment of drug users with psychiatric co-morbidity takes place in specialised agencies in 18 countries; and womenspecific services are reported to exist in all countries except Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Turkey.
Services designed to meet the needs of immigrant drug users or of groups with specific language requirements or religious or cultural backgrounds are less common but have been reported from Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
For populations of drug users that are ‘hidden’ or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system, these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for delivering medical and social services.
Units that specialise in treating cannabis or cocaine users have been reported from 13 countries, and specific treatment programmes for these groups in drugs agencies exist in eight countries.
However, the availability and accessibility of such services are rated to be low in most of these countries.
A similar specialised programme for amphetamine users is reported from Spain, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.
An initiative in this direction is the joint EMCDDA–Correlation project, supported by experts from the national focal points of France, Ireland, Hungary and Norway.
The Correlation network (European Network for Social Inclusion and Health, www.correlation-net.org) represents governmental and non-governmental organisations from 27 European countries and is funded under the public health programme of the European Commission (Health and Consumer Protection DG).
Annual report 2006: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
The 2005–08 action plan calls on Member States to ‘improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes’.
Although social measures are still a less well-established response to problem drug use than treatment, interventions combining treatment, health and social actions are recognised by professionals as the best response to achieve drug user rehabilitation.
Data on social reintegration (37) are scarce in Europe, mostly compared with other treatment options, some studies have suggested that heroin prescribing may have potential benefits for clients where methadone maintenance treatment has failed.
For example, a recent German randomised controlled trial of heroin-assisted treatment (Naber and Haasen, 2006) reported positive outcomes in terms of both health and reductions in use of illicit drugs.
Nonetheless, no clear consensus currently exists across Europe on the cost and benefits of this approach and it remains an area where there is considerable political and scientific debate.

Hence, most of the information related below is based on a qualitative assessment focusing on policy, implementations and quality assurance within the Member

Assertive outreach work and an attractive range of lowthreshold services have shown promise in some local contexts (see ‘Harm reduction approaches’ in Chapter 5) and might be valuable and effective models to be used more broadly to re-establish communication with marginalised groups and eventually channel them into treatment.
The development of ‘safer’ substitution products (i.e. substances less likely to be diverted into the black market) makes it likely that drug dependency treatment will move even further towards the GP’s surgery.
This is also a process of normalisation, which allows drug dependency to be treated like a chronic disease such as diabetes.
The main provider of funds is to be found at state/national level in 11 countries, whereas funding is predominantly at regional/local level in eight countries.
Some countries report that the large groups of heroin users in substitution treatment create a corresponding demand for social reintegration support, especially for paid work.
Under the current economic circumstances, many countries may find it difficult to meet the vocational reintegration needs of older heroin users, even if they are stabilised in drug maintenance treatment.
In the EU Member States, problem drug users can access social measures through facilities either exclusively dedicated to drug users or targeting socially deprived groups.
The service most commonly offered to homeless problem drug users is access to ‘generic housing services’ (in 21 countries), while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries combine the two systems.
However, there are doubts about the effective access of homeless problem drug users to these facilities.
Low availability, local resistance to providing drug users with new facilities, restricted criteria for access and difficulties for homeless problem drug users in sticking to the rules are among the problems reported.
Getting homeless problem drug users into stable accommodation is the first step towards stabilisation and rehabilitation. Based on the estimated numbers of problem drug users and the proportion of homeless people among
All the available literature and facts and figures from Member States converge towards the same truth: the life situations of drug users are far more problematic and precarious than those of the general population.
Thus, in the last two EU drug action plans, social reintegration has been one of the ultimate aims in order to improve the health and social status of drug users.
) Social reintegration is defined as ‘any social intervention with the aim of integrating former or current problem drug users into the community’. The three
‘pillars’ of social reintegration are housing, education and employment (including vocational training).
Other measures, such as counselling and leisure activities, may also be used.
Chapter 2: Responding to drug problems in Europe — an overview clients in treatment, there are approximately 75 600 to 123 300 homeless problem drug users in Europe.
As facilities are currently available in most countries, and as some countries continue to implement new structures, the effect of these measures will depend on ensuring that homeless problem drug users can access these services.
A gender perspective on drug use and responding to drug problems, in EMCDDA 2006 annual report: selected issues addressed are: What differences exist between the use of drugs by men and women and is the gender gap narrowing?
How have Member States developed gender-specific approaches to drug prevention, treatment, social rehabilitation and harm reduction?
Are gender-specific responses equally important for males and females?
Generally among drug users, males far outnumber females.
In the EU Member States, not only is the use of illicit drugs more common in males, but men are much more likely to develop problems, seek treatment and die from drug use.
This selected issue looks at drug use and related problems from a gender perspective.
Among the important questions
Chapter 3Cannabis
Production and trafficking
Cannabis continues to be the most widely produced and trafficked plant-based illicit drug worldwide (CND, 2006).
Other countries also mentioned in 2004 as source countries for the cannabis resin seized in the EU include Albania, Portugal, Senegal, Afghanistan, Pakistan and countries in central Asia (Reitox national reports, 2005; WCO, 2005; INCB, 2006a).
Largescale production of cannabis resin is concentrated in a few countries, in particular Morocco, but also Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Total global production of cannabis resin is estimated to be 7 400 tonnes annually (CND, 2006).
Most cannabis resin consumed in the EU originates in Morocco; it is smuggled mainly via the Iberian peninsula, although the Netherlands seems to represent a secondary distribution centre for further transport to EU countries.
In 2004, the total area under cultivation amounted to 120 500 hectares
Global potential herbal cannabis production was estimated at over 40 000 tonnes in 2003 (CND, 2005), with source countries throughout the world.
Herbal cannabis seized in the EU in 2004 is reported to have originated from a variety of countries, mainly the Netherlands and Albania, but also Angola, South Africa, Jamaica and Thailand (Reitox national reports, 2005; WCO, 2005; INCB, 2006).
In addition, local (indoor or outdoor) cultivation and production of cannabis products takes place in most of the EU Member States.
Interpreting seizures and other market data
Worldwide, a total of 1 471 tonnes of cannabis resin and 6 189 tonnes of herbal cannabis was seized in 2004.
Western and central Europe (74 %) and south-west Asia and the Near and Middle East (19 %) continued to account for most cannabis resin seized, while quantities of herbal cannabis seized remained concentrated in North America (54 %) and Africa (31 %) (UNODC, 2006).
Drug seizures in a country are usually considered an indirect indicator of the supply and availability of drugs, although they also reflect law enforcement resources, priorities and strategies, as well as the vulnerability of traffickers to national and international supply reduction activities, and reporting practices.
Quantities seized may fluctuate widely from one year to the next, for example if in one year a few of the seizures are very large.
For this reason, the number of seizures is sometimes a better indicator of trends.
In all countries, the number of seizures includes a major proportion of small seizures at the retail (street) level.
Where known, origin and destination of drugs seized may indicate trafficking routes and producing areas.
The price and purity/potency of drugs at retail level are reported by most of the Member States.
However, data come from a range of different sources, which are not always comparable, making accurate comparisons between countries difficult. cult.

Chapter 3: Cannabis
Estimating drug use in the population
Last year use is clearly lower than lifetime experience.
It is estimated that about 22.5 million European adults have used cannabis in the last year, about 7 % of those aged 15–64.
National figures range between 1 % and 11 %, with the lowest figures reported by Greece, Malta and Bulgaria, and the highest by Spain (11.3 %), France (9.8 %) and the United
Cannabis use in the general or school population is assessed through surveys, which provide estimates of the proportion of people that declare having used drugs over defined periods of time: lifetime, last year or last month.
Estimates of last month prevalence will more closely represent regular use of the drug.
It is estimated that 12 million European adults have used the drug in the last 30 days, about 4 % of adults.
Country figures range between 0.5 % and 7.5 %, a 15-fold difference.
The lowest figures were reported from Lithuania, Malta, Sweden and Bulgaria, and the highest from the Czech Republic (4.8 %), Spain (7.6 %) and the United Kingdom (5.6 %) (57).
Details of the EMQ are included in a handbook for surveys about drug use among the general population (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/?nnodeid=1380). However, there are still differences between countries in methodology and year of data collection, and small differences between countries should be interpreted with caution (1).
‘Last year use’ and ‘last month use’ reflect the current situation more accurately, with the latter weighted more heavily towards people who use the drug frequently.
Use of illegal drugs, including cannabis, is concentrated mainly among young people.
In 2004, between 3 % and 44 % of Europeans aged 15–34 reported having tried cannabis, 3–20 % had used it in the last year, and 1.5–13 % had used it in the last month, with the highest figures again coming from the Czech Republic, Spain and the United Kingdom.
The European averages for this age group are 32 % for lifetime use, 14 % for last year use (compared with 2 % for 35- to 64-year-olds) and over 7 % for last month use (compared with 1 % for 35- to 64-year-olds) (58).
The European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs (ESPAD) is an important source of information on drug and alcohol use among European school students and is invaluable for recording trends over time.
ESPAD surveys were conducted in 1995, 1999 and 2003.
The next survey will take place in 2007.
Cannabis use is even higher among 15- to 24-year-olds, with lifetime prevalence ranging between 3 % and 44 % (most countries report figures in the range 20–40 %), last year use ranging from 4 % to 28 % (in most countries 10–25 %) (Figure 2) and last month use ranging from 1 % to 15 % (in most countries 5–12 %), with higher rates among males than females.
In the new Member States levels of cannabis use among young adults aged 15–24 are typically in the same range as those in the EU-15 Member States, but among older age groups rates of use drop substantially (59).
Participation in ESPAD has grown with each survey, with 26 European countries participating in 1995, 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003, including 22 EU Member States and four candidate countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Turkey).
The survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illicit drugs, with the standard time frames, and frequency of use.
Information on ESPAD and the availability of reports can be found on the ESPAD website (www.espad.org).
For more information about methodology of population surveys and the methodology used in each national survey, see the 2006 statistical bulletin.
By contrast, in the 2004 US national survey on drug use and health (60), 40.2 % of adults (defined as aged 12 years and older) reported lifetime use, compared with the EU average of about 20 %.
Note that the age range for ‘all adults’ in the US survey (12 years and over) is wider than the age standard range for European surveys (15–64).

and several European countries reported figures similar to those found in the United States.
Prevalence estimates for 15- to 16-year-old students should not be generalised to older students because large increases in prevalence may occur with small increases in age. Among 17- and 18-year-olds lifetime prevalence estimates reach over

Patterns of cannabis use
Five EU Member States (Belgium, Spain, Italy, Cyprus and the United Kingdom) reported new data from national school surveys, and Bulgaria reported data from school surveys conducted in two major cities.
Overall, the picture of cannabis use among school students in Europe remains unchanged.
The highest lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among 15- and 16-year-old school students is in the Czech Republic and Spain (44 % and 41 % respectively).
Countries where the rate is higher than 25 % include Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Slovakia (27–28 %) and Belgium, France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, where lifetime prevalence ranges from 32 % to 40 %.
The lowest lifetime prevalence estimates (less than 10 %) occur in Greece, Cyprus, Sweden, Romania, Turkey and Norway (61).
See Table EYE 3 and Figure EYE 1 (part i) in the 2006 statistical bulletin.
Chapter 3: Cannabis continuation and from 10 % to 25 % for last 30 days
Although cannabis use is largely concentrated among young people, there is some suggestion from data from Spain and the United Kingdom that people may be continuing to use the drug into their 30s or 40s.
This could represent an important long-term change in cannabis use patterns that merits further attention.
at European level. A crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report (EMCDDA, 2004a) suggests that 1 % of European adults, about 3 million people, could be daily or almost daily cannabis users.
Several countries reported increases in regular or intensive cannabis use, but only Spain reported similar data on daily use, with an increase between 1997–99 (0.7–0.8 % of adults) and 2001 (1.5 %), followed by stabilisation in 2003 (1.5 %).
The French 2003 ESCAPAD study found that 14 % of 17- to 18-year-olds (9 % of girls and 18 % of boys) could be considered to be at risk of problem use, according to a specific scale (CAST).
Other countries are also working on scales to assess intensive forms of cannabis use (Germany, Netherlands, Poland and Portugal), and the EMCDDA is promoting collaboration in this area.
Trends in cannabis use among adults
Use of cannabis, like that of other illegal drugs, is notably higher among males than among females.
The difference is more marked in the case of last year or last month use than it is for lifetime use, but the differences are smaller among young people than among older adults (see the selected issue on gender).
Cannabis use is also more common in urban areas or areas with a high population density.
It has been hypothesised that use may be spreading to smaller towns or rural areas, and Poland documented this trend in its 2005 national report.
65 forms of cannabis use (
Tracking long-term trends in drug use in Europe is made difficult by the absence of reliable time-series data.
However, an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the early 1990s onwards, and some of these are now beginning to provide valuable insights into trends over time.
It is generally considered that cannabis use started to spread in some European countries in the 1960s and became popular in the 1970s and 1980s.
Recent national surveys show significant lifetime experience among 45- to 54-year-olds in Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom, suggesting significant cannabis initiation during the late 1960s and 1970s.
An analysis of initiation to cannabis use found a marked expansion of use in Spain during the 1970s, in Germany (West) during the 1980s and in Greece during the 1990s (66).
Swedish data document a relatively high level of experimentation in the 1970s among conscripts (15–20 %).
The fact that intensive cannabis use often co-occurs with non-drug-specifi c mental problems has practical implications.
When forming a treatment plan for cannabis users it may be difficult for clinicians to know whether to start with the drug use or the mental health problem.
Studies of the effects of treatment for problem cannabis use are still scarce, and the few that exist cover only specific psychosocial treatments.
All other treatment modalities have either not been studied at all or insufficiently studied; thus evidence for efficacy and effectiveness is lacking.
National or local household, conscript and school surveys have shown that cannabis use increased markedly during the 1990s in almost all EU countries, particularly among young people.
This increase has continued until recently in almost all countries, although there are signs of stabilisation or even decreases in some cases.
) See Figure GPS-24 in the 2006 statistical bulletin.) There is as yet no universally accepted definition of ‘intensive cannabis use’; rather the definition varies across different studies.
It is, however, a broad term meaning use of cannabis that exceeds a certain threshold of frequency.
It does not necessarily imply the existence of ‘dependence/abuse’ or other problems, but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences, including dependence.
In this chapter, figures refer to ‘daily or almost daily use’ (defined as use on 20 or more days out of the last 30 days).
This benchmark has often been used in studies and can be derived from the European model questionnaire.
Risk of dependency among less frequent users is lower.
), while in Spain and France rates have recently (2002 or 2003) reached those found in the United Kingdom (Figure 3). Similar high prevalence levels are also reported for the Czech Republic.
Estimates of last month prevalence also generally increased in the past decade, although pronounced increases occurred only in Belgium and Spain.
The United Kingdom has recently reported a decrease in last month use, having previously presented the highest levels in Europe since the early 1990s.
In addition, Slovakia reported a decrease between 2002 and 2004.
In the Czech Republic and France it was not possible to assess the trend.
Levels of use are lower in Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Italy, the Netherlands and Slovakia, but all these countries have reported increases in last year use among young adults, as has Hungary, although to a lesser extent.
It should be noted that the Danish (2000) and Dutch (2001) data are now relatively old and the current situation is therefore less clear.
In Finland and Sweden prevalence rates are relatively low but also appear to be increasing; however, the difference observed in Sweden between 2000 (1.3 %) and 2004 (5.3 %) is difficult
68 to interpret because of methodological changes (
Figure 3: Trends in last year prevalence of cannabis use among young adults (aged 15–34)
In addition, school surveys can give valuable information about trends in drug use among the younger members of the population, which may predict future trends among young adults.
In most countries, since 1995, there has been an overall increase in the number of school students who have ever tried cannabis.
However, geographical variations in trends are marked.
Trends in lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among school students aged 15–16 years can be categorised into three geographical groups.
In Ireland and the United Kingdom, which have long histories of cannabis use, lifetime prevalence is high but has remained stable during the last decade (around 37–39 %).
In the eastern and central European Member States, together with Denmark, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal, lifetime prevalence of cannabis use in 2003 was substantially higher than it was in 1995.
In the third group of Member States (Finland and Sweden in the north and Greece, Cyprus and Malta in the south) plus Norway, estimates of lifetime prevalence among school students have remained at relatively low levels (around 10 % and below) (69).
Among the total of approximately 380 000 treatment demands reported in 2004 (data from 19 countries available), cannabis was the primary reason for referral to treatment in about 15 % of all cases, making it the next most
See Table GPS-4 in the 2006 statistical bulletin for further information.Sources: Reitox national reports (2005), taken from population surveys, reports or scientific articles.
new clients in Denmark, Germany, Hungary and Finland (
) See Figure TDI-2 in the 2006 statistical bulletin.)
Over the period 1999–2004, the proportion of all new clients seeking treatment for cannabis increased in most countries that reported data (73
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in adolescents seeking treatment for cannabis use who have coexisting mental health problems, and that this may be an important factor influencing demand for treatment (78
74 in a few countries the proportions are roughly equal (
The greatest demand for treatment for cannabis use is in
75 outpatient settings (
It is also important to understand better the needs of cannabis users at the population level.
The EMCDDA estimates there are around 3 million intensive cannabis users (defined as daily or almost daily cannabis use) in the EU.
Although the number of these requiring interventions is unknown, the number of cannabis-related treatment demands is small in relation to this figure.
A number of factors are likely to be associated with the increased demand for cannabis treatment, and this remains an area requiring research scrutiny.
Possible reasons for an increase include an escalation in intensive cannabis use and related problems in the population, an increased perception of the risks of cannabis use, an increase in the number of referrals to treatment from the criminal justice system, clearly important in some countries, and changes in the reporting system and/or its coverage (76).
The available data suggest that cannabis clients in outpatient treatment centres tend to be relatively young: virtually all cannabis clients new to treatment are under 30 years old.
Teenagers in specialised drug treatment are more likely to be recorded as having a primary cannabis problem than are clients in other age groups, with cannabis accounting for 75 % of treatment demands among those younger than
Most clients report having first used cannabis when in the youngest age groups, with 36.8 % using the drug for the first time before the age of 15.
Almost no one seeking treatment reports having used cannabis for the first time after the age of
Overall, cannabis clients can be divided into three groups: those who use it occasionally (34 %), those using it once to several times a week (32 %) and those using it daily (34 %).
There are marked differences between countries in the frequency of cannabis use among new clients, with the highest proportion of daily cannabis users being reported in the Netherlands and Denmark and the highest proportions of occasional users or those who have not used cannabis in the month prior to treatment being found in Germany, Greece and Hungary.
This variation probably reflects differences in referral to treatment (e.g. more referrals from the criminal justice system or from social networks) (77).
The extent to which cannabis users in treatment meet diagnostic criteria for either dependence or harmful drug use is an important question.
Currently, this is an area requiring further investigation.
As referral practices differ between countries, there is a need for studies to document the differing clinical characteristics of those receiving treatment for cannabis use.
Well-implemented universal prevention programmes can delay or reduce the initiation of young people into the use of substances such as tobacco, alcohol and cannabis.
The importance of this is underlined by evidence that early-onset users (pre- to mid-adolescence) have a significantly higher risk of developing drug problems, including dependence (Von Sydow et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2005).
An additional consideration in striving to prevent or delay the onset of initiation into cannabis use is the fact that adolescents are more vulnerable to cannabis toxicity.
Some clients seek treatment for cannabis use in combination with other drug or alcohol problems, and sometimes the request for treatment is related to more general problems, such as conduct disorder among young people. Furthermore,
The profiles of young cannabis users, at least in the early stages of consumption, do not differ from those of young alcohol or tobacco users.
This supports the idea that universal

Annual report 2006: the state of the drugs problem in Europe prevention for young people should not focus on cannabis alone, but should be aimed at preventing use of alcohol and tobacco too.
available data from the first two or three months of operation show attendance figures of 3 500–4 000 individuals per month, of whom 2 000–2 500 were cannabis users (the others being parents, relatives and youth workers).
Alternative strategies are to offer short but structured courses with around 10 group sessions (Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria).
An accompanying manual, SKOLL (self-control training), has been launched by a Dutch–German Euregio project.
Often, cannabis-specific ‘training courses’ rely on the fact that cannabis use or possession is illegal and participants are referred via the criminal justice system.
Motivation to participate largely comes from the fact that attendance at such courses is an obligatory part of a judicial sentence.
Nonetheless, these methods enable contact to be established with at least part of the group at risk.
Gender is an important issue in cannabis prevention (see the selected issue on gender).
Boys are at more risk of progression to more intensive use, perhaps because girls are more responsive to parental disapproval and are more cautious in the selection of their peers.
However, this is changing as the traditional roles of males and females change in modern societies.
In several European countries projects aimed at preventing cannabis as well as alcohol use (Bagmaendene, Denmark; Beer-Group, Germany; and Risflecting, Austria) attempt to address boys’ lack of communication skills.
It is known that one reason for intensive consumption of alcohol and cannabis among boys is that they find it difficult to approach girls, and thus these projects offer training in flirting.
Selective prevention in schools targets risk factors associated with drug use such as early school leaving, antisocial behaviour, academic underachievement, low bonding, and infrequent attendance at school and impaired learning because of drug use.
The German project Stoned at School aims to train teachers in early detection and early intervention, prevention of cannabis consumption, and establishing contact between schools and drug counselling facilities.
Like similar projects in Austria, it is a 10-module training scheme to increase teachers’ awareness of cannabis consumption and identify pupils at risk.
Many European selective prevention interventions tend towards the provision of information on cannabis.
Several more evidence-based approaches, including normative restructuring (e.g. learning that most peers disapprove of use), assertiveness training, motivation and goal-setting, as well as myth correction (on value associations with cannabis), have yet to become established as standard elements of cannabis prevention programmes.
A recent meta-analysis of prevention programmes for vulnerable young people (Roe and Becker, 2005) found that information-based approaches have little or no impact on consumption behaviours or attitudes, whether in universal prevention or selective prevention.
The same authors found that comprehensive social influence programmes have an important effect on vulnerable young people.
Specific drug counselling centres are frequent in Germany, France and the Netherlands.
Since January 2005, more than 250 ‘cannabis consultation’ clinics have been set up throughout the French territories.
Aimed at teenagers who are experiencing difficulties as a result of their use of cannabis or other drugs, as well as their parents, these facilities are anonymous, free and open to all.
They are located in the major French cities for easy access.
Consultations are carried out by professionals trained in the use of evaluation tools and brief interventions that deal with addictions, and are also able to identify social, medical or psychiatric services appropriate for clients needing specialised care.
This new type of structure is to be subjected a follow-up study.
An important point emerging from the few available evaluations of European selective cannabis prevention projects (FRED, Way-Out, Sports for Immigrants and others; see above and EDDRA at http://eddra.emcdda.europa.eu) is the efficacy of comprehensive social influence techniques.
Among the positive effects achieved by these techniques are a reduction in consumption levels, an increase in the self-perception of problem use, a reduction in the main risk factors and associated problems, as well as increased selfcontrol and motivation.
Brief intervention for cannabis users
Brief interventions are cost-effective and may be particularly appropriate to cannabis users, as they are found to work well with drug users who:
• are experiencing few problems with their drug use;
• have low levels of dependence;
• have a short history of drug use;
Brief intervention is an approach that aims to make people reflect on their use of drugs and to provide them with skills to control it.
The concept is largely based on motivational interviewing, a non-judgemental, non-confrontational approach that explores the client’s values, objectives, self-assessment of use and gives feedback on discrepancies between the client’s self-image and actual status.
• are unsure or ambivalent about changing their drug use.
Brief intervention is often targeted at an early stage of a person’s alcohol or drug use to prevent the development of serious drug problems later on.
There is evidence for the effectiveness of brief intervention in preventing alcohol and tobacco misuse, and there is growing interest in the value of this approach for other substances.
This kind of approach is now used in several countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and the United Kingdom, where interventions may take the form of counselling, ‘cannabis courses’ or even self-help websites.
For example, the German website-based counselling programme, Quit the Shit (www.drugcom.de), is an innovative approach, using telematics, for cannabis users who want to reduce or stop their drug use.
Similar websites with self-help components include www.jellinek.nl/zelfhulp/cannabis/frameset.html by Jellinek (the Netherlands) and www.knowcannabis.org.uk/ by HIT (United Kingdom).
Brief intervention has been found to be very useful in selective prevention measures targeted at cannabis users who would not normally come into contact with treatment settings.
In the case of intensive cannabis users, education-based programmes that emphasise abstinence may not be effective.
Chapter 4Amphetamines, ecstasy and other psychotropic drugs
Supply and availability (81)
The production of amphetamines and ecstasy is difficult to quantify because ‘it starts with readily available chemicals, in easily concealed laboratories’ (UNODC, 2003a).
The most recent estimate of annual global production of amphetamines and ecstasy is about 520 tonnes (UNODC, 2003b).
Global seizures of these substances peaked in 2000 at 46 tonnes.
Following a decline in 2001 and 2002, seizures increased again to 34 tonnes in 2003, and declined slightly to 29 tonnes in 2004.
In 2004, the share of global amphetamines and ecstasy seizures accounted for by methamphetamine fell to 38 % (from 66 % in 2003), with ecstasy accounting for 29 % and amphetamine 20 % (CND, 2006).
Amphetamine and methamphetamine are central nervous system stimulants.
Of the two drugs, amphetamine is by far the more commonly available in Europe.
Worldwide, increasing levels of use of methamphetamine are a cause for considerable concern, as the drug is associated with a range of severe health problems.
Within Europe, significant methamphetamine use appears to be restricted to the Czech Republic.
Ecstasy refers to synthetic substances that are chemically related to amphetamines but which differ to some extent in their effects.
The best-known member of the ecstasy group of drugs is 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), but other analogues are also occasionally found in ecstasy tablets (MDA, MDEA, etc.).
These drugs are sometimes known as entactogens, a reference to their very specific mood-altering effects.
Sometimes they provoke effects more typically associated with hallucinogenic substances.
Worldwide, amphetamine production remains concentrated in western and central Europe, in particular in Belgium, the Netherlands and Poland.
In this subregion, Estonia, Lithuania and Bulgaria also play a significant role in the illicit manufacture of amphetamine, and to a lesser extent Germany, Spain and Norway, as shown by the dismantling of amphetamine laboratories in 2004 in these countries (UNODC, 2006) (82).
Outside Europe, amphetamine is mainly manufactured in North America and Oceania (CND, 2006).
Trafficking in amphetamine in 2004 remained mainly intraregional.
Most amphetamine found on European illicit markets comes from Belgium, the Netherlands and Poland, and also from Estonia and Lithuania (in the Nordic countries) (Reitox national reports, 2005; WCO, 2005).
Historically, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has been by far the best-known hallucinogenic drug, but overall consumption levels have been low and somewhat stable for a considerable time.
Recently, evidence of increased availability and use of naturally occurring hallucinogenic substances, hallucinogenic mushrooms in particular, has emerged.
Of the six tonnes of amphetamine seized worldwide in 2004, about 97 % was seized in Europe, mostly in western/central Europe and south-eastern Europe (accounting respectively for 67 % and 26 % of the global amount seized) (CND, 2006).
In 2004, an estimated 33 000 seizures of amphetamine, amounting to 5.2 tonnes and 9.6 million units, were made in the EU.
To detect new drugs emerging on the European drug scene, the EU has in place an early-warning system.
This system also monitors potentially harmful new trends in the use of psychoactive substances.

83 been the main amphetamine-seizing country in the EU (
Turkey reported the interception of 9.5 million units of amphetamine in 2004.
Despite some fluctuations, at EU level both the overall number of amphetamine seizures (84) and quantities seized (85) have increased since 1999 and, based on the findings from reporting countries, this upward trend seems to have continued in 2004.
In 2004, the average retail price of amphetamine ranged from EUR 4 per gram in Slovenia to EUR 64 per gram in
Germany, Spain, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Turkey and Norway (88
In 2004, the price (

Ecstasy on average amphetamine purity for the period 1999–2004 reveal overall downward trends in Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Finland and Norway and upward trends in Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Hungary and Austria.
Worldwide, in terms of quantities manufactured and trafficked, methamphetamine continues to be more important than amphetamine or ecstasy, although its share in global seizures fell in 2004.
It continues to be mostly manufactured in East and South-East Asia (China, the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand), followed by North and Central America (United States, Canada, Mexico).
In Europe, production of methamphetamine is largely limited to the Czech Republic,
Globally, Europe remains the main centre of ecstasy production, although its relative importance appears to be declining as ecstasy manufacture has spread in recent years to other parts of the world, notably to North America (United States, Canada) and East and South-East Asia (China, Indonesia, Hong Kong) (CND, 2006; UNODC, 2006).
Although the Netherlands remained in 2004 the main source of ecstasy for Europe and the world as a whole, ecstasy laboratories were also uncovered in Belgium, Estonia, Spain and Norway (Reitox national reports, 2005; UNODC, 2006).
The ecstasy seized in the EU is reported to originate from the Netherlands and Belgium, and to a lesser extent Poland and the United Kingdom (Reitox national reports, 2005).
) This situation should be checked against 2004 data for the United Kingdom when available.
Data on both number of amphetamine seizures and quantities of amphetamine seized in 2004 were not available for Ireland and the United Kingdom; data on quantities of amphetamine seized were not available for Slovenia in 2004; data on number of amphetamine seizures were not available for the Netherlands in 2004.

) Data for 2004 provided by Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands do not allow methamphetamine and amphetamine seizures to be distinguished, while Ireland and the United Kingdom did not provide 2004 data on drug seizures, making it difficult to know whether any methamphetamine seizures occurred in these five countries in 2004.
See Table PPP-8 in the 2006 statistical bulletin.
Chapter 4: Amphetamines, ecstasy and other psychotropic drugs
Ecstasy trafficking is still strongly concentrated in western Europe, although, like production, it has spread throughout the world in recent years.
Of the 8.5 tonnes (weight equivalent) of ecstasy seized globally in 2004, 50 % was recovered in western and central Europe, 23 % in North America and 16 % in Oceania (CND, 2006).
total number of tablets analysed in 2004.
An exception to this finding occurred in Bulgaria, where a high percentage (61 %) of tablets analysed contained amphetamine and/or methamphetamine as the only psychoactive substances.
The MDMA content of ecstasy tablets varies greatly between batches (even between those with the same logo) both between and within countries.
In 2004, the average content of active substance (MDMA) per ecstasy tablet was reported to range from 30 to 82 mg (100) (Reitox national reports, 2005).
After a rapid increase over the period 1999–2001, the

) at EU level declined in
2002–03; but data from reporting countries indicate an

In 2004, the average retail cost of ecstasy tablets ranged from less than EUR 3 each in Lithuania and Poland to

During 1999–2004, average retail prices of ecstasy, corrected for inflation (98),
99 decreased. However, in both 2003 and 2004, the available data suggest that numbers of LSD seizures and amounts intercepted increased for the first time in nine years, with relatively large amounts of the drug seized in Germany, France, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Poland in 2004.
In 2004, the average cost to users of an LSD unit ranged from EUR 2.50 in Portugal to EUR 11.60 in Malta (104).
Average prices of LSD, corrected for inflation (105), showed an

Data on both number of ecstasy seizures and quantities of ecstasy seized in 2004 were not available for Ireland and the United Kingdom; data on number of ecstasy seizures were not available for the Netherlands in 2004.
Data on quantities seized in 2004 provided by the Netherlands were only estimates, which could not be included in the analysis of trends to 2004.

International action against production and trafficking of amphetamines and ecstasy there was a large seizure in Greece of ephedrine from Pakistan.
The activities of Project Prism in Europe have focused on preventing the smuggling of 3,4-MDP-2-P and P-2-P into the EU for use in the illicit manufacture of MDMA and amphetamine respectively.
In 2004, seizures of 3,4-MDP-2-P and P-2-P were the largest ever reported globally, Europe accounting for the greatest quantities of 3,4-MDP-2-P seized and the United States for the greatest quantities of P-2-P seized.
In 2004, seizures in Europe totalled 10 161 litres of 3,4-MDP-2-P (mostly in the Netherlands and Belgium) and 9 297 litres of P-2-P (mostly in Poland and the Netherlands) (111).
In the area of synthetic drugs, Europol has been running Project Synergy since December 2004 (107).
It is supported by 20 EU Member States and some third countries, and includes an analytical work file (AWF) with operational sub-projects carried out throughout the EU across several countries, as well as a number of instruments used for analytical and strategic purposes, such as the Europol ecstasy logo system (EELS) (including the ecstasy logo catalogue) and the Europol illicit laboratory comparison system (ELICS).
Europol continues to support the CHAIN project (108) on amphetamine profiling and the European Joint Unit on Precursors (EJUP).
Besides on-the-spot expert assistance in dismantling illicit synthetic drug production, recent sub-projects have focused on comparing the laboratories dismantled, on uncovering chemical dump sites as starting points for investigations, on back-tracking tablet machines, and on investigating trafficking in precursor chemicals to the EU countries.
Seizures of safrole are reported from all regions worldwide but quantities remain small, except in China, which reports seizures over 100 kg.
In Europe 122 litres of safrole was seized in 2004, mainly in Latvia but also in Lithuania.
Prevalence and patterns of use
Ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine are key precursors for methamphetamine, while 1-phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P) is also used to manufacture amphetamine; 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone (3,4-MDP-2-P), safrole and safrole-rich oils are used in the illicit manufacture of
Traditionally, population surveys have shown that, next to cannabis, amphetamines and ecstasy are the illegal substances most commonly used, albeit the overall prevalence of their use is lower than that of cannabis.
Use of ecstasy became popular during the 1990s, whereas amphetamines have been used for much longer.
Among EU Member States, use of amphetamines (
) and ecstasy appears to be relatively high in only a few countries, namely the Czech Republic, Estonia and the United Kingdom.
Recent surveys among the adult population (15–64 years) report that lifetime prevalence of amphetamine use in Europe ranges from 0.1 % to 5.9 %, except in the United Kingdom (England and Wales), where it reaches 11.2 %.
Licit trade of ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine amounted to a total of 526 and 1 207 tonnes respectively in 2004.
The largest seizures of these chemicals were reported in North America and South-East Asia, but there is concern that seizures have spread to all regions.
Smuggling of ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine to Europe originates mainly in western Asia.
In 2004, 2.6 tonnes of ephedrine and 1 kg of pseudo-ephedrine were seized in Europe (110); the seizures were mostly small seizures and came from many different laboratories, a majority in the Czech Republic, although
Seizure data do not include quantities involved in stopped shipments.) Within the framework of population surveys, data on ‘amphetamine use’ include use of both ‘amphetamine’ and ‘methamphetamine’ under one category.

Among young adults (15–34 years) experience of amphetamine use is reported by 0.1–9.6 %, with the United Kingdom (England and Wales) reporting a lifetime prevalence rate of 16.5 % (which may reflect a historical phenomenon, see below).
Half of the countries providing data have prevalence rates below 4 %, with the highest rates after the United Kingdom reported by Denmark (9.6 %), Norway (5.9 %) and Germany (5.4 %).
An average of 4.8 % of young Europeans have tried amphetamine.
Denmark (3.1 %) and Estonia (2.9 %) report the highest last year prevalence rates (115).

Until recently, LSD was the most commonly used hallucinogenic substance.
This may now be changing as

Reports about acute or chronic health problems requiring medical interventions relating to the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms are rare. However, some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hallucinogenic substances by young people.
Six countries have tightened up their legislation on mushrooms in the last five years (Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom).
The changes made by these countries extend prohibition to include hallucinogenic mushrooms, although legal controls do not always apply to exactly the same mushrooms or states of preparation.
In 2004, seizures of hallucinogenic mushrooms were reported in the Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Lithuania, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,
increasingly reported.
The availability of hallucinogenic mushrooms appears to have increased since the late 1990s, when they began to be marketed alongside other ‘natural’ products in ‘smart shops’ in the Netherlands and elsewhere (127).
For example, in the United Kingdom, during the early 2000s, the number of shops selling hallucinogenic mushrooms increased, and by 2005 it was estimated that they were being sold in about 300 shops and market stalls across the country.
The sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms through the Internet also emerged, with sites, mainly based in the Netherlands, selling fresh mushrooms, growing kits and spore prints.
Online marketing of hallucinogenic mushrooms is conducted in a variety of languages, mainly English, French and German, implying a wide international consumer base.
Recent adult and school population surveys in the EU indicate that, among young people aged 15–24 years, lifetime use of hallucinogenic mushrooms ranges from less than 1 % to 8 % (128).
Lifetime prevalence estimates for the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms among school students aged 15–16 years are equal to, or higher than, lifetime prevalence estimates for ecstasy use in nine of the EU Member States (Hibell et al., 2004).
However, there are indications that continuation rates are lower for hallucinogenic mushrooms than for most other drugs.
This is a common feature of hallucinogenic drug use and reflects the fact that young people generally choose to confine this type of drug use the misuse of these drugs for recreational purposes (130).
In March 2001 the UN drug control system added GHB to the list of internationally controlled drugs, and as a result all EU Member States have been updating their legislation on this substance.
More recently, in March 2006, the INCB recommended that the WHO expedite its review to determine whether ketamine should be placed under international control (INCB, 2006a). At national level, ketamine is controlled under drug legislation, as opposed to medicine regulations, in almost half of the EU Member States.
Species of fungi containing other psychoactive substances are more rarely used.

The shortage of prevalence data on GHB and ketamine suggests that use of these substances has stabilised at low levels in most countries.
The newly notified substances belonged to three major chemical groups — phenethylamines, tryptamines and piperazines.
Various substances from these groups have been previously notified through, and are currently being monitored by, the early-warning system (EWS) (132).

However, the absence of accurate and comparable systems for recording deaths and non-fatal emergencies related to the use of these substances limits the data available in this area.
Two countries have reported deaths related to GHB, usually in association with other drugs.
The municipal health service in Amsterdam recorded an increase in the annual number of non-fatal emergencies attributable to the use of GHB from 25 in 2000 to 98 in 2004, more than the number of medical emergencies attributed to use of ecstasy, amphetamine, LSD or hallucinogenic mushrooms.
In Sweden, detections of GHB (or its precursors GBL and 1,4-BD) in body fluid specimens increased from 24 in 1997 to 367 in 2004.
Deaths associated with GHB have also been reported in Sweden: between 1996 and 2004 the drug was detected in 36 drugrelated deaths, with nine of these occurring in 2004.
In England and Wales in 2003, GHB was mentioned in the coroner’s report of three deaths, in one of which GHB was the only drug mentioned (ONS, 2006).
However, toxicological information from one hospital in the United Kingdom, covering a large region, indicates that GHB was detected in five deaths between May and December 2005 (131).
the rapid exchange of information on new psychoactive substances that may pose public health and social threat, thus allowing the EU institutions and Member States to act on both new narcotic and new psychotropic drugs that appear on the European drug scene.
The EMCDDA and Europol, in close cooperation with their networks — the Reitox national focal points (NFPs) and Europol national units (ENUs) respectively — have been assigned a central role in detecting and notifying new psychoactive substances.
The decision also provides for an assessment of the risks associated with these new substances so that measures applicable in the Member States for the control of narcotic and psychotropic substances (2) can also be applied to new psychoactive substances if appropriate.
The decision broadens the scope of, and replaces, the 1997 joint action (3), which was devoted exclusively to new synthetic drugs.

As GHB is water/alcohol-soluble, and because of its potentially incapacitating effects, often followed by amnesia, there have been concerns that it is being used in drug-facilitated sexual assaults (so-called ‘date rapes’).
However, as cases may remain unreported, and because forensic evidence is scarce and such crimes are difficult to prove, there is no sound evidence on the extent of this phenomenon.
Further research is therefore needed to determine the nature and extent of this potentially worrying development.

substance 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP). mCPP is an aryl-substituted piperazine, as is benzylpiperazine (BZP), a substance monitored by the EWS since 1999.
The first official notifications of the detection of mCPP were received by the EMCDDA and Europol in February/March 2005, concerning samples collected in France and Sweden.
By the end of 2005, mCPP-containing tablets had been seized by the law enforcement authorities or found in the context of various recreational activities (open-air dance/music festivals, dance clubs, etc.) in almost all Member States.
They are almost always designed to look like, and presumably marketed as, ecstasy.
The drug is chiefly available in tablet form, and the subjective effects of mCPP and MDMA are partially comparable (Bossong et al., 2005).
In addition, mCPP is often found in combination with MDMA.
Since this is unlikely to be the result of accidental contamination, it suggests that the deliberate addition of
In a joint report, the EMCDDA and Europol recommended, in line with the provisions of the Council decision, that no formal risk assessment be carried out as there is evidence that mCPP is used in the manufacture of at least one medicinal product.
However, it was also noted that, despite the fact that at present there is little evidence of significant public health or social risks related to mCPP, this question must remain open in the absence of a thorough scientific risk assessment.
Developments in drug use within recreational settings, in EMCDDA 2006 annual report: selected issues
New developments in the promotion of recreational drugs via the Internet and in recreational drug use itself bring with them new challenges in the fields of policy, prevention and risk reduction.
These are explored in this selected issue, which also reviews in detail the innovative drug prevention and risk reduction initiatives that have been introduced in the EU over the past decade in response to the complex problem of the interaction of leisure activities and drug use by young people.
Drug use and the recreational activities of young people are often linked.
In particular, studies targeted at young people attending music and dance events consistently report much higher prevalence estimates for drug use than those found in general population surveys, with particularly high levels of stimulant drug use often being reported.
Can differences between countries be explained in terms of the variety of commercial nightlife settings available, music culture, drug availability and disposable incomes?

(Amsterdam) may have played a part in the development of alternative routes, increasingly, for example, via Africa, but also via eastern and central Europe and secondary distribution from there to western Europe (Reitox national reports, 2005; WCO, 2005; INCB, 2006a).
Cocaine is the most trafficked drug in the world after herbal cannabis and cannabis resin.
In terms of volume seized — 578 tonnes worldwide in 2004 — trafficking continued to be predominantly in South America (44 %) and North America (34 %), followed by western and central Europe (15 %) (CND, 2006).
In 2004, an estimated 60 000 seizures of 74 tonnes of cocaine were made in the EU.
Most seizures of cocaine are reported in western European countries, especially Spain, which accounts for about half the seizures and amounts

Over the period 1999–2004, the number of cocaine seizures (136) increased overall at EU level, while quantities (137) seized fluctuated within an upward trend.

Global production of cocaine in 2004 is estimated to have increased to 687 tonnes, of which Colombia contributed 56 %, Peru 28 % and Bolivia 16 % (UNODC, 2005).
Most of the cocaine seized in Europe comes directly from South America (mainly Colombia) or via Central America and the Caribbean. In 2004, Suriname, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador, Curaçao, Jamaica, Mexico, Guyana and Panama were reported as transit countries for cocaine imported into the EU (Reitox national reports, 2005; WCO, 2005; CND, 2006; INCB, 2006a; Europol, 2006).
Some also passed through Africa, increasingly through western Africa and countries in the Gulf of Guinea (mainly Nigeria), but also eastern Africa (Kenya) and north-western Africa through the islands off the coast of Mauritania and Senegal (CND, 2006; INCB, 2006a).
The main points of entry in the EU remain Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal, as well as Belgium, France and the United Kingdom (Reitox national reports, 2005; CND, 2006; Europol, 2006).
Although Spain and the Netherlands still play an important role as distribution points for the reporting countries (

is not associated with Asia, there is growing concern that traffickers may be targeting the region for diverting potassium permanganate from licit trade.
There is also concern that traffickers may be diverting potassium permanganate to the Andean subregion through the Caribbean islands.
Thus, while acknowledging some success in identifying suspicious transactions and in stopping shipments, the INCB (2006b) has urged governments to develop operating procedures to backtrack information from cocaine laboratory seizures in order to trace the chemicals back to the source, identify transit countries and investigate trade companies, so that traffickers may experience more difficulties in relocating their activities.

Prevalence and patterns of cocaine use
Based on recent national population surveys, it is estimated
14 5 that about 10 million Europeans (
) have tried cocaine at least once (lifetime prevalence), representing over 3 % of all adults (146).
National figures on reported use range between 0.5 % and 6 %, with Italy (4.6 %), Spain (5.9 %) and the United Kingdom (6.1 %) at the upper end of this range.
It is estimated that about 3.5 million adults have used cocaine in the last year, representing 1 % of all adults.
National figures in most countries range between 0.3 % and 1 %, although prevalence levels are higher in Spain (2.7 %) and the United Kingdom (2 %).
) from licit trade for use in the illicit manufacture of cocaine, in particular in the Americas.
The licit trade in potassium permanganate is large: since 1999, 30 exporting countries/territories have provided 4 380 preexport notifications to the INCB involving over 136 560 tonnes of potassium permanganate.
Since 1999, 233 shipments involving over 14 316 tonnes of the substance have been stopped or seized because of concerns over the legitimacy of the orders or the end-users, and diversions were identified.
In 2004, 1.4 tonnes of potassium permanganate was seized in Europe, mainly in the Russian Federation, followed by Romania and Ukraine (144) (INCB, 2006b).
Traffickers appear to have found ways to avoid controls and monitoring mechanisms introduced under Operation Purple.
Indeed, although the illicit manufacture of cocaine
As with other illegal drugs, cocaine use is concentrated among young adults.
Lifetime experience is highest among young adults aged 15–34 years, although last year use is slightly higher among 15- to 24-year-olds.
Cocaine seems to be predominantly a drug used by those in their 20s, but, compared with cannabis use, cocaine use is less concentrated among younger people.
Lifetime experience among 15- to 34-year-olds ranges from 1 % to 10 %, with the highest levels again found in Spain (8.9 %) and the United Kingdom (10.5 %).
Last year use ranges between 0.2 % and 4.8 %, with the figures for Denmark, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands being around 2 %, and for Spain and the United Kingdom over 4 % (Figure 6).
Data from school surveys show very low lifetime prevalence for the use of cocaine, ranging from 0 % in Cyprus, Finland and Sweden to 6 % in Spain, with even lower lifetime prevalence rates for use of crack cocaine, ranging from 0 % to 3 % (Hibell et al., 2004).

Last year use was lower, but four countries reported figures higher than 3 %, with Spain and the United Kingdom reporting figures of about 6–7 % (147), suggesting that in these countries about 1 in 15 young males has used cocaine recently. This proportion will be substantially higher in urban areas.
Among the general population, cocaine use seems to be occasional, occurring mainly at weekends and in recreational settings (bars and discos), where it can reach high levels.
Research studies conducted among young people in dance and music settings in different countries reveals prevalence estimates for cocaine use that are much higher than those found in general populations, with lifetime prevalence ranging from 10 % to 75 % (see the selected issue on drug use in recreational settings).
For instance, the British Crime Survey 2004/05 reported a prevalence estimate for the use of ‘class A’ drugs among people going to discos or nightclubs that was at least two times higher than the rate among those who did not go to these venues (ChiviteMatthews et al., 2005) (see also the selected issue on drug use in recreational settings).
On average, about one third of all European adults who have ever used cocaine have used it in the previous 12 months; for comparison, only 13 % report having used it in the previous 30 days.
For instance, 2–4 % of males aged 15–24 years in Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Bulgaria (148) report having used cocaine in

data from diverse sources (e.g. market indicators, treatment demands, deaths).
Although the available information on cocaine trends among the population is improving as more countries carry out repeated surveys, the data are still limited.
In the case of cocaine, added difficulties are the lower prevalence levels and the probable under-reporting of use.
Recent cocaine use (last year) increased markedly in the second half of the 1990s among young adults in the United Kingdom, until 2000, and in Spain, until 2001, with an apparent stabilisation in recent years.
In Germany, a moderate increase was observed over the 1990s, but the figures have remained stable in recent years, at levels clearly lower than in Spain and the United Kingdom (Figure 7).
Among users in addiction treatment settings or in socially marginalised groups, injection was frequent, and crack use was usual in Hamburg, London and Paris, and to a lesser extent in Barcelona and Dublin. Crack use among the European general population seems to be low.

In addition, survey information should be complemented by focused studies among young people in selected groups (nightlife settings).
Treatment demand data (150
However, crack cocaine users may pose particular challenges for treatment services as they tend to have a more marginalised social profile than users of cocaine powder.
A European study on cocaine use (powder and crack cocaine) found an association between crack use and social and mental health problems; however, the study also reported that crack cocaine use itself is not sufficient to explain the social or mental health problems (Haasen et al., 2005).
A recent study of 585 cocaine and crack clients in Scotland found that the crack users are more likely to have a longer history of problematic drug use and more involvement in criminal activities (Neale and Robertson, 2004, cited in the United Kingdom national report).
Looking at the profile of cocaine clients in outpatient settings, it appears that new clients using cocaine as their primary drug are usually older than other drug consumers: 70 % are in the 20–34 years age group with a smaller group (13 %)
After opioids and cannabis, cocaine is the drug most commonly reported as the reason for entering treatment and accounts for about 8 % of all treatment demands across the EU in 2004 (151).
It should be noted that Spain, a country usually reporting high treatment demands for cocaine, has not yet provided data.
This overall figure reflects a wide variation between countries: in most countries treatment demands related to cocaine use are quite low, but in the Netherlands (37 %) and, historically, Spain (26 % in 2002) the proportion of all clients who ask for treatment for cocaine use is far higher.
In the most recent data available, a group of countries report percentages of cocaine clients among all treatment clients between 5 % and 10 % (Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, the United Kingdom and Turkey), whereas in the remaining countries
) and overall around 12 % of all new treatment demands are reported as cocaine related. Cocaine is also reported as a

Cocaine is often used in combination with another illicit or licit subsidiary drug, often cannabis (31.6 %), opioids (28.6 %) or alcohol (17.4 %) (157).
Local studies of drug injectors suggest that, in some areas, the combination of heroin and cocaine within an injection may be becoming more popular (sometimes referred to by drug injectors as ‘speedballing’).
The combination of opioids and cocaine is currently more apparent in the treatment data.
Among clients reporting primary use of opioids, 31 % in Italy, 42 % in the Netherlands and 44 % in the United Kingdom report a secondary cocaine use. Among primary cocaine users, 28 % in Italy and 38 % in the United Kingdom report secondary use of opioids.
The increasing trends among clients seeking treatment for cocaine use reported in previous years is continuing; from 1999 to 2004, an analysis that interpolates for unreported data suggests that the proportion of new clients demanding treatment for cocaine use grew from around 10 % to 20 % during this period (based on 17 EU countries and Bulgaria
Overall, most cocaine treatment demands in Europe are not related to crack cocaine: around 80 % of new outpatient cocaine clients are reported to be using cocaine hydrochloride (cocaine powder), with less than 20 % using

Combining several specific psychosocial treatment interventions is currently considered the most promising treatment option for cocaine and other psychostimulant users.
The combination of the community reinforcement approach (CRA) with contingency management has been shown to reduce cocaine use in the short term (Higgins et al., 2003; Roozen et al., 2004).
Immunotherapy for cocaine addicts
CRA is an intensive treatment method that involves family, friends and other members of the client’s social network throughout the treatment and consists in training the clients to make social contacts, to improve their self-image, and to find work and rewarding leisure activities in order to establish a different lifestyle (Roozen et al., 2004).
In combination with contingency management — a method that aims to influence clients’ behaviour by offering meaningful incentives, e.g. presents, vouchers or privileges for cocaine-free urine samples — positive effects on drug use and psychosocial functioning have been achieved during the treatment phase and post-treatment follow-up in cocaine-dependent outpatients,although effects on cocaine use appeared to be limited to thetreatment period (Higgins et al., 2003).
In contrast to heroin addiction, which can be treated with agonists such as methadone or antagonists such as naltrexone, there are currently no medical treatments available for cocaine addiction.
The reason for this would appear to be the mechanism of action through which cocaine exerts its effects on the brain neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin.
Whereas heroin binds to brain opioid receptors, such as the mu receptors, and therefore mimics the action of the brain’s own endorphins, cocaine inhibits the reabsorption of dopamine (and indeed serotonin) from the neuronal synapse once it has had its effect, leading to a build-up of the transmitter, thus prolonging and strengthening its effect.
New approaches to the highly problematic groups of cocaine- and crack-using heroin users focus on harm reduction as primary treatment goal and apply behavioural therapies, in particular contingency management approaches, in combination with methadone maintenance programmes or heroin-assisted treatment (Schottenfeld et al., 2005; van den Brink, 2005; Poling et al., 2006).
This does not necessarily mean that it is not possible to develop a medical treatment for cocaine addiction, only that it may be more difficult to do so and may involve different concepts from those used in the development of treatments for heroin dependence.
Harm reduction approaches
One exciting strand of research is the use of immunotherapy, i.e. the development of a vaccine that would effectively ‘neutralise’ the action of cocaine by preventing the drug from reaching the brain.
The basic concept has undergone limited testing.
A vaccine developed in the United Kingdom was tested in a small number of cocaine addicts, 18 in total, over a period of 14 weeks.
It was found that three quarters of the vaccinated cohort of cocaine addicts were able to remain drug free for a period of three months with no untoward sideeffects.
In addition, after six months, both those who relapsed and those who did not stated that the feelings of euphoria were not as potent as prior to vaccination.
As a result of these findings, the vaccine, known as drug–protein conjugate TA-CD, is undergoing phase 2 clinical trials.
An alternative immunotherapeutic approach involves the development of monoclonal antibodies to cocaine, but this has only been tested preclinically.
The potential benefit of the cocaine vaccine TA-CD has raised ethical concerns about the use of a vaccine: who would receive it, who would make the decision and on what criteria, etc.
In Europe, the development of harm reduction approaches that target cocaine use has been limited.
This might now be beginning to change as increased awareness of both the extent of cocaine use and the problems associated with it stimulates interest in developing responses to address the needs of cocaine users.
The value of prevention and harm reduction approaches to reducing the risks associated with cocaine use remains largely unexplored, but a number of areas may have potential for the development of this kind of approach.
As cocaine use can escalate quickly, brief interventions that can alert users to the fact that they may be beginning to experience negative consequences due to their use of the drug may also be worth exploring.
Annual report 2006: the state of the drugs problem in Europe and some lowthreshold programmes specifically target crack-using sex workers to transmit safer sex and drug use messages and to distribute condoms and lubricants (see selected issue on gender).
As a result of the serious health and social problems associated with crack cocaine use, there is more experience of developing services for this group, although activities are limited to those relatively few cities in Europe that have experienced a significant crack cocaine problem.
In a number of cities crack cocaine users have been targeted by outreach schemes that attempt to engage with what is often viewed as a difficult group to work with.
Although overall the evidence base remains relatively weak, some studies have suggested that benefits can accrue.
For example, one study of an innovative outreach treatment programme in Rotterdam (Henskens, 2004, cited in the Dutch national report) identified factors that were observed to be important for treating this group of clients, who are often difficult to engage in conventional drug services.
A more controversial approach has been adopted in some cities in Europe, where the concept of safe consumption rooms, usually targeting drug injection, has been extended to drug inhalation.
Rooms for supervised inhalation have been opened in several Dutch, German and Swiss cities (EMCDDA, 2004c).
Although the supervision of consumption hygiene is a main objective of such services, there is some evidence that they could also act as a conduit to other care options; for example, monitoring of one service in Frankfurt, Germany, reported that, during a six-month evaluation period in 2004, more than 1 400 consumptions were supervised, while 332 contact talks, 40 counselling sessions and 99 referrals to other drugs services were documented.
Chapter 6Opioid use and drug injection
Heroin supply and availability (159
In Europe, two forms of imported heroin are found: the commonly available brown heroin (its chemical base form) and the less common and usually more expensive white heroin (a salt form), which typically originates from South-East Asia.
In addition, some opioid drugs are produced within the EU, but manufacture is mainly confined to small-scale production of home-made poppy products (e.g. poppy straw, poppy concentrate from crushed poppy stalks or heads) in a number of eastern EU countries, for example Lithuania, where the market for poppy stalks and concentrate seems to have stabilised, and Poland, where production of ‘Polish heroin’ might be decreasing (CND, 2006).
Production and trafficking centre to other western European countries.
Heroin seizures in 2004 suggest that the southern branch has now gained the same importance as the northern branch in terms of volume smuggled (WCO, 2005; INCB, 2006a).
Since the mid1990s, heroin has been increasingly (but to a lesser extent than through the Balkan routes) smuggled to Europe through the ‘silk route’ via central Asia (in particular Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan), the Caspian Sea and the Russian Federation, Belarus or Ukraine, to Estonia, Latvia, some of the Nordic countries and Germany (Reitox national reports, 2005; CND, 2006; INCB, 2006a).
Although these routes are the most important, countries in the Arabian peninsula (Oman, United Arab Emirates) have become transit sites for heroin consignments from South and South-West Asia destined for Europe (INCB, 2006a).
In addition, heroin destined for Europe (and North America) was seized in 2004 in East and West Africa, the Caribbean, and Central and South America (CND, 2006).
Heroin consumed in Europe is predominantly manufactured in Afghanistan, which remains the world leader in illicit opium supply and in 2005 accounted for 89 % of global illicit opium production, followed by Myanmar (7 %).
Global production of illicit opium remained relatively stable between 1999 and 2004, except in 2001, when a ban on opium poppy cultivation enforced by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan resulted in a dramatic but short-lived decline; it is estimated that about 4 670 tonnes was produced in 2005, a 4 % decline compared with 2004 (CND, 2006).
Global potential production of heroin was estimated at 472 tonnes in 2005 (495 in 2004) (UNODC, 2006).
In 2004, 210 tonnes of opium (or 21 tonnes of heroin equivalent), 39.3 tonnes of morphine and 59.2 tonnes of heroin were seized worldwide.
Asia (50 %) and Europe (40 %) continued to account for the greatest quantities of heroin seized worldwide.
Europe’s share is increasing, largely as a result of increased seizures in south-eastern European countries (Turkey), which for the first time surpassed the volume intercepted in western and central Europe (CND, 2006).
Heroin enters Europe by two major trafficking routes.
The historically important Balkan route continues to play a crucial role in heroin smuggling.
Following transit through Pakistan, Iran and Turkey, the route then diverges into a southern branch through Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Albania, Italy, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina and a northern branch through Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, the latter operating as a secondary distribution the total amount intercepted in 2004 (

Seizures in Turkey (1 600 litres in 2004) have significantly declined in recent years, perhaps indicating that traffickers have developed new routes and methods of diversion.

International action against the manufacture and trafficking of heroin
Data in this section are derived from the EMCDDA problem drug use (PDU) indicator, which covers ‘injecting drug use or long duration/regular use of heroin, cocaine and/or amphetamines’.
Historically, problem drug use estimates have principally reflected heroin use, although in a few countries, as discussed elsewhere in the report, amphetamine users are an important component.
) is an important precursor used in the illicit manufacture of heroin.
Operation Topaz is an international initiative to monitor licit trade in acetic anhydride and to investigate methods and routes of diversion (INCB, 2006b).
There is considerable licit trade in acetic anhydride, making it difficult to control.
This is illustrated by the fact that,
In the period 1999–2004, data on heroin prices were available for at least three consecutive years: for brown heroin in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Spain,
France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Norway; for white heroin in the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Latvia and Sweden; and for heroin of type undistinguished in Lithuania and the United Kingdom.

Moreover, estimates are often localised geographically, and extrapolation to form national estimates are not necessarily reliable.
historically predominated now report changes towards other drugs.
Most heroin users are now believed to use stimulants and other drugs besides opioids, but reliable data on polydrug use are very hard to obtain at the EU level (see Chapter 8).
Despite the general trend towards diversification of the phenomenon, in many countries estimates of problem drug use are exclusively based on problem use of heroin or other opioids as the primary substance.
This can be seen in the estimated rates of problem opioid use (see Figure 8), which
It is not clear whether in the other countries the prevalence of non-opioid problem use is almost negligible or, possibly, significant but too difficult to estimate.
Estimating the number of problem opioid users is difficult, and analyses of a sophisticated nature are required to obtain prevalence figures from the available data sources.
Estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use at national level over the period 2000–04 range between one and eight cases per 1 000 population aged 15–64 (based on midpoints of estimates).
Estimated prevalence rates of problem opioid use differ greatly between countries, although when different methods have been used within one country the results are largely consistent.
Higher estimates of problem opioid use are reported by Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta and Austria (5–8 cases per 1 000 inhabitants aged 15–64 years), and lower rates are reported by the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Cyprus, Latvia and the Netherlands (fewer than four cases per 1 000 inhabitants aged 15–64 years) (Figure 8). Some of the lowest well-documented estimates now available

Chapter 6: Opioid use and drug injection
One can derive from the limited data a general EU prevalence of problem opioid use of between two and eight cases per 1 000 of the population aged 15–64.
A lack of reliable and consistent historical data complicates the assessment of trends over time in problem opioid use.
The evidence that has been collected suggests that the prevalence of problematic opioid use differs widely between countries, and that trends are not consistent across the EU.
Reports from some countries, supported by other indicator data, suggest that problem opioid use continued to increase during the latter half of the 1990s (Figure 9) but appears to have stabilised or declined somewhat in more recent years.
Repeated estimates on problem opioid use for the period between 2000 and 2004 are available from seven countries (the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Austria): four countries (the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Spain) have recorded a decrease in problem opioid use, while one reported an increase (Austria — although this is difficult to interpret as the data collection system changed during this period).
Evidence from people entering treatment for the first time suggests that the incidence of problem opioid use may in general be slowly declining; therefore in the near future a decline in prevalence is to be expected.
Local and regional estimates specifically of problem opioid use are not available; however, the available data regarding problem drug use (including use of stimulants and other drugs) suggest that there is a large variation in prevalence among cities and regions.
The highest local prevalence estimates in the period 2000–04 are reported from Ireland, Portugal, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, reaching rates of between 15 and 25 per 1 000 (171).
Geographic variability is, as might be expected, also marked at the local level; for example, the prevalence in different parts of London varies between 6 and 25 cases per 1 000.
The wide variation in local prevalence rates makes generalisation difficult.
Although the majority of drug users reduce or stop their drug use after incarceration, some detainees continue and others start using drugs (and/or injecting drugs) while in prison.

Cannabis remains the most frequently used illicit drug, with lifetime prevalence rates among prisoners ranging between 4 % and 86 %, compared with lifetime prevalence rates of 3–57 % for cocaine, 2–59 % for amphetamines and 4–60 % for heroin (2).

Monitoring the proportion of current injectors among heroin users entering treatment forms an important complement to monitoring the prevalence of injecting drug use in the general population. However, it is important to remember that the observed proportions do not necessarily reflect trends in the prevalence of all injecting drug use.
For example, in countries with a high proportion of stimulant users (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden), the rates of injecting among heroin users might not be representative of the overall situation.

Injecting drug users (IDUs) are at very high risk of experiencing adverse consequences such as serious infectious diseases or overdoses.
It is therefore important to consider drug injection separately.
Despite their importance for public health, few countries provide estimates of injecting drug use at national
The proportion of IDUs among primary heroin users entering drug treatment again suggests marked differences in levels of injecting drug use between countries as well as varying trends over time (173).
In some EU-15 Member States from which data are available (Denmark, Greece, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom), rates of injecting among heroin users in treatment have declined.
However, in most of the new Member States, at least where data exist, a large proportion of heroin users entering treatment are injectors.
or subnational level (172
Treatment demand data (174) are not categorised by primary drug, given the scarcity of data, although the trends in the proportion of IDUs among treated heroin users (see below) are of course specific for heroin injecting.
In many countries, opioids (largely heroin) remain the principal drug for which clients seek treatment.
Of the total treatment requests reported for 2004 under the treatment demand indicator, opioids were recorded as the principal drug in about 60 % of cases — and just over half (53 %) of these clients reported injecting the drug (175). It should be
Available estimates vary considerably between countries: since 2000, estimates at national level have mostly ranged between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15–64, with some higher estimates existing prior to 2000.

The proportion of clients seeking treatment for heroin use varies between countries.
Based on the most recent data available, countries can be classified into three groups according to the proportion of drug users seeking treatment who report problem use of heroin, as follows:
11–12 in Sofia, Bulgaria, but, in general, demand for treatment for heroin appears to be rare among the young.
• below 50 % — the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden;
• 50–70 % — Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Cyprus, Latvia, Portugal, United Kingdom, Romania;
Opioid clients are reported to be marginalised in society, with low levels of education, high unemployment rates and often unstable accommodation; Spain reports that 17–18 % of opioid clients are homeless.
• over 70 % — Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg,
Countries where a sizeable proportion of opioid clients are using substances other than heroin include Hungary, where the use of home-made opium poppy products is widespread, and Finland, where most opioid clients are misusing
Since the time lag between first use and first demand for treatment is generally between 5 and 10 years and the time between initiation and regular drug use is estimated to be 1.5–2.5 years (Finnish national report), it can be concluded that opioid clients typically experience 3–7 years of regular drug use before first seeking specialised treatment.
Most opioid users, like users of other drugs, seek treatment in an outpatient setting; however, in comparison with cocaine and cannabis clients, a higher proportion of opioid clients are treated in inpatient centres.
In general, levels of injecting are higher among opioid users seeking treatment in the new Member States (above 60 %) than in the EU-15 Member States (below 60 %), with the exception of Italy and Finland, where the proportion of opioid injectors among clients is 74 % and 79.3 % respectively.
Most countries with significant numbers of new heroin clients each year (except Germany, where the reporting base has been extended) report that there has been a decrease in the last 4–5 years, although not among clients who have previously been in treatment.
The number of repeat requests has generally not declined, and in most countries the total number of treatment demands for heroin has remained roughly stable.
Notable exceptions are Germany and the United Kingdom, where total reported requests have increased.
The EU drug strategy 2005–12 places a high priority on improving the availability of and access to treatment and it calls on Member States to provide a comprehensive range of effective treatments. Historically, residential treatment represented an important setting for the treatment of problem opioid users.
It has been previously reported that the population of clients requesting treatment for opioid use is an ageing one, and this trend continued in 2004.
Nearly all opioid users seeking treatment are over 20 years old, and almost half of them are over 30. Data available at European level show that only

In response to an EMCDDA questionnaire, experts in most (16) Member States indicated that substitution treatment is the principal form of treatment available.
However, in four countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia), drug-free treatment is reported to be more common, and in two countries, Spain and Sweden, a balance between medically assisted treatment and drug-free treatment options is reported.
Long-term drug substitution is not the only purpose of opioid pharmacotherapy.
Methadone and buprenorphine are also used to treat opioid withdrawal, when the therapeutic goal is to help the individual achieve abstinence by giving a reducing dose over a fixed period to help minimise the distress of withdrawal.
The opioid antagonist naltrexone, an aversive pharmacotherapy option for opioid dependence, is also sometimes used as an aid to prevent relapse, as it blocks the effects of heroin, although the evidence base for the use of this drug is still inconclusive.
Some countries (Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) also have heroin prescription programmes, although the number of patients receiving this kind of treatment is very small compared with other forms of drug substitution (probably constituting less than 1 % of the total).
This form of treatment remains controversial and is generally provided on a scientific trial basis for long-term users in whom other therapeutic options have failed.
Substitution therapy for opioid dependence (mainly treatment with methadone or buprenorphine) is in place in all EU Member States (183) as well as Bulgaria, Romania and Norway, and there is now a substantial European consensus that it is a beneficial approach to the treatment of problem opioid users, although in some countries it remains a sensitive topic (see Chapter 2).
The role of substitution treatment is becoming less controversial internationally; the UN system came to a joint position on substitution maintenance therapy in 2004 (WHO/UNODC/UNAIDS, 2004), and in June 2006 WHO included both methadone and buprenorphine in its model list of essential medicines.
A recent review of the effectiveness of drug dependence treatment in preventing HIV transmission found that behavioural interventions can enhance the positive effects of substitution treatment on HIV prevention, whereas the effectiveness of psychological therapy alone is variable.
Abstinence-based treatment showed good outcomes with regard to HIV prevention for those who remain in treatment for three months or more (Farrell et al., 2005).
Monitoring methadone provision
Methadone is a controlled drug according to Schedule I of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and levels of domestic consumption are monitored annually by the INCB.
There is now a robust evidence base for the value of substitution programmes using drugs such as methadone or buprenorphine.
Studies have shown that substitution therapy is associated with decreased use of illicit drugs, reduced rates of injecting, a reduction in behaviours associated with a high risk of spread of HIV or other infectious diseases, such as sharing of equipment, and improvements in both social functioning and general health.
Research has also suggested that levels of criminal activity may be reduced and that sufficient provision of substitution treatment may have an impact on the number of drugrelated deaths.
Optimum outcomes depend on timely entry into the programme, sufficient duration and continuity of substitution treatment, and adequate doses of medication.
Excluding the Czech Republic and France, where high-dose buprenorphine treatment (HDBT) is reported to be the most common option, more than 90 % of treatments in all other countries were with methadone.
The EU and the USA together account for 85 % of the world’s methadone consumption, and methadone consumption in these countries has shown a steady increase over the last decade.
Considering that high-dosage buprenorphine treatment was introduced in Europe only 10 years ago, the drug’s popularity as a therapeutic option has developed remarkably quickly (see Figure 1) (184).
) In Cyprus, the use of methadone in detoxification treatment is reported since 2004 and the beginning of a methadone maintenance treatment pilot project has been announced, but no cases in treatment have been reported.
In Turkey, methadone is officially registered for the treatment of opioid dependency, but no treatment cases have been reported.

As a rule, noticeable increases in consumption figures follow the introduction of this treatment option at national level.
Recently, signs of a stabilisation in levels of methadone consumption can be observed in the statistics for Denmark, Spain, Malta, the Netherlands, and possibly Germany.
This matches reported trends in the number of clients in treatment (see Chapter 2).

Chapter 7Drug-related infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
In Portugal, an apparent decline in newly diagnosed cases of HIV among IDUs recorded previously is called into question by the 2004 data, which reveal an incidence of HIV infection of
98.5 cases per million population, the highest in the EU (
In the United Kingdom, the incidence of HIV among IDUs has slowly increased but is now stable at just under 2.5 cases per million population per year.
In Ireland, the incidence increased during the late 1990s to a peak of 18.3 cases per million per year in 2000, fell to 9.8 per million in 2001, and subsequently increased to 17.8 cases per million in 2004.
One of the more serious health consequences of the use of illicit drugs, and in particular of drug injection, is the transmission of HIV and other infectious diseases, notably hepatitis C and B. The relationship between drug injecting and the transmission of infection is well established.
Reducing drug injecting and the sharing of injecting equipment has therefore become a primary goal of public health interventions in this area.
Studies also point to a relationship between drug use and high-risk sexual activity; this suggests a growing importance in linking drug use interventions with public health strategies aimed at sexual health.
In terms of monitoring at the European level, data on infectious disease are collected by regular notification sources, where drug injecting may be recorded as a risk factor, and during special studies of drug-using populations in different settings.
HIV outbreaks related to injecting drug use occurred as recently as 2001 in Estonia and Latvia, and 2002 in Lithuania.
Since then rates have strongly declined; a decline in the rates of newly reported cases is to be expected after an initial epidemic phase as an endemic level of infection becomes established (see below).
HIV seroprevalence among tested IDUs
Seroprevalence data from IDUs (percentage infected in samples of IDUs) are an important complement to HIV case reports.
Repeated seroprevalence studies and routine monitoring of data from diagnostic tests can support conclusions drawn from case reporting data and can provide more detailed information on specific regions and settings.
However, prevalence data come from a variety of sources and, in some cases, may be difficult to compare; thus, they should be interpreted with caution.
At present, most countries report low rates of newly diagnosed HIV infection attributed to injecting drug use.
Countries that have maintained consistently low rates of HIV infection among injecting drug users (IDUs) provide an opportunity to explore what factors can account for this, a question posed by the current EU drug action plan and currently a focus of an EMCDDA coordinated study.
Complacency should be avoided, however; neither Spain nor Italy, both of which have experienced HIV epidemics among IDUs, provides national HIV case reporting data, and this has a significant negative impact on the value of these data for describing the overall EU picture.
Furthermore, data emerging from some countries are raising concerns that HIV infection may be increasing, at least among some populations of IDUs.
In France, where HIV cases have been recorded only since 2003, there has been an increase in the incidence of HIV among IDUs (albeit from a low level), from an estimated 2.3 cases per million population in 2003 to 2.9 cases in
In the Baltic states, the available seroprevalence data indicate that transmission among IDUs may still not be under control (Figure 10). In Estonia, a recent study suggests that prevalence in IDUs is increasing in one region (Tallinn: from

Finally, in some countries that have never experienced largescale epidemics among IDUs, some recent prevalence data suggest that vigilance is warranted.
This would seem to be the case in Luxembourg, Austria and the United Kingdom, although the increases remain limited and are not confirmed by case reporting data.
Low HIV prevalence countries
WHO estimates that coverage of HAART among patients in need of treatment was high in western European countries (over 70 %) in 2003, but more restricted in most eastern European countries, including Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia (189).
More recent data on the coverage of HAART suggest that the situation has markedly improved, with all EU and candidate countries now achieving at least 75 % coverage.
Specific data regarding availability of HAART among IDUs are not available, however, and it remains to be seen whether improved coverage will be reflected in a reduction in the incidence of AIDS among IDUs in Estonia and Latvia.
In all four countries in western Europe most affected by AIDS, i.e. Spain, France, Italy and Portugal, the incidence has declined, since about 1996 in the case of the first three countries, but only since 1999 in Portugal.
Portugal is still the country with the highest incidence of IDU-related AIDS, with 31 cases per million population in 2004.
However, in Latvia the incidence is similar: 30 cases per million.
EuroHIV data up to 2004 (corrected for reporting delay) suggest that the incidence of IDU-related AIDS is increasing
HIV prevalence among tested IDUs continues to vary widely between countries in the EU (Figure 10).
In a number of countries HIV prevalence among IDUs has recently increased or has been high for many years.
In contrast, in several countries, HIV prevalence among IDUs remained very low during 2003–04: HIV prevalence was less than or around 1 % in the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Slovenia (based on national samples), and in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Norway (based on subnational samples).
In some of these countries (e.g. Hungary), both HIV prevalence and hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence are among the lowest in Europe, suggesting low levels of injecting (see ‘Hepatitis B and C’), although in some countries (e.g. Romania) there is evidence that the prevalence of hepatitis C is increasing.
Sex differences in HIV prevalence among tested IDUs
Available seroprevalence data for 2003–04 reveal
1 88 differences between male and female tested IDUs (
Combined data from Belgium, Estonia (2005), Spain (2002), France, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria, Poland and Portugal resulted in a total sample of 124 337 males and 20 640 females, tested mostly in drug treatment centres or other drug service provision sites.
Overall prevalence was 13.6 % among males and 21.5 % among females.
HCV antibody prevalence data among young IDUs (aged under 25) are available from 14 countries, although in some cases sample sizes are small. There is wide variation in results, with countries reporting both high and low figures from different samples.
The highest prevalence rates among young IDUs in 2003–04 (over 40 %) were found in samples from Belgium, Greece, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, and the lowest prevalence (under 20 %) in samples from Belgium, Greece, Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Slovenia, Finland, the United Kingdom
See Figure INF-1 (part i) in the 2006 statistical bulletin.)
Annual report 2006: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Preventing infectious diseases
Effective responses and Turkey.
Considering only studies of young IDUs with national coverage, the highest prevalence rates (over 60 %) are found in Portugal and the lowest (under 40 %) in Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Austria and Slovenia.
Although the sampling procedures used may result in bias towards a more chronic group, the high prevalence of HCV antibodies found in a national sample in Portugal (67 % among 108 IDUs under 25 years) is still worrying and may be indicative of continuing high-risk behaviour among young IDUs (see also ‘Recent trends in newly reported HIV cases’, p. 75).
A number of public health interventions have been shown to be useful in reducing the spread of infectious diseases among drug users and there is a growing consensus that a comprehensive approach to service provision in this area is most likely to be successful.
Historically, the debate has largely focused on the prevention of HIV infection among drug injectors, but the need for effective measures to inhibit the spread of hepatitis has increasingly become recognised, as has the need to prevent the spread of infectious diseases among non-injecting drug users.
Data on HCV antibody prevalence among new injectors (injecting for less than two years) are scarce and suffer from small sample size, but they may provide a better proxy indicator of very recent incidence rates than data on young injectors.
What information is available for 2003–04 shows that the highest prevalence rate among new injectors (over 40 %) was found in samples from Greece, Poland, the United Kingdom and Turkey and the lowest prevalence (under 20 %) in samples from Belgium, the Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus and Slovenia.
Low prevalence rates have been found in small but national samples of new injectors in Cyprus (only two of 23 injectors tested positive for HCV antibodies, a rate of 9 %), and Slovenia (two out of 32 tested positive, or 6 %).
It must be noted that evidence on effectiveness is strongest for the prevention of HIV infection among drug injectors.
A robust body of available evidence shows that interventions can be considered effective and that access to treatment of all types provides protection (Farrell et al., 2005; WHO, 2005).
Since the mid1990s, the European response has been characterised by an increasing provision of drug dependence treatment (see Chapter 2), and overall this appears to be one of the elements that have contributed to the relatively encouraging picture now seen in Europe in terms of epidemic spread of HIV among injectors.
Other elements include a range of information, education and communication techniques, voluntary infectious disease counselling and testing, vaccination and the distribution of sterile injecting equipment and other prophylactics.
The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers also varies greatly both within and between countries.
The most complete data are for anti-HBc, which indicates a history of infection.
In 2003–04, prevalence rates of over 60 % among IDU samples were reported from Italy and Poland, while samples with prevalence rates of less than 20 % were recorded in Belgium, Ireland, Cyprus, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.
In the Nordic region, the great majority of notified acute cases of hepatitis B occur among IDUs, and hepatitis B outbreaks have coincided with increases in drug injecting in several countries.
For example, the data for Norway suggest a strongly increasing incidence of hepatitis B infections among IDUs between 1992 and 1998 with a decline thereafter.
In Finland, hepatitis B notifications among IDUs have fallen steeply in recent years, possibly as a result of vaccination programmes and a comprehensive needle and syringe exchange system.

Syringe exchange or vending machines complement the available NSP services in eight countries (195), although provision appears to be restricted to a handful of sites, with only Germany and France reporting substantial activities (around 200 and 250 machines respectively).
Types of needle and syringe programmes in European countries
See Table NSP-2 in the 2006 statistical bulletin.
Syringe coverage in Europe: is it sufficient? cient?
Although nearly all Member States report some availability of needle and syringe programmes (NSPs), the impact of this kind of intervention depends on the level of provision being adequate to meet the needs of IDUs.
Formally organised pharmacy syringe exchange or distribution networks exist in nine European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and the United Kingdom), although participation in the schemes varies considerably, from nearly half of pharmacies (45 %) in Portugal to less than 1 % in Belgium.
In Northern Ireland, needle and syringe exchange is currently organised exclusively through pharmacies.
The purchase of syringes through pharmacies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some injectors, and the potential to exploit this contact point as a conduit to other services clearly exists.
Work to motivate and support pharmacists to develop the services they offer to drug users could form an important part of extending the role of pharmacies, but to date only France, Portugal and the United Kingdom appear to be making significant investments in this direction.
Mortality and drugrelated deaths
Recent estimates of the number of injecting drug users and of the number of syringes distributed through NSPs are available for nine European countries.
From these data, it is possible to make a crude estimation of the annual number of syringes available per injector (1).
Based on the most recent data available, coverage rates of NSPs vary considerably, with the number of syringes distributed per estimated IDU per year varying from 2–3 in Greece, through 60–90 in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Austria and Portugal, to approximately 110 in Finland, 210 in Malta and more than 250 in Luxembourg and Norway.
In addition, syringes are also available from pharmacies, and data from the Czech Republic and Finland allow overall syringe availability to be estimated.
Combining distribution and sales data suggests that, in a year, drug injectors obtain on average 125 syringes in the Czech Republic and 140 syringes in Finland.
Most information on mortality among problem drug users in Europe refers to opioid users.
Many factors are known to influence injecting frequency among those using drugs, including patterns of use, level of dependency and type of drug used.
A recent study exploring the relationship between HIV prevalence and the coverage of syringe distribution suggested that behavioural factors, e.g. injecting frequency and personal reuse of syringes, strongly influence the level of syringe distribution required to achieve a substantial decrease in HIV prevalence (Vickerman et al., 2006).
The measurement of syringe coverage is an important component of understanding the likely effects of syringe distribution in disease prevention and for assessing unmet needs.
However, it is important to take account of the availability of syringes through pharmacies sales (prices, density of pharmacy network) as well as drug injectors’ behavioural patterns and environmental factors in interpreting these data.
This issue is further discussed in the 2006 statistical bulletin.
See the 2006 statistical bulletin for technical notes.
A collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project examined mortality among opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations (196).
The study found a very high mortality among opioid users compared with their peers: 6–20 times higher among males and 10–50 times higher among females.
It was estimated that in six of the locations (Amsterdam, Barcelona, Dublin, London, Rome and Vienna) 10–23 % of the overall mortality among adults aged 15–49 years could be attributed to opioid use, mainly overdoses, AIDS and external causes (accidents, suicides).
mortality 9.5 times higher than in the general population, but with a decreasing trend.
A mortality cohort study carried out in the Czech Republic found that the mortality of stimulant users was 4–6 times higher (standardised mortality ratio — SMR) than that of the general population, while that of opioid users was 9–12 times higher.
A French cohort study that followed individuals arrested for heroin, cocaine or crack use found that male mortality was five times higher and female
Chapter 7: Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths users (for example, homelessness, mental illness, violence, poor nutrition) may also contribute substantially to the high mortality in this group.
In addition, AIDS related to intravenous drug use accounted for 1 528 deaths in 2002 (197), although this is probably an underestimate.
Other causes of drugrelated deaths, such as illness (e.g. hepatitis), violence and accidents, are more difficult to assess, but it is likely that they account for an important number of deaths.
It has been estimated that 10–20 % of deaths among young adults in European cities can be attributed to opioid use (see above). To this should be added mortality related to other forms of drug use, although this is very difficult to quantify.
million inhabitants, with rates of over 25 being found in Denmark, Estonia, Luxembourg, Finland, the United Kingdom and Norway. Among males aged 15–39 years, mortality rates are typically three times higher (averaging 40 deaths per million), with seven countries presenting rates over 80 deaths per million.
These figures should be considered minimum estimates, and it should also be taken into account that, despite improvements, there are still important differences in quality of reporting between countries, such that direct comparisons should be made with caution (200).
Opioids are present in most cases of ‘acute drugrelated deaths’ due to illegal substances reported in the EU, although in many cases other substances are also identified during the toxicological examination, in particular alcohol, benzodiazepines and, in some countries, cocaine.
In Europe most cases of opioid deaths are related to heroin, but other
20 1 opioids play a role (see below) (
Drugrelated death is a complex concept. In some reports it refers only to deaths caused directly by the action of psychoactive substances, while in other cases it includes also deaths in which drug use played an indirect or circumstantial role (traffic accidents, violence, infectious diseases).
A recent report that analysed the types of harm caused by illegal drug use in the United Kingdom estimated that drugrelated death was the main harm related to drug use (MacDonald et al., 2005).
Opioid overdose is one of the leading causes of death among young people in Europe, particularly among males in urban areas.
At present, overdose is also the main cause of death among opioid users in the EU as a whole, in particular in countries with a low prevalence of HIV among injectors (see ‘Mortality among problem drug users’, p. 80).
In this section, and in the EMCDDA protocol, the term ‘drugrelated deaths’ refers to those deaths caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs and, generally, occurring shortly after the consumption of the substance(s).
Other terms used to describe such deaths include ‘overdoses’, ‘poisonings’, ‘drug-induced deaths’ or ‘acute drug
Between 1990 and 2003, from 6 500 to over 9 000 deaths were reported each year by the EU countries, adding up to more than 113 000 deaths during this period.
These figures can be considered as a minimum estimate owing to probable
The majority of drug users who overdose are men (202), accounting for 65–100 % of cases, and in most countries the proportion ranges between 75 % and 90 %, with the highest proportion of females in the Czech Republic, Poland and Finland and the lowest in Greece, Italy and Cyprus.
These findings must be interpreted in the context of differential rates of opioid use and injecting between men and women.

) This is the agreed common definition by the EMCDDA group of national experts.
At present, most national case definitions are the same as the EMCDDA definition or very similar, although some countries still include cases due to psychoactive medicines or non-overdose deaths, generally as a limited proportion (see the 2006 statistical bulletin methodological note ’Drug-related deaths summary: definitions and methodological issues’.

Methadone deaths and Finland.
There are very few reported overdose deaths among people under the age of 15 years (17 cases out of a total number of deaths of 7 516, based on most recent data available for each country), although drug deaths in this age group could be under-reported.
The EMCDDA figures include a few deaths among those over 65 years, with only seven countries reporting that more than 5 % of cases fall into this age group (203).
Several countries reported the presence of methadone in a substantial proportion of drugrelated deaths in their 2005 Reitox reports.
The terminology used varies between countries, and in some cases it is difficult to determine what role methadone played in the death.
In several new Member States and candidate countries the mean age at death is comparatively low (Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania), and there is a high proportion of overdose cases younger than 25 years, which may signal a younger heroin-using population in these countries.
The high mean age in the Czech Republic is related to the inclusion of many deaths due to psychoactive medicaments (Figure 12).
In many Member States, the age of overdose victims is increasing, suggesting a decrease in initiation to heroin
Denmark reported that methadone was the cause of poisoning (alone or in combination) in 44 % of deaths (95 out of 214 in 2004), a similar proportion to 2003, but with a clear increase from 1997; Germany reported that 345 cases were attributed to ‘substitution substances’ (46 alone and 299 with other narcotics in 2004) with

Based on ‘national definitions’ as presented in methodological notes on drugrelated deaths in the 2006 statistical bulletin.
National trends in drugrelated deaths can provide some insight into developments in patterns of problematic drug use in each country such as heroin epidemics and high-risk behaviours (e.g. injection), as well as treatment provision and even differences in heroin availability.

a clear decrease since 2002; and the United Kingdom reported 216 cases with ‘mention’ of methadone (England and Wales, in 2003), also with a clear decrease from 2002.
Spain reported that there were few overdose cases involving methadone in isolation (2 %), but that it was frequently present in combination in opioid deaths (42 %) and cocaine deaths (20 %).
Other countries did not report methadone deaths or the numbers reported were very small.
It is unclear what factors lie behind these differences, and whether there is under-reporting of cases in some countries (205).
Data available from the EU reveal some general trends in drugrelated deaths.
Among the EU-15 Member States, a sharp increase was apparent during the 1980s and early 1990s, possibly paralleling the expansion of heroin use and injecting.
Drug deaths continued to increase between 1990 and 2000, although less sharply (Figure 13).
The total annual number of drugrelated deaths in those Member States providing information (most Member States, old and new) increased by 14 %, from 8 054 in 1995 to 9 392 in 2000.
Buprenorphine and fentanyl deaths
Deaths due to buprenorphine poisoning appear to be rare, a fact that is attributed to the agonist–antagonist pharmacological characteristics of this drug.
Since 2000, many EU countries have reported decreases in the numbers of drugrelated deaths, possibly related to increases in treatment availability and harm reduction initiatives, although declines in the prevalence of drug use may also be important.

Deaths related to ecstasy and amphetamines due to a number of factors, including differential efficacy of interventions or differences in risk factors between the
Deaths related to ecstasy started to be reported in Europe during the 1990s as the drug became popular.
Ecstasy deaths cause considerable concern as they often occur unexpectedly among socially integrated young people.
Information on ecstasy deaths is limited, but data from 2005 Reitox national reports suggest that deaths involving ecstasy remain relatively unusual compared with opioid deaths, although in some countries the number is not negligible.
In Europe as a whole, there were references to 77 deaths,
210 which should be considered as a minimum estimate (
Cases were reported from Denmark (2), Germany (20), France (4), Hungary (3), and the United Kingdom (48 cases with ‘mentions’ — 33 in England and Wales), where probably reporting is better than in other countries.
In Spain, ecstasy was present in 2.5 % of drug poisonings.
In countries with a longer series of data, different patterns of drugrelated deaths can be detected.
In some countries drugrelated deaths peaked during the early 1990s and subsequently decreased, for instance in Germany, where drugrelated deaths peaked in 1991–92, Spain (1991), France (1994) and Italy (1991).
In other countries, for instance Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Finland, Sweden and Norway, drug deaths peaked later, between 1998 and 2001, and again subsequently declined.
In other countries, the pattern was less clear or numbers were stable.
Although interpretations should be made with caution, because of the relatively low numbers of drugrelated deaths in some countries, these patterns could be related to the trends in heroin injection (209).

Chapter 7: Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
The issue of the risk of ecstasy use has often been raised.
From the limited data available, it is difficult to identify trends with certainty, but an increasing trend seems to exist in all countries with larger number of cases, i.e. Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, although in the Netherlands increases have halted in the last two years.
of 5–8 cases and 2–5 cases per 100 000 users in the two countries for which this calculation can be made.
In addition, cocaine may be a contributor to deaths due to cardiovascular problems (arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, cerebral haemorrhages), particularly in users with predisposing conditions or risk factors (tobacco, hypertension, angiomas) or with increasing age.
Many of these cases may go unnoticed at present because of a lack of awareness.
Further research is needed in this area.
Amphetamine deaths are also infrequently reported, although in the Czech Republic 16 deaths were attributed to pervitin (methamphetamine) in 2004, almost double the 2003 figure, correlating with an increase in the estimated number of problem pervitin users and treatment demands.
For GHB deaths see Chapter 4.
Cocaine use is frequent among opioid users, and it is common to find cocaine in toxicological analyses of opioid overdoses, as well as other substances such as alcohol and benzodiazepines Cocaine is commonly consumed together with alcohol, a combination that may result in increased toxicity.
Research into the circumstances of overdoses has supported the development of interventions that target high-risk situations or high-risk individuals.
Such measures may achieve an important reduction in the deaths attributable to the immediate effects of drug taking.
The data that do exist indicate that many deaths involving cocaine also involve opioids.
A number of factors may be responsible for recent modest reversals in the trend in overdose deaths observed in some Member States. These include decreases in prevalence and injecting rates, increased prevention efforts, increased availability and uptake of, and retention in, treatment and possibly reductions in risk-taking behaviour.
Profile of responses
In most countries, expert opinion on the use of different intervention strategies to reduce drug overdose deaths considers opioid substitution treatment to be the most

These ranged from simple information dissemination, through counselling on overdose risks and prevention, to initiation or continuation of substitution treatment in prison.
However, activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five (Latvia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden).
In Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, prison interventions are among the predominant approaches to a reduction in acute drug deaths.
Information, education and communication (IEC)-oriented responses are further important measures in most European countries.
The dissemination of risk awareness messages and overdose management instructions via specifically developed printed materials or other media (flyers, websites, mass media campaigns) is common or predominant in 19 countries.
However, seven countries (Estonia, France, Ireland, Latvia, Hungary, Malta, Finland) use such measures rarely, and one country (Sweden) not at all.

Chapter 8Improving the monitoring of problem consumption and multiple drug consumption
European drug situation. Increasingly, we are seeing a more complex picture with respect to chronic drug problems in Europe.
To keep its relevance to a changing world of illicit drugs, the monitoring task has to move forward and meet the challenges of covering a broader spectrum of drugs, and covering their use in finer detail than it has to date.
Drug addiction, drug dependence, drug abuse, harmful use, problem use: there are a variety of concepts associated with the EMCDDA problem drug use indicator, each carrying its own subtle distinctions in medical or social dimensions.
The EMCDDA indicator of problem drug use (PDU) monitors ‘injecting drug use or long-duration/regular use of heroin, cocaine and/or amphetamines’.
Included in the definition, by convention, is the use of other opioids such as methadone.
The enlargement of the EU has embraced a greater variety of social behaviours, with illicit drug use no exception.
Developments within the drug culture, the rise of synthetic drugs and illicitly used medicines, the shift towards cocaine and the general high prevalence of cannabis use all have to be acknowledged in the understanding of what constitutes the needs of those with problems associated with their use of drugs.
It can be noted from earlier sections of this report that, although heroin users still clearly predominate in demands to the drug treatment services, the picture is changing with respect to those who are entering treatment for the first time, among whom reported cannabis and stimulant problems have been increasing (Figure 14).
This definition of PDU is a purely behavioural one based on drug consumption patterns and does not explicitly measure problems in any sense.
Nonetheless, it is linked to the various concepts of addiction by the understanding that someone behaving in this way is very likely to fall within the more general concept of a ‘problem user’.
It is important to note in this respect that the PDU indicator estimates only an important subgroup of those who can be thought of as having a drug problem of some form.
Nevertheless, the approach does have value. As a behaviourally determined concept, its virtues are that:
• it is relatively easy to operationalise in research studies;
• it groups together different types of drugs and modes of administration as alternatives, without specifically differentiating between them.
This changing position must be seen against the background of greatly expanded treatment provision for those with opioid-related problems as well as increased reporting coverage of treatment services.
Opioid substitution treatment in particular, locking people into long-term continuous care (note that this is not shown in these diagrams, which show only those entering treatment in the current year), emphasises the role of opioids in current treatment burden as compared with new treatment entrants.
Nonetheless, in many countries it appears that those developing a drug problem today in Europe are likely to be, in terms of the substances they are using at least, more heterogeneous than has historically been the case.
The PDU indicator and counting hidden populations of drug users
Historically speaking, the EMCDDA monitoring indicator was a child of its time — during the 1980s, and to a large extent the 1990s, heroin use and injecting drug use were seen as key components of the drug problem that required estimation.
Furthermore, these forms of drug use could not be measured convincingly by survey techniques.
The addition of amphetamines made the definition appropriate for some of the Nordic countries where injecting amphetamine use was important; and, although cocaine was included, in practice it was rarely a significant component in any estimates.
While the PDU indicator still gives us a useful window on an important element of the drug problem, it is increasingly apparent that it needs further development to meet the requirements of monitoring today’s more heterogeneous
Chapter 8: Improving the monitoring of problem consumption and multiple drug consumption
In terms of the current implementation of the PDU indicator across the EU, countries have adapted the definition to cover the practicalities of their local situation and the position is therefore heterogeneous.
Nine countries essentially follow the EMCDDA definition as it stands, 11 countries estimate only the number of opioid (or heroin) users and a further four countries do not exclude problem cannabis users although cannabis users in general form only a very small part of their estimates (criteria for including cannabis users being quite strict in terms of counting only dependent or very intensive use).

Earlier in this report a separate estimate of heroin use and injecting in Europe was provided for the first time.
In addition, we note the increase in treatment availability for opioid problems, with estimates of over half a million opioid substitution treatments in Europe.
This suggests that the proportion of heroin users and injectors having or having had contact with treatment services may be quite large in many countries.
The EMCDDA is currently exploring with its national technical groups what value can be added by bringing together information on treatment demand, treatment availability, and estimates of heroin use and injecting drug use.
Moving beyond the PDU indicator
A further step in developing our ability to understand better the European drug problem is to explore the extent to which intensive drug use can be incorporated into the monitoring exercise, beyond PDU monitoring.
The extent to which intensive drug use, however it is defined, is associated with dependence and levels and types of problems requires further elaboration, and, for example, Kandel and Davis (1992) estimated that in the USA around one third of daily all these approaches measurement is grounded in the idea that a percentage of problem drug users are ‘administratively visible’ as they are in contact with a range of treatment, legal and emergency, and social services, and from this visible minority the size of the population can be estimated if the percentage is known.
These kinds of indirect statistical methods complement population survey work, which, for a range of methodological and practical reasons, is less suitable for estimating the prevalence of drug use that is of low prevalence, stigmatised and largely hidden.
Annual report 2006: the state of the drugs problem in Europe of problematic and dependent use are included, these complexities increase further and very few robust data exist at a European level to permit informed analysis.
Nonetheless, it is likely that some countries have a sizeable population of chronic problem drug users, who are difficult to classify by primary substance and who may be experiencing problems due to their use of both licit and illicit substances.
Addressing this problem requires developing a better understanding of the patterns of polydrug use and applying this to improve national and European-level reporting.
Poly-substitution cannabis users could be considered to be dependent.
The way forward in this area requires the formalising of the concept of frequent, intensive use of cannabis and other illicit drugs as a specific target for monitoring.
Frequent or intensive use can be measured in survey data to complement its estimation through indirect statistical methods.
Currently, survey data provide a useful window on different patterns of cannabis use, but these are largely restricted behavioural and frequency of use measures.
Survey data are likely to be important if we are to develop robust estimates of the number of users of drugs such as cannabis who could be described as dependent or harmful users, at least by self-report.
Within the general concept of multiple drug use, several specific meanings of the term must be considered. At one extreme, there is the use of several substances in an intensive and chaotic way, simultaneously or consecutively, in many cases each drug substituting for another according to availability.
For instance, this is the case with problem users who use different opioids, as well as pharmaceuticals, cocaine, amphetamines and alcohol.
This move to defining frequent, intensive use more formally for a range of drugs would also assist the development of research tools to assess levels of problems and dependence related to different levels and patterns of cannabis consumption.
A number of European countries are working on developing methodological tools for measuring both intensive use and levels of dependence and problems, and the EMCDDA is promoting collaboration in this area of work.
This pattern of use seems to exist among some chronic users, possibly among marginalised groups, possibly among people with psychiatric conditions.
In many recording systems in Europe, these cases will be attributed to opioids.
However, there remains a further question of whether this intensive, chaotic polydrug use is enough of an entity in itself — a drug non-specific addiction therefore requiring targeted epidemiological measurements and treatment, support or harm reduction in a particularly difficult situation.
Under these circumstances, any monitoring of the component parts of problem drug use would need to include polydrug use as one of these separately measured components.
A complication of identifying intensive use as an indicator of those who are likely to be most at risk of becoming dependent or experiencing problems is that the notion of what constitutes intensive use is to some extent drug specific.
Although problem opioid use is strongly characterised by daily patterns of use, this is often not the case for stimulant drugs.
With these drugs, binge consumption is often more common, use escalating for short periods and then decreasing, often with the users switching to other drugs or alcohol to alleviate the adverse consequences of abstaining.
Both pharmacological and contextual factors may be important in influencing patterns of intensive drug use, but it is clear that behavioural measures of intensive use will need to be sensitive to different patterns of drug use associated with different types of drug.
The challenge of reporting polydrug use problems
For good practical and methodological reasons most reporting on drug use describes each substance separately.
This provides the conceptual clarity necessary to facilitate reporting based on the behavioural measures available, but it ignores the fact that individual drug users will often have consumed or be consuming a range of both illicit and licit substances and these users may also be experiencing problems with more than one drug.
They may substitute one drug type for another or may change their drug of choice over time or may use them complementarily. This kind of complexity is extremely challenging to a monitoring system even if analysis is restricted to simple behavioural measures of drug consumption in different time periods.
A second drug with a functional or pharmacological rationale is not confined to simultaneous use but may also be used consecutively, as a replacement or as a complementary drug.
In other cases, a second drug may be used for its compensating pharmacological effect: this is the case when the narcotic effect of opioids is modified by using cocaine, or when the anxiety effect of cocaine or amphetamines is placated by the use of opioids or other depressants.
Chapter 8: Improving the monitoring of problem consumption and multiple drug consumption
Increased risks through polydrug use
The potentiating effect of one drug on another is sometimes considerable, and here the licit drugs and medicines — such as alcohol, nicotine and antidepressants — have to be considered in conjunction with the controlled psychoactive substances.
The risk level will depend on the dosage level of both substances.
Concerns exist about a number of pharmacological pairings: alcohol and cocaine increase cardiovascular toxicity; alcohol or depressant drugs, when taken with opioids, lead to an increased risk of overdose; and opioids or cocaine taken with ecstasy or amphetamines also result in additional acute toxicity.
Survey results do show considerable use of more than two drugs by individuals in the same time period.
However, survey data often poorly report on some forms of drug use and, even where there are data, work needs to be done to develop comparable reporting standards.
An example of the extent of polydrug use data available from population surveys can be seen in a recent technical report of the EMCDDA (2005b).
Taking the example of data from Spain, Figure 15 shows that use of one drug results in an increased tendency, compared to that of the general population, to have used another and that this varies according to the drug considered.
For example, among heroin users, the use of cocaine is relatively common, but use of other drugs is less apparent for cocaine users.
Limits of the data available on polydrug use
Developing an operational definition of polydrug use: a question of timing?
The absence of available data limits reporting on many aspects of polydrug use.
Data are available from toxicological reports from drug overdoses and self-reports from those attending treatment services.
While these sources allow some insights into polydrug use, the information available is often limited and the representativeness of the data needs to be considered.
Consideration needs to be given to what time periods are selected for assessing and reporting on polydrug use.
Lifetime prevalence rates are in general not likely to be very useful or relevant to public health issues compared with measures of more recent use.

No single reporting instrument can adequately encompass this complexity.
Polydrug use could be usefully defined operationally as the frequent use of more than one substance over a minimum specified time period, for example one month.
As such, it is an important component in understanding the European drug problem as a whole.
However, a clear need now exists to complement the PDU indicator’s overall estimates with substance-specific component estimates in order to address Europe’s increasingly heterogeneous drug problem.
Given that many of the data sources available are based on behavioural reports of drug consumption, the concept of frequent or intensive use needs to be developed on this basis.
This will widen the perspective for monitoring drug problems beyond that currently found in the PDU indicator.
Locating the PDU information alongside this broader information set will also represent a step forward in the EMCDDA’s efforts to improve its overall understanding of both the scale and the nature of drug problems in Europe.
In parallel, work needs to advance on developing reporting standards that enable patterns of polydrug use to be better described at the European level.
The first steps in this direction include developing a more sophisticated conceptual framework for looking at different types of multiple drug consumption — including the adoption of appropriate temporal frameworks — and identifying appropriate data sources.

Drug-related infectious diseases and drug-related deaths
This is the 12th annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.
Like previous reports, it provides a comprehensive update on the current situation regarding drug use in Europe.
It also demonstrates Europe’s achievement in implementing a methodologically sound, sustainable and comprehensive information system to monitor drug use.
enforcement.
It is not hard to find areas that arouse special concern.
Nonetheless, we feel strongly that it is also important to acknowledge progress where it has been made.
In Europe, more and more Member States are adopting strategic and planned approaches to tackling the drugs problem.
There has also been a dramatic increase in investment in prevention, treatment and harm-reduction activities and improved cooperation and increased focus in supply reduction.
Drug use in general remains at historically high levels, but it has stabilised in most areas, and in some areas there are even signs that merit cautious optimism.
The European Union and its Member States give considerable support to international programmes and, in a global context, it is satisfying to observe that, in a number of important areas, the European situation looks relatively positive.
The report addresses two fundamental questions.
What is known about drug use in Europe and the problems it causes?
And what has been learned about responding effectively to drug-related problems?
These questions are important because, regardless of political persuasion or ideological position, policymakers across Europe have come to recognise that the drugs problem presents a complex set of issues for which there is no simple solution.
They recognise that the way forward lies in analysing the available evidence regarding both the size and nature of the problem and the costs and benefits of different intervention approaches.
In this respect, the report also demonstrates Europe’s commitment to balanced and evidence-based policymaking and to sustained effort over time rather than relying on ‘quick-fix’ solutions.
As a result, Europe can be proud that its response to this difficult and often emotive issue is both rational and humane.
As a monitoring agency, we deal in facts and figures; we are committed to being scientifically rigorous and impartial, interpreting the information available without prejudice or prior position.
This is our role, and as Chairman of the Management Board and Director we accept no compromise on this position and take pride in the high standards we maintain.
But while scientific rigour is essential to our work, we must never forget that behind the figures we report are real human beings whose lives have been affected and sometimes ruined by drug problems.
Behind the dry statistics on treatment demand, drug-related deaths and criminal behaviour are the grieving families, lost potential and children growing up in unsafe communities.
To develop effective responses to the drugs problem requires us to be dispassionate about our data, but we must never become dispassionate about the topic.
In this report we also reflect on the progress that has been made in responding to the drugs problem in Europe.
This is particularly pertinent this year, as both in Europe and internationally we will soon be reflecting on achievements in this area.
In 2008, the European Commission will begin its task of assessing the impact of the current European action plan on drugs and the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) will debate the progress made in meeting the goals set at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session in 1998.

Reitox national focal points
Reitox is the European information network on drugs and drug addiction.
The network is made up of national focal points in the EU Member States, Norway, the candidate countries and at the European Commission.
Under the responsibility of their governments, the focal points are the national authorities providing drug information to the EMCDDA.
The contact details of the national focal points may be found at: http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/?nnodeid=1596
This annual report is based on information provided to the EMCDDA by the EU Member States and candidate countries and Norway (participating in the work of the EMCDDA since 2001) in the form of a national report.
The statistical data reported here relate to the year 2005 (or the last year available).
Graphics and tables in this report may reflect a subset of EU countries: the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest.
An online version of the annual report is available in 23 languages and may be found at http://annualreport.emcdda.europa.eu
The 2007 statistical bulletin (http://stats07.emcdda.europa.eu) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based.
It also provides further detail on the methodology used and over 100 additional statistical graphs.
Country data profiles (http://dataprofiles07.emcdda.europa.eu) provide a top-level, graphical summary of key aspects of the drug situation for each country.
Three in-depth reviews accompany this report and explore the following issues:
• Drugs and driving;
• Drug use among minors;
• Cocaine and crack cocaine: a growing public health issue.
The selected issues are available in print and online (http://issues07.emcdda.europa.eu) in English only.
The national reports of the Reitox focal points give a detailed description and analysis of the drugs problem in each country and are available on the EMCDDA website (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/?nnodeid=435).
Europe plays an increasingly important role in supporting global actions to reduce drug problems
Neither trends in the use of drugs nor those who are involved in drug production and trafficking respect national or geographic boundaries.
It is therefore important to recognise that the European drug problem is part of a broader global phenomenon, with patterns of drug use in Europe both affected by and affecting the problem elsewhere.
This is recognised in the current EU action plan on drugs, which addresses the need for greater European coordination on international affairs and the need to support programmes to reduce drug demand and supply in neighbouring and producer countries.
European investment in support of international actions is now considerable, with a recent European Commission audit suggesting that the European Union is now funding demand and supply reduction measures in third countries to the tune of at least EUR 750 million.
Moreover, the EU is now the major international donor supporting the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
parts of the world is relatively comprehensive and robust information available.
The USA, Canada and Australia can provide meaningful comparison points on estimates for last year drug prevalence.
UNODC estimates show that the prevalence of opioid use in these countries is broadly similar to that in the European Union, ranging between 0.4% and 0.6% of the adult population, with Canada slightly lower and the USA slightly higher.
Estimated cannabis use is, on average, considerably lower in the European Union than in the USA, Canada or Australia.
As regards stimulant drugs, levels of ecstasy use are broadly similar worldwide, although Australia reports high prevalence levels, and, in the case of amphetamine, prevalence is higher in Australia and the USA than in Europe and Canada.
The prevalence of cocaine use is higher in the USA and Canada than in the European Union and Australia.
A lack of comparable data makes it difficult to assess the health impact of drug use across countries, although a cautious comparison of estimated rates of newly diagnosed HIV infections related to drug injecting in 2005 suggests rates in Australia, Canada and the European Union at below 10 cases per million population, and around 36 cases per million in the USA.
Quantifying complexity: setting meaningful targets and developing useful summary measures
In addition to financial support, there is also evidence that European countries have taken seriously the commitments made at international level to develop appropriate responses to drug problems.
To complement the data available at international level, the EMCDDA will support the review process by providing a more detailed assessment of the European situation. As can be seen in the data presented in this report, over the last 10 years EU Member States have developed increasingly comprehensive national and EU-level coordination mechanisms, usually based around strategies and action plans.
In addition, they have dramatically improved the information available on the drug situation and increased investment in both supply-side and demand-side interventions.
While acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe, it is also important to recognise these positive developments.
The objective of all European drug strategies is to reduce drug use and the damage that drugs can cause, both to those who use them and the communities in which they live.
This policy objective can be simply stated, but it is important to recognise that drug use is a multifaceted and complex phenomenon and any attempt to evaluate the impact of policies in this area has to reflect this underlying reality.
A positive conclusion of this report is that European drug policies are becoming more sensitive to the need to focus on specific activities and develop meaningful targets.
This is reflected in the general shift in Europe towards national drug strategies being accompanied by more specific and time-limited action plans, and, at the level of European coordination, in the annual review of the current EU action plan on drugs, with indicators being dropped or modified following review of their performance.
Drug use is a global problem, and a useful insight into the relative size of the drug problem in Europe can be gained by comparing European data with information from other countries. The difficulty here is that only in a few other

The general principle that those in prison should have access to the same healthcare options as are available in the wider community is not achieved in many areas for those with drug problems.
Not only do many of those entering prison have drug problems, but studies show that drug use often continues in prison.
The lack of services for drug users in prison raises the serious concern that not only is an opportunity being lost to intervene to reduce future drug use and offending behaviour but also that health gains achieved elsewhere may be undermined by a lack of services in this setting.
Among the advances that may be helpful in this direction is the development of indexes that try to capture the different costs and harms of using illicit drugs, such as the drug harm index developed recently in the United Kingdom.
Harm is also one of the key concepts included in the UNODC’s recently proposed illicit drug index (IDI).
These sorts of approaches may prove useful in the future for policy analysis purposes, but they are dependent on the quality of data on which the composite measure is based and on the extent to which these data can encompass the target concept.
Increasingly, the focus of the debate on demand reduction activities of all types is on identifying those interventions for which there is evidence of effectiveness and which do not deliver unintended negative consequences.
As any intervention, if badly delivered, is unlikely to be effective or may even be counterproductive, a second plank of this work is to identify good practice and quality control measures.
The new regulation of the EMCDDA emphasises the importance of identifying and disseminating good practice.
A key difficulty here is the real world settings in which demand reduction interventions are applied.
Credible controlled studies, the gold standard for most medical interventions, are often difficult to design or simply impracticable.
The complexities of assessing evidence for effectiveness and identifying quality control standards are addressed in this report.
Cannabis: popularity may have peaked — as recognition of public health issues grows
There are still considerable differences between European countries in the nature and scale of their national drug problems and also in the range and configuration of response.
Despite this, there is considerable agreement on more general fundamentals: that drug policies should be balanced, comprehensive and evidence based.
In the area of demand reduction, the need for prevention, treatment and social rehabilitation activities is accepted by all.
But, historically, the topic of harm reduction has been more controversial.
This is changing, and harm reduction as part of a comprehensive package of demand reduction measures now appears to have become a more explicit part of the European approach.
This is evident in the fact that both opioid substitution treatment and needle and syringe exchange programmes are now found in virtually all EU Member States, although the level of service provision varies considerably.
It is also evident in a recent report from the European Commission, which found that the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 had played a role in encouraging Member States to develop and expand harm-reduction activities.
Nearly a quarter of all adults have tried cannabis at some time in their lives, and one in 14 will have used it in the last year, making it the most commonly consumed illicit drug in Europe.
But, even more so than among the population in general, it is by far the most commonly consumed illicit drug by young and very young people.
Drug use among those who are developing both physically and socially can be a particular problem, and this issue is dealt with in detail in the accompanying selected issue on drug use in minors.
An important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that, despite advances made in other areas, services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison settings.
Although some Member States have introduced schemes to divert offenders with drug problems into treatment as an alternative to criminal sanctions, those with drug problems continue to account for a significant
At a glance — estimates of drug use in Europe possession.
(Note that these estimates relate to the adult population and are the most recent estimates available.
For complete data and full methodological notes see the 2007 statistical bulletin.)
Lifetime prevalence: at least 70 million, or one in five European adults
Last year use: about 23 million European adults or one third of lifetime users
Lifetime prevalence: at least 12 million, or around 4 % of European adults
Last year use: 4.5 million European adults or one third of lifetime users
Despite considerable public and media debate on the topic, it is hard to see any direct or simple relationship between law enforcement policies and overall prevalence of cannabis use.
Although there were differences in timing and scale between countries, Europe saw a substantial increase in the use of cannabis during the 1990s, followed by a more stable but generally still increasing trend after 2000.
This has produced a more homogeneous European picture now than has historically been the case.
In addition, the most recent data suggest that, particularly in the high-prevalence countries, cannabis use is moving into a more stable phase or even decreasing.
And, although the data are still relatively weak, there is some evidence that the popularity of the drug among the younger age groups is decreasing in some countries.
Although national trends vary overall, it is possible to be cautiously optimistic that the escalation of cannabis use that has been seen in Europe since the 1990s may now have reached its peak.
Problem opioids use: between one and eight cases per 1 000 adult population (aged 15–64)
Over 7 500 acute drug deaths, with opioids being found in around 70 % of them (2004 data)
It also appears that the needs of cannabis users coming into contact with treatment services are varied, as indeed are the responses that are being provided — which range from brief and prevention-orientated interventions to more formal treatment approaches.
Despite this, over the period 2000–05, recorded cannabis offences increased considerably (36 %) and, in most countries, cannabis is the drug most likely to be involved in charges for drug use or
The European cannabis situation is also complicated by market factors, and this problem is confounded by the lack of good data on the relative share and availability of different cannabis products in the EU.
Europe remains the main global market for cannabis resin, most of which is produced in North Africa. Herbal cannabis is also available in Europe,
Coordinated actions against cocaine trafficking are growing in Europe, and a new intergovernmental task force is to be located in Portugal, which appears appropriate given the country’s growing importance in cocaine interdiction.
Although record seizures do not appear to have affected price trends, which are still downwards, they may have had an influence on purity levels.
Cannabis use raises a complex set of issues for drug, public health and social policy in Europe.
One positive development is that Member States now appear to be beginning to develop a better understanding of the implications of the widespread use of this drug and the debate is becoming more focused and less prone to either under- or overstatement of the problem.
To date, increased levels of cocaine consumption have had only a modest impact on health-related indicators, but this may be changing.
Each year, around 400 cocaine-related deaths are reported in Europe, and there is a suspicion that cardiovascular deaths in which cocaine has been an aggravating factor may go largely undetected.
Requests for drug treatment for those with cocaine problems are rising.
In 2005, cocaine was the primary drug of about 13 % of clients demanding treatment, and in an even higher proportion of those new to treatment (22 %).
The number of new treatment demands reported has roughly tripled over the last five years, and now stands at over 33 000.
Cocaine was also reported as a secondary drug in around 15 % of cases, and there is a growing awareness that concurrent cocaine use is complicating the treatment of opioid problems in some countries.
However, overall cocaine treatment requests are lower than those related to cannabis and considerably lower than for opioid problems.
HIV: overall assessment positive, but new infections underline the need for continued efforts
The EMCDDA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year, up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report.
Although recent increases mean that more countries now report a significant cocaine-using population, inter-country variation remains high, with low rates of cocaine use reported in most countries in eastern Europe.
During the 1990s, the experience, or potential threat, of a widespread HIV epidemic among drug injectors was a catalyst for the development of services for this group.
With the expansion of services, the HIV epidemics seen earlier in Europe have largely been avoided, although localised problems have been observed in some countries, notably the Baltic States, and in some countries affected by earlier epidemics, HIV prevalence rates among injectors have remained quite high.
Overall, while injecting drug use has declined as a route of HIV transmission, the EMCDDA estimates that, in 2005, it accounted for around 3 500 newly diagnosed cases of HIV in the European Union.
This figure may be low by historical standards, but it still represents a considerable public health problem.
Increased prevalence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom, the two countries with the highest prevalence in Europe — although in neither case are the increases dramatic.
In both countries, last year prevalence rates among young adults are similar to or greater than those found in the USA.
Worryingly, in both countries, cocaine use among the young is relatively high (4–6% in 15- to 16-year-olds).
In Spain, analysis suggests that the recent increase has been driven by use in the 15–24 age group.
It is important to note that estimates of those experiencing serious problems with cocaine are far lower.
Although estimates of problem cocaine use are available for only three countries (Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom), the figure ranges between 0.3% and 0.6% of the adult population.
Other indicators also demonstrate an upward trend, confirming the growing importance of cocaine in Europe’s drug problem.
Both quantities and numbers of seizures have increased, perhaps reflecting increased targeting of
Analysis of the most recent data suggests that, in most countries, rates of new infection related to injecting are low and that, in most EU regions, HIV prevalence among injectors fell between 2001 and 2005.
As a result, especially in areas where prevalence has been high, the burden of infection resulting from injecting drug use is likely to be decreasing.
The situation in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania remains a
Commentary — the drug situation in Europe concern, but here again most of the recent data point to a relative decrease in new infections.
(HCV) — including a significant proportion who are no longer using drugs.
Hepatitis C can have serious health consequences, including cancer and death, and meeting the needs of people infected with HCV is likely to put an increasing strain on health budgets.
Across Europe, HCV rates are high among injecting populations, and studies show that young injectors continue to acquire this disease early in their drug-using careers, limiting the opportunities for intervention.
Unlike hepatitis B, where interventions appear to be delivering benefits, no clear trend is evident in the HCV data, although differences between countries may provide some clues as to what might constitute effective actions in this area.
Important caveats to this assessment are that data in some important areas are weak and that studies of time trends over the last five years have reported increases in some areas or samples in about one third of countries.
In addition, there is cause for concern in a few countries either because of relatively high levels of new infections or because there has been some small recent increase in prevalence even though overall rates remain low.
Given that recent history demonstrates how quickly HIV problems can spread in vulnerable populations, this underlines the need to continue to target and develop services to engage with those who are at risk.
Hepatitis C remains Europe’s hidden epidemic
The EMCDDA estimates that there could be as many as 200 000 Europeans living with HIV infection who are current or past drug injectors. While there is good public awareness of the HIV risks posed by injecting, it is important to remember that there are also an estimated 1 million some-time injectors who are infected with hepatitis C virus
It is estimated that potential global heroin production, mostly in Afghanistan, increased again in 2006, to over 600 tonnes.
This raises the question for Europe: what effect will this increase have on the drug problem?
Afghanistan — can alternative development measures have an impact?
The sustainability of the general stable or improving situation seen in heroin use in Europe is called into question by increasing opium production in Afghanistan.
Estimates for 2006 suggest that production increased by 43 % as a result of a substantial increase in the area under cultivation.
Opioid seizures and laboratories dismantled seem to indicate that opium produced in Afghanistan is increasingly being transformed into morphine or heroin in the country itself, before being exported (CND, 2007).
In contrast, in other parts of the eastern region, levels of cultivation are likely to remain negligible, and even in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand reductions in cultivation can be expected in areas close to the provincial centre.
The supporting factors here appear to be greater governmental control and more diversification in agricultural production, factors which have allowed relatively high-value crops to be established together with the introduction of a transportation and marketing infrastructure.
In the north and north-east of the country, not only have increasing wage rates and falling opium prices deterred poppy planting, but also some high-value vegetables actually generate greater returns than poppies.
In these areas, crop diversification has been supported by counter-narcotics efforts and greater governmental involvement — leading to a general perception that opium prohibition measures will be enforced.
Rising labour costs and falling prices now mean that returns on opium poppy are not unassailable and, in some areas, higher incomes can be generated from alternative products, particularly where other non-farm income opportunities also exist.
These legal income opportunities are, however, not open to all and, in many areas, farmers’ options are limited by high transport costs, poor roads and problems arising from lack of security.
In these areas, corruption and insecurity are reducing the opportunities for trading in legal goods and impeding economic growth and efforts to encourage crop diversification, even in areas relatively close to the provincial centres.
Regional differences inside Afghanistan point to the potential for economic growth to reduce poppy cultivation but also show how it can be undermined by the lack of political security, corruption and infrastructure problems.
Reductions in cultivation can be achieved quickly but are reversed equally quickly.
For example, in Nangarhar province, in the east of the country, the level of opium poppy cultivation fell by 96 % in 2004/05, but there, as in many other districts, it has since returned to previous levels, in part driven by the economic needs of densely populated areas that have been unable to diversify to other high-value crops and non-farm income opportunities (Mansfield, personal communication and 2007).
Annual report 2007: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Downward trend in drug overdose deaths tails off
The EMCDDA reports regularly on acute drug-related deaths in Europe — these are principally overdose deaths, usually involving heroin or other opioids, although in most cases a range of substances will have been consumed.
Overdose deaths constitute a significant cause of avoidable mortality among young adults.
of drug treatment data and drug overdoses suggests that the heroin-using population in Europe continues to age, although the picture in eastern European countries is less clear.
Overall estimates of problem drug use also generally point to a stable situation.
Nonetheless, the falling price of the drug and the increase in the number of young heroin users in treatment in some countries underlines the need for continued vigilance.
Since 2000, many EU countries have reported decreases in the numbers of drug-related deaths, possibly reflecting increased service provision or changes in the numbers of injecting heroin users.
However, this trend has not continued in 2004 and 2005.
Particularly of concern is the fact that in a few countries the proportion of younger people among those dying has been growing.
Reducing drug-related deaths is an important public health target and the reasons for the faltering in the downward trend needs to be identified.
Although there is currently no clear-cut evidence that heroin use is gaining popularity with young people, there are indications from a variety of reports that the use of synthetic opioids may be a growing problem in some parts of Europe, and that synthetic opioids may even be replacing heroin in some countries.
In Austria, a growing proportion of treatment demand clients are under 25 and are seeking help for problems due to the use of opioids diverted from legitimate uses.
Similarly, Belgium reports some increase in the illicit use of methadone; and in Denmark, methadone is commonly mentioned in reports on drug-related deaths.
Buprenorphine, a drug regarded by some as having a low appeal on the illicit market, is also reported to be increasingly used and injected in the Czech Republic; it may have replaced heroin in Finland; and monitoring in France raises concerns about the illicit use of this drug, including injecting use by young people, who have initiated their opioid use with buprenorphine rather than heroin.
Death by overdose is not the only health risk facing those with drug problems.
Studies reveal that excess mortality from all causes is considerable among problem drug users: as much as 10 times what would be expected in the general population.
There is therefore a need to develop a more comprehensive approach to addressing both the physical and mental health needs of this group if the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic drug use is to be significantly reduced.
Cyprus, Latvia and Romania, have incorporated detailed implementation processes in their drug strategies and action plans.
This approach, which has been in place in other Member States (e.g. Spain, Ireland, the United Kingdom) for some time, is becoming more widespread and has also been implemented in the current EU action plan on drugs.
In 2006, new drug strategies or action plans were adopted by four Member States (Greece, Poland, Portugal, Sweden) and Turkey, as well as Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.
In none of these cases was this the first such exercise, and in each of these cases the national reports mentioned that the new drug policy documents had benefited from the experience of earlier ones.
In 2007, two Member States, Malta and Austria, as well as Norway, are due to adopt new drug strategies, while the Czech Republic, Estonia, France and Hungary will implement new action plans.
In this chapter, drug policies in the EU as a whole and in individual Member States, as well as the relationship between these two levels of policymaking, are described.
A data collection exercise brought forward by the EMCDDA in the reporting period permits an overview of current national drug strategies and institutional frameworks across Europe.
Estimating the cost of drugs to society is discussed in a section on drug-related public expenditure.
Based on data on national public expenditure reported by Member States, a first approximation is made of the total amount spent by European governments on the drugs phenomenon.
Legislative changes focusing on supply reduction and on legal approaches to drug testing are described in a section on recent changes in national laws.
An overview of the latest statistics on drug law offences and trends in offences involving opioids and cannabis are presented in a section on drug-related crime.
The chapter concludes with a section on drug-related research in Europe.
National drug strategies
General situation and new developments
In early 2007, all EU Member States, except Italy, Malta and Austria, had a national drug strategy, sometimes accompanied by an action plan.
At that time, a total of more than 35 different national drug planning documents were in force in Europe, covering a time period ranging from as little as two years (Czech action plan) to more than 10 years (Dutch national drug strategy).
Reducing drug use in general and problem drug use in particular is a key objective of the national drug strategies and action plans of all EU Member States, candidate countries and Norway.
The objective of preventing and reducing the individual and collective harm resulting from the use of drugs is also shared by all countries.
Another common feature is the ‘comprehensive’ approach, whereby interventions aimed at drug supply reduction and those aimed at drug demand reduction are linked.
The ‘balanced’ approach, which aims to give priority both to supply reduction and to demand reduction, is also very widespread.
All these elements are also part of the EU drugs strategy.
A noticeable trend in recent years has been the shift from a single national planning document to the adoption of two complementary instruments: a strategic framework and an action plan.
This approach, which allows a better conceptualisation of short-, mid- and long-term objectives, is now used in almost half of EU Member States, and is even more common in those that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007: eight of these 12 countries have both a drug strategy and an action plan.
The policy of combining a drug strategy with action plans facilitates more detailed definitions of objectives, actions, responsibilities and deadlines. Some countries, for example
The range of psychoactive substances included in national drug strategies is an area in which notable differences are found among European countries. This can be seen in the new documents adopted in 2006.
Of these, two mainly address illicit drugs (Poland, Portugal), albeit with some links between the drug and the alcohol/tobacco strategies, two address both illicit drugs and alcohol (Greece, Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom) and one (Turkey) addresses all addictive substances. In addition, Sweden has simultaneously adopted two interlinked action plans,
New regulation of the EMCDDA enable the agency to provide a more complete picture of the drug phenomenon.
On 12 December 2006, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union signed the recasted regulation of the EMCDDA, which came into force in January 2007.
The new regulation underlines the importance of the key indicators, and notes that their implementation is a prerequisite for the Centre to perform its duties.
Emphasis is also given to the need to develop an information system that is sensitive to new and emerging trends.
The new regulation places stronger emphasis on collaboration with partner agencies, particularly Europol in the case of monitoring new psychoactive substances, and other partners such as the WHO, the UN or relevant statistical authorities to attain maximum efficiency.
The new regulation clarifies the countries to which the EMCDDA can transfer its know-how, at the request of the European Commission and with the approval of the Management Board.
The new document broadens the scope of the EMCDDA’s remit.
Particular reference is now made to providing information on the combined use of licit and illicit psychoactive substances and on best practice in Member States.
The EMCDDA can also develop tools and instruments to help Member States monitor and evaluate national drug policies and to help the European Commission do the same at EU level.
All these new elements will
The role of the Reitox network of national focal points is more clearly defined in the new document.
The recast also modifies the regulation regarding the Scientific Committee.
This will provide the agency with a cohesive, independent body of eminent scientists.
In addition to helping to ensure the quality of the work of the EMCDDA, it will also provide a bridge to the wider scientific and research community.
Moves towards the integration of licit and illicit drugs policies have been evident in some countries for several years (e.g. Germany,
to know if their policies are implemented and if the expected outcomes are achieved.
In two Member States (Belgium, Slovenia), the scope of the evaluation has been limited to a number of selected projects.
In most other countries, and at EU level, the implementation of the actions set out in the national drug strategy is systematically monitored.
This enables progress reviews to be carried out, the findings of which may be used to improve or renew existing drug strategies or action plans.
National drug strategies and action plans generally include interventions in the areas of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, harm reduction and supply reduction. The extent of the different interventions and the importance given
2 to each of them varies, however, between countries (
Global evaluations, covering process, output, outcome and impact, are less frequent in Europe.
Some countries (Estonia, Greece, Spain, Poland, Sweden) report on the planning of an internal evaluation based on implementation progress reviews and other available epidemiological and criminological data.
Evaluation
Having in the EU a diversity of national drug strategies with common objectives can be viewed as a strength because it allows comparative analysis of different types of approach.
The evaluation of national drug strategies and action plans is therefore important not only for assessing the efforts at national level but also for improving the overall understanding of the effectiveness of drug strategies.
The EU and its Member States have already invested significant resources in this field.
Almost all European countries mention the objective of evaluating their national drug strategy.
Governments want
The next step, which is developing outcome and impact evaluations, is still in its early stages, and the future impact assessment of the EU drug action plan 2005–08, for which the European Commission has commissioned a study aimed at designing a methodology, could become an example.
There is also some activity in the area of developing indexes designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation.
See the 2006 selected issue ‘European drug policies: extended beyond illicit drugs?’.See Chapter 2.
Annual report 2007: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Drug policy indexes countries (e.g. Finland, Portugal), coordination at regional or local level is directly supervised by the national coordination bodies.
Comparative analysis of drug coordination mechanisms in the EU is made difficult by the diversity of existing systems.
However, a study commissioned by the EMCDDA has shown that it is possible to assess coordination systems by focusing on their ‘implementation quality’, a concept for studying their capacity to produce coordination outcomes (Kenis, 2006).
This approach will be further developed to enable it to be used in the evaluation of national drug coordination systems.
Drug-related public expenditure
The United Kingdom’s drug harm index (DHI) is designed to capture the social costs of harms generated by the problematic use of any illegal drug.
It covers four types of harms: health impacts, community harms, domestic drug-related crime and commercial drug-related crime.
However, it is not intended to be a full summary of the country’s drug situation, as the indicators are limited to those for which robust data already exist, and the outcome figures and trends are being used as a baseline against which to assess future progress (MacDonald et al., 2005).
The UNODC’s illicit drug index (IDI) combines three dimensions of the drug phenomenon: drug production, drug trafficking and drug abuse.
The outcome is an overall score, based on a ‘harm/risk factor per capita’, which should reflect the magnitude of all drug problems which arise in a given country (UNODC, 2005).
The conceptualisation of both instruments has involved interesting methodological developments and has allowed a first insight into the use of overall indexes to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations.
A first observation is that such instruments can be useful for a longitudinal follow-up of the national situation but that, to understand what is really going on, the result should be contextualised with the analysis of individual indicators within the indexes.
The use of an overall index for inter-country comparison could be more difficult given the limitations of existing data sets and the absence of contextual variables (e.g. geographical situation) from the analysis.
Coordination mechanisms
The high variability is partly explained by the different sizes of the Member States and partly by differences between countries in the types of expenditure reported and the completeness of the data. Most countries reported only expenditures incurred in connection with the implementation of national drug policy programmes, and did not detail other expenditures in the field of supply and demand reduction.
Furthermore, not all the main areas of State spending on the drug phenomenon were always included, with only 15 out of 23 countries providing detailed information on expenditure on ‘health and social care’ activities (treatment, harm reduction, health research, educational, prevention and social activities) and only 14 countries reporting on ‘law enforcement’ expenditure (police, army, law courts, prisons, customs and finance guard activities).
Information about expenditure in other areas (e.g. administration, coordination, monitoring and international cooperation) was even more scarce (seven countries), as was information on regional and municipal budgets (six countries).
Nevertheless, some general features can be described.
Most countries have drug coordination mechanisms at both national level and regional or local level. At the national level, there is usually an interministerial committee on drugs, which is often supplemented by a national drug coordination agency and/or a national drug coordinator who is responsible for the day-to-day coordination activities.
At the regional or local level, drug coordination agencies and/or drug coordinators exist in most countries.
Six countries provided detailed information of expenditure associated with tackling drugs (Table 1).
‘Law enforcement’ activities accounted for 24–77% of the total expenditure, while the remainder was spent on ‘health and social care’ activities.
European countries differ in how coordination mechanisms at the national level are linked to those at regional or local level.
In some countries, in particular those with a federal structure (e.g. Belgium, Germany), vertical coordination systems are used to allow cooperation between the different coordination bodies that are acting independently.
In other
This figure is likely to underestimate the full extent of drug-related public expenditure, given the high level of under-reporting. The six countries included in Table 1 account for 76 % of the total public expenditure reported by EU Member States
The public expenditure perspective
Studies on the costs of drug use can be an important source of information for the development and management of drug policies.
The term ‘public expenditure’ refers to the value of goods and services bought by the government of the State (i.e. central, regional, local) in order to execute each of its functions (i.e. healthcare, justice, public order, education, social services).
The analysis of a State’s public expenditure provides useful information regarding the ability of its government to spend effectively and efficiently. ciently.
Drug-related costs can be divided into two major categories: direct and indirect.
Direct costs are those for which payments are made, and typically include expenditure in the areas of prevention, treatment, harm reduction and law enforcement.
Indirect costs are the value of productive services not performed because of drug use, and typically consist of lost productivity due to drug-related morbidity and mortality.
Drug-related costs may also include the intangible costs of pain and suffering, usually in the form of quality of life measures, but this category of costs is often omitted because of the difficulty in accurately quantifying it in monetary terms.
A cost study may be conducted from several different perspectives, each of which might include different costs, for example costs to society as a whole, the government, the healthcare system, third-party payers, and drug users and their families.
The societal perspective
The estimation of drug-related public expenditure is a different exercise from that of estimating social costs.
Public expenditure represents only a proportion of social costs, mainly in the form of direct costs; indirect costs are explicitly excluded, as there are costs from private stakeholders (e.g. private health insurance companies).
Direct public expenditures explicitly labelled as ‘drug-related’ can be initially traced back by exhaustively reviewing official financial reporting documents (e.g. budgets or year-end reports).
Estimations are complicated when drug-related expenditures are not labelled as such but embedded in programmes with broader goals (e.g. overall police operations budget).
In this case, direct non-labelled drug-related expenses must be calculated through modelling approaches.
Drug-related social costs are the total of all the costs to society, direct and indirect, caused by drug use.
The output, expressed inmonetary terms, is an estimate of the total burden that drug use places on society (Single et al., 2001).
Determining the social cost of drug use has several benefits.
First, it reveals how much society is spending on drug-related issues and, implicitly, the amount that would be saved if drug use were completely abolished.
Second, it identifies the different components of cost and thesize of the contribution of each sector in society.
Such informationcan help to determine funding prioritiesby highlighting areas where inefficiencies may exist and savings can be made.
The primary aim of social cost calculations is to weigh the burden that drug problems pose on society against the cost to society of addressing these problems (including possible indirect effects).
Ultimately, this leads to the question of effectiveness and efficiency: do governments spend their money wisely on the right problems?
However, some authors (Reuter, 2006) have proposed that, for policy purposes, public expenditures are more relevant than social costs.
The drugs budget helps to describe what policies a government is using to reduce drug use and related problems, which is the first step towards deciding whether the level and content of such policies is adequate.
and Norway. Based on the data supplied by these six countries, the total drug-related public expenditure by European countries is calculated to lie somewhere between
In addition, as of 2005, the EC and the Member States had co-financed drug-related assistance projects in third countries to the value of over EUR 750 million.
At EU level, considerable funding will be provided by the European Commission to tackle the drugs issue under the new 2007–13 budget.
A new funding instrument for drugs prevention and information of EUR 21 million is under negotiation and may be adopted by the end of 2007, making EUR 3 million available for transnational projects this year.
Other new financial instruments, such as the prevention of and fight against crime programme,
In response to the EU drugs action plan 2005–08, the EMCDDA is currently working towards developing a methodology that will enable the Member States, candidate countries and Norway to compile standardised data on drug-related expenditure.
This will help the EMCDDA to estimate both the total public expenditure allocated to drugs and how this is divided between different activities.
Of the six countries, four (Hungary, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden) provided detailed modelled approaches of their figures.
Applying to the remaining countries the value of the first and third quartiles of the distribution of the percentage of total general government expenditure (0.18% and 0.69% respectively), and of the percentage of GDP (0.08% and 0.37% respectively) publicly spent by the six selected countries, provides an interval of the overall total accumulated expenditure.

EU legal and policy developments
At the end of 2006, the European Commission presented its first progress review (5) on the implementation of the EU drugs action plan (2005–08).
This assessed the extent to which the activities planned for 2006 were achieved and whether the plan’s objectives for 2006 have been fulfilled.
A similar exercise will take place in 2007, prior to the final impact assessment of the EU drug action plan that will be presented by the European Commission in 2008.
for drugs prevention and information 2007–13 (7), which has been proposed by the European Commission within the general programme for fundamental rights and justice.
The drug programme is still being discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council, in view of its adoption under the co-decision procedure.
Reports on the social cost of drug use
In June 2006, the European Commission issued a Green Paper on the role of civil society in drugs policy in the European Union (6), as laid down in the drugs action plan.
The aim of the Green Paper is to explore how best to organise a continuous dialogue with civil society organisations active in the drugs field.
Stakeholders were invited to comment on two options for a structured dialogue: a civil society forum on drugs as a platform for regular informal consultations or a thematic linking of existing networks.
Data on the social cost of drug use are reported by only a small number of countries.
In Finland (data from 2004), the indirect cost related to the use of drugs, including misuse of pharmaceuticals, was calculated to be in the region of EUR 400 to 800 million, of which EUR 306 to 701 million was attributed to the cost of life lost due to premature death while production losses amounted to EUR 61 to 102 million.
The social cost of illicit drug use was estimated at EUR 907 million in France in 2003 and at EUR 29.7 million in Luxembourg in 2004.
The involvement of civil society in drug policy in the EU is also one of the main objectives of the specific programme
Supply reduction been operational at Schiphol airport. Since the beginning of 2005, there has been 100 % control of all flights from key countries in the Caribbean.
In 2004, an average 290 drug couriers per month were arrested, decreasing to 80 per month by early 2006.
In France, a law enacted in October 2005 strengthens cooperation with the Caribbean region, with the aim of intercepting illicit drug trafficking by air and sea.
In the past year, Member States have made numerous legislative changes in the field of demand reduction, but 2006 also saw a number of countries undertake measures to improve the legal frameworks that address drug trafficking and issues related to supply reduction.
Drug testing regulation
In Ireland, substantive changes included the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which sets out new offences of supplying drugs to prisoners, provisions to deal with antisocial behaviour and proposals to strengthen imposition of the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking drugs with a street value of EUR 13 000 or more.
Membership or facilitation of a ‘criminal organisation’ (as defined in the law) is penalised, and a drug offenders register has been established, which requires those convicted of drug trafficking to inform the police of their address upon their release from prison.
Procedural changes, by contrast, were introduced in Hungary, where the national police headquarters’ provision aimed to codify all police activities related to drugs and precursors in one single, comprehensive law, to help fight drug-related crime.
Random roadside checks on drivers, using on-site rapid testing devices, are now allowed for in Lithuania, according to the resolution approving the national programme on safe road traffic 2005–10, and in Luxembourg under a draft law of 2004 modifying the law on traffic control.
In Latvia, the amended criminal law now penalises drivers believed to be operating a vehicle while intoxicated and who refuse to take a test, with the option of imposing a prison sentence in the event of repeated refusal within a year.
Also in Latvia, the modified law ‘on police’ now states that a person may be transferred to a medical establishment to determine whether he or she has used alcohol or narcotic, psychotropic or toxic substances, and refers to the cabinet regulations that detail the procedure.
Procedures regarding the drug testing of drivers are further described in the 2007 selected issue on drugs and driving.
This is stated to be in the interest of good order, safety, health and security, and would be carried out on samples of urine, oral fluids and/or hair.
Procedures regarding the use of certain tools to combat drug trafficking were also established or improved.
In Estonia, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and Associated Acts was amended in May 2005 to widen the scope of surveillance.
In Romania, a law implemented in June 2006 introduced the European arrest warrant and set out procedures for its use, as well as measures to improve judicial cooperation, surveillance and cross-border pursuit and transfer of legal procedures.
In Bulgaria, the new Penal Procedure Code introduced in October 2005 regulates controlled delivery, confidential transactions and undercover investigations.
There are also provisions for the temporary protection of witnesses in drugs cases and, in some circumstances, for protecting the identity of witnesses, as well as special rules for the questioning of such witnesses and use of undercover officers.
The Law for the Protection of Witnesses has also been widely applied in drugs cases in Cyprus.
The recent increase in cocaine trafficking has focused attention on the Caribbean area. In the Netherlands, since early 2003, a special law court with prison facilities has
In Norway, it is no longer the case that drug testing in the workplace can be carried out provided an employee or job applicant gives consent.
Since section 94 of the Working Environment Act 2005 came into force, an employer can require an employee or job applicant to undergo a drugs test only in the circumstances set out in statutes and regulations, or if performing the job while intoxicated carries particularly high risks, or if the employer deems that testing is necessary to protect the life and health of employees or a third party.
The new Finnish government decree on drug testing at work lays down a comprehensive list of provisions addressing consent, as well as the quality requirements of the test laboratories, samples and test results.

Drug-related crime
The balance between offences related to use and those related to trafficking varies, with most European countries reporting that the majority of offences are related to drug use or possession for use, figures in 2005 ranging up to 91 %
The need to prevent drug-related crime is high on the European policy agenda, as illustrated by the fact that the current EU drug strategy identifies this objective as a key area of action for achieving its aim of ensuring a high level of security for the general public.
the Netherlands, Turkey and Norway, drug law offences related to dealing and trafficking are predominant, with these offences accounting for up to 92 % (the Czech Republic) of all drug law offences reported in 2005.
In most European countries, cannabis is the illicit drug most often involved in reported drug law offences (11). In the countries where this is the case, cannabis-related offences in 2005 accounted for 42–74% of all drug law offences.
In the Czech Republic, methamphetamine-related offences predominated, accounting for 53 % of all drug law offences, while in Luxembourg cocaine was the most reported substance (implicated in 35 % of drug law offences).
Among the tasks scheduled for 2007 in the EU drug action plan 2005–08 is the adoption of a common definition of ‘drug-related crime’, on the basis of a European Commission proposal based on studies brought forward by the EMCDDA.
What is meant by ‘drug-related crime’ varies across disciplines and professionals, but it can be considered to include four broad categories: psychopharmacological crimes (those committed under the influence of a psychoactive substance), economic compulsive crimes (those committed in order to obtain money/goods/drugs to support a drug habit), systemic crimes (those committed within the functioning of illicit drug markets) and drug law offences (including use, possession, dealing, trafficking, etc.) (see also EMCDDA, 2007a).
In the five-year period 2000–05, the number of ‘reports’ of drug law offences involving cannabis remained stable or increased in the majority of reporting countries, resulting in an overall average increase of 36 % at EU level (Figure 1).
In all reporting countries except Luxembourg and the Netherlands, cannabis is the drug most often involved in offences for use/possession for use.
However, the proportion of use-related offences involving cannabis has been decreasing since 2000 in several countries (Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Austria, Slovenia and Turkey) and in the most recent year for which data are available (2004–05) in a majority of reporting countries, possibly indicating that in these countries
Definitions of the first three of these aspects of drug-related crime are sometimes difficult to apply in practice, and data are rare and patchy.
Data on ‘reports’ (8) of drug law offences are routinely available in all the European countries analysed in this report.
However, these data also reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced as well as differences in priorities set and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences.
In addition, there are variations between national information systems
The term ‘reports’ for drug law offences is given in quotation marks because it describes different concepts in different countries (police reports of suspected drug law offenders, charges for drug law offences, etc.).
For an exact definition for each country, refer to the methodological notes on drug law offences in the 2007 statistical bulletin.

NB: The trends represent the available information on national number of reports for drug law offences (criminal and non-criminal) reported by all law enforcement agencies in the EU Member States; all series are indexed to a base of 100 in 2000 and weighted by country population sizes to form an overall EU trend.
Because definitions and study units differ widely between countries, the general term ‘reports for drug law offences’ is used; for more information, see ‘Drug law offences: methods and definitions’ in the 2007 statistical bulletin.
Countries lacking data for two or more consecutive years are not included in the trend calculations: the overall trend is based on 24 countries; the trend for heroin is based on 14 countries, cocaine on 14, and cannabis on 15.

Drug-related research in Europe, as reported by national focal points, is financed through national and European public funds.
Several Member States report that research on drugs is financed by general national research funds (Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, the United Kingdom), Ministry of Health research funds (Italy) or by funds controlled by the national drug coordinating body (France, Sweden).
In Romania, research is funded through international organisations, such as the Global Fund.
Research activity of hepatitis C-positive drug users, is quoted particularly often in the German report, whereas the Dutch report focuses on new treatment methodologies.
Research studies quoted from the United Kingdom deal mainly with problem drug use, crime and market issues.
The few references to neuroscientific research are primarily Dutch; however, the French MILDT has also financed a series of research projects in this area.
Taking peer-reviewed scientific publications as an indicator of scientific activity, an analysis of such publications during 2005 and 2006 and quoted in the national reports reveals a pattern of thematic research priorities that varies between countries.
Addiction treatment appears to be an important subject of research, with the majority of studies examining different aspects of substitution treatment. Research on prevention accounts for a much smaller proportion of the scientific literature cited in the national reports.
Of the EMCDDA’s five key indicators, publications on infectious diseases are the most numerous, followed by publications on the prevalence of drug use among young people.
Treatment research, particularly treatment
) In some of the countries where the proportion of use-related offences involving cannabis has been decreasing, it is worth noting that absolute numbers of use-related offences involving cannabis are on the increase.) The fact that the European average does not reflect the increase in heroin offences found in half of the reporting countries is mainly because countries for which data are missing for two consecutive years are not included in the European average but also because the European average takes into account national population sizes (thus giving more weight to figures from some countries than to others).
EU research
Drugs and driving — EMCDDA 2007 selected issue
Psychoactive substances can impair a person’s ability to drive a car to the extent that the risk of accidents and injuries is increased.
A selected issue on drugs and driving gives an overview on the outcomes of different types of studies on this topic, focusing on cannabis and benzodiazepines, as well as on preventive and legal approaches towards this problem behaviour.
This selected issue is available in print and on the Internet in English only (http://issues07.emcdda.europa.eu).
EU funding for drug-related research is provided through research framework programmes, the most recent of which, the seventh framework programme (2007–13), was launched at the end of 2006.
Research projects reporting on their results in 2005/06 emerged from the ‘Life quality’ theme in the fifth EU research framework programme (1998–2002).
Among these are ‘quasi-compulsory treatment of drug dependent offenders in Europe’ (QCT), ‘Support needs for cocaine and crack users in Europe’ (Cocineu) and ‘integrated services aimed at dual diagnosis and optimal recovery from addiction’ (Isadora).
The EU drugs action plan 2005–08 specifically calls on Member States to increase the provision of effective and diversified methods of prevention, treatment, harm reduction and social reintegration that are easily accessible.
These facets of the drug problem in Europe will be discussed in more detail in this chapter.
Germany, the Netherlands and Norway have extended information coverage.
Greece, Cyprus, Lithuania and Italy monitor school-based prevention, while in Greece, Poland, Sweden and Finland, community-based prevention services are under study, and France has set up a centralised system to monitor drug prevention.
Some countries (the Czech Republic, the autonomous region of Galicia in Spain, Hungary and Norway) are already focusing on the evidence base when funding for interventions is applied for, and are considering introducing accreditation systems.
Portugal, Finland and Romania have minimum quality criteria for prevention programmes.
Information from Hungary and the Netherlands would suggest that the existence of prevention monitoring systems and quality criteria leads to better reporting on projects and evaluations and a higher quality of interventions.
Most prevention programmes are not evaluated.
Those that are evaluated are usually assessed in terms of the ‘scope and the acceptance of the intervention’ rather than ‘the extent to which the objectives have been achieved’ (Greek national report).
Prevention strategies can be targeted at different groups — ranging from total populations to specific risk groups — and the methods applied vary accordingly.
Treatment and harm-reduction measures are also available to drug users and drug addicts, and in a considerable number of countries their effectiveness has been evaluated through outcome studies.
Harm-reduction measures aim to prevent drug-related deaths and to reduce health-related harm, for example HIV or hepatitis C infections.
Heroin dependence is usually treated with substitution therapy, and special programmes have been developed for cannabis, amphetamine and cocaine dependence.
And, in the event of successful treatment, the next step is social reintegration.
As will be described below, the living conditions of many drug users are poor and social reintegration strategies often have to overcome considerable problems.
For each type of intervention, examples are given from different countries and research results in support of their effectiveness, or otherwise, are discussed.
In the past few years, reviews on the effectiveness of prevention have been carried out in Germany (Bühler and Kröger, 2006) and the United Kingdom (Canning et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2006), and by the World Health Organisation (WHO) (Hawks et al., 2002).
These are helpful in defining good practice in prevention strategies.
The most recent and comprehensive study (Bühler and Kröger, 2006) evaluated 49 high-quality overviews, such as reviews and meta-analyses, on the prevention of substance abuse and drew conclusions regarding efficient strategies of drug prevention.
In the sections below, the effectiveness of different types of prevention strategy is discussed, based on the results of this study and others.
The effects of individual prevention strategies cannot, in general, be measured by changes in population-level prevalences of drug use.
However, every prevention strategy can be compared against the accumulated body of evidence, to determine whether or not it is an evidence-based intervention.
This requires good information on the content, coverage and number of prevention interventions.
Mass media campaigns
Improving the available information: monitoring, quality control and evaluation
Member States are increasingly monitoring prevention interventions and, as a result, are delivering data on the
Evidence-based practice primarily concerned with the impact of the intervention on health or other relevant outcomes as a means to establish evidence for what works.
Evidence-based practices are interventions (e.g. drug treatment) that have been consistently proven, based on scientific investigations (e.g. research studies), to result in preferred client outcomes (e.g. reduction in drug use).
Criteria commonly used to determine whether an intervention can be considered an evidence-based practice are efficacy and effectiveness (Brown et al., 2000; Flay et al., 2005).
The process of establishing evidence is, however, complicated by the fact that there are divergent views on how to judge the quality of the research studies investigating efficacy or effectiveness and on which type of research method (e.g. quantitative or qualitative) is the most appropriate to establish evidence of what works.
As a consequence, conclusions about what works can differ.
It remains a challenge to determine how to evaluate and weigh the different sources of evidence in the decision-making process.
This will be even more difficult in the case of interventions for which a comprehensive evidence base has not yet been established but the experience of which would suggest may be effective.
Despite these difficulties, the guiding assumption remains that evidence can help to improve healthcare practice and policy, and that discussion of evidence-based practices needs to be fostered, accompanied by clear criteria for evaluating evidence.
Efficacy is a measure of how well an intervention works under ideal research conditions.
Efficacy is ideally determined by carrying out a controlled trial, in which some participants receive the intervention under test while a control group receives another intervention or no intervention, or, better still, in a randomised controlled trial, in which participants are randomly allocated to receive one of the two interventions (Cochrane Collaboration, 2007).
It is generally believed that only randomised controlled trials or controlled trials, preferably combined with process evaluation, can establish the efficacy of an intervention and so provide a basis for future practice and policy.
Unfortunately, however, the random allocation of participants to either an intervention or control group is not always feasible.
Effectiveness is a measure of how well an intervention works in ordinary circumstances.
Frequently, interventions that have shown promise in controlled trials are implemented in the community to investigate how well they work under routine conditions.
To contribute to this exchange and further the dissemination of evidence-based practices, the EMCDDA is developing an online portal that will provide an overview of the latest available evidence regarding the effectiveness of different interventions as well as tools available to improve the quality of interventions and concrete best-practice examples implemented in Member States of the EU. The Cochrane Collaboration will be an important source of information to the portal.
mass media campaigns) to the provision of social–emotional information (trying to change perceptions about, for example, cannabis use).
For example, in the Netherlands a campaign put across the message ‘You are not mad if you are not smoking cannabis, because 80 % of all young people
14 do not smoke either’ (
It has, however, been found to raise information levels and to lend support to policy initiatives’.
However, other evidence suggests that mass media campaigns can have positive effects if used as a supporting measure to reinforce other strategies (Bühler and Kröger, 2006).
national drug prevention campaign in Ireland seek to dispel some of the myths that surround cannabis, such as claims that it is ‘organic’ and ‘natural’.
Environmental strategies on licit substances
In an evaluation of Scotland’s ‘Know the score’ cocaine campaign, Binnie et al.
(2006) found that 30 % of users were less likely to take cocaine after seeing advertisements, although 56 % reported that the campaign did not alter their intentions to use cocaine and 11 % claimed that they were more likely to use.
In addition, the recent re-evaluation of the US government’s cannabis campaign confirmed previous findings that while the campaign (despite positive recall rates and differentiation by target groups) had no effect on the attitudes of young non-users towards cannabis use, exposure to the campaign was associated with unfavourable effects on youths’ perceptions of others’ use of marijuana (GAO, 2006).
In a few isolated cases, however, there has been a shift in emphasis from knowledge enhancement (the aim of most
Increasing the price of a substance and/or the legal age limit for its consumption have been shown to have a positive effect in reducing use, but are available only in the case of licit substances such as alcohol and tobacco (Bühler and Kröger, 2006).
Such environmental strategies have until now been something of a Nordic or US phenomenon, focusing predominantly on alcohol, and with promising results (Lohrmann et al., 2005; Stafström et al., 2006).
Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland,

16), despite evidence which suggests that other visits) ( methods may be more effective.
Social influence programmes in schools are widespread, particularly in the United Kingdom and in countries offering standardised programmes, such as Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Norway and, soon, Denmark.
Such strategies are aimed at reducing consumption among young people, creating alcohol-free zones or increasing security in nightlife settings.
As far as schools are concerned, recent studies from Europe (Kuntsche and Jordan, 2006) and elsewhere (Aveyard et al., 2004) confirm that the normative climate and informal networks strongly influence consumption behaviour of legal drugs and cannabis.
The introduction of school norms is now receiving greater consideration in Germany, Ireland and Italy (15).
Universal prevention
As regards universal community-based prevention, 12 Member States report that drug plans are available in most or all municipalities, and in 10 countries they are a political priority.
Such schemes principally take the form of information events and, to a lesser extent, the provision of alternative leisure-time pursuits.
Universal family-based prevention mostly consists of parents’ evenings or information approaches, and infrequently in intensive training for parents.
Member States are increasingly devoting attention to prevention strategies targeted at entire vulnerable
be identified, for example using standardised assessment tools, such as the United Kingdom’s Index of Multiple Deprivation, or by socio-economic indicators, such as standards of accommodation or education (number of pupils behind in their schooling or number of subsidised pupils).
Some commentators have suggested that complementary general health/life skills programmes produce greater change than skills-based education programmes alone, suggesting that interventions are best integrated within a well-founded health curriculum (Hawks et al., 2002).
This seems to have been achieved in almost all Member States.
Furthermore, several Member States (e.g. Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, the United Kingdom) address drugs prevention together with health and social aspects such as violence, mental health problems, social exclusion, academic underachievement and tobacco and alcohol use under the umbrella of public health prevention, which also gives greater focus on responding specifically to the needs of vulnerable groups.
Once target communities have been identified (e.g. France recognises ‘sensitive urban zones’ or, in the case of schools, ‘educational priority zones’), supplementary funds can be directed towards these underprivileged groups.
In Ireland, Cyprus and the United Kingdom, selective prevention projects are already delivered to most of these areas, and Portugal is in the process of implementing such a strategy.
Types of provision range from counselling services in Estonia, Greece, France and Slovakia to outreach projects in Luxembourg and Austria, sometimes aimed specifically at ethnic groups.
Furthermore, some new Member States (Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Romania) report much on interventions aimed at vulnerable families.
The focus in most Member States is on substance use in the family, although a few countries (Greece, Lithuania, Hungary, the United Kingdom) have adopted a broader focus aimed at all socially disadvantaged families.
A reason frequently given for not implementing model programmes is that they would not be adaptable to local conditions and would not address individual communities’ needs (Ives, 2006).
However, a counter argument is that the advantages of standardised prevention programmes are that protocols provide clear guidelines to enable stable delivery infrastructures and teacher training systems to be created; and this facilitates common implementation standards, even where schools and community conditions are very disparate.
In many Member States (Bulgaria, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Austria, Romania) the content of prevention
While also used in universal prevention, peer-based approaches are increasingly being reported for the delivery of selective prevention (Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland and Norway).
) See also http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/?nnodeid=19197) Data from SQ 22 and 25.) For more information on selective prevention, especially risk groups and factors, see previous annual reports and the 2007 selected issue on drug use among minors.
Characteristics of drug users attending outpatient treatment
Data from the treatment demand indicator can be used to characterise the socio-economic status of patients attending treatment centres and, to some extent, all drug users (18).
It seems that such approaches may be more effective at changing knowledge and attitudes than in changing behaviour.
Peer projects are rarely evaluated at all, but when they are (e.g. Free Style in Norway) they typically assess only success in recruiting young leaders in schools and whether the peer leaders’ knowledge or attitudes were strengthened.
access to outpatient treatment is easier and less selective in most countries, it is appropriate to extrapolate from this group of clients to drug users as a whole.
Although selective prevention is gaining in popularity, caution is required, especially when involving young people at risk in peer-to-peer programmes (Cho et al., 2005; Dishion and Dodge, 2005), because negative ‘contagion effects’ can occur among vulnerable groups.
These unintended effects, which are caused by the intervention itself, can lead to increased substance use or risk behaviour.
However, such undesirable outcomes are not unique to selective prevention but are also observed in the case of mass media information provision as well as individual prevention events (see above).
In 2005, 20 out of 29 European countries reported information on 315 000 drug clients attending outpatient treatment centres. The data came from about 4 000 treatment units.
Approximately half (53 %) of the outpatient clients are treated for primary opioid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs, in particular cannabis (22 %) and cocaine (16 %).
The drug that is most commonly the primary drug of consumption varies between countries.
Treatment and harm-reduction responses
Recent developments in treatment systems
Most treatment of drug users takes place in outpatient settings, including general practice.
The enlargement of outpatient treatment networks has continued in recent years, and a further geographical expansion took place in several countries, including Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Lithuania, Romania and Finland; in contrast, the number of inpatient facilities has remained stable in most countries.
About 80 % of outpatient treatment clients are male, with a mean age of around 30 years (28 years among those new to treatment), and their living conditions are generally poor compared with the general population of the same age.
Around 60 % of outpatient clients have not achieved a level of education beyond primary, and about one tenth of those clients have not even completed primary education.
Around half of the clients were in regular employment before entering outpatient treatment and the other half were unemployed; most outpatient clients are in stable accommodation (85 %), of whom 40 % live with their parents and 19 % live alone.
A significant minority of drug outpatient clients (15 %) live with children, either alone or with their partner, representing a complicating aspect in the drug user’s life and representing a risk factor for the children.
Countries in which national geographical coverage of specialised drug treatment facilities is very patchy include Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania.
Despite recent expansions of the network of service providers, waiting lists for substitution treatment continue to exist in Greece as well as in Hungary and Poland.
Information on the socio-economic situation of drug clients in treatment is complemented by national information from some countries broken down by main substance used.
For example, in Germany, 67 % of heroin users are unemployed or economically inactive, compared with 53 % of cocaine clients and 35 % of cannabis clients, and 74 % of opioid clients have limited school education, compared with 63 % of cocaine clients (Sonntag et al., 2006).
New developments
Specialised facilities targeting specific groups of drug users, e.g. female drug users, homeless street injectors, sex workers, or young and very young drug users (see the 2007 selected issue on drug use among minors), have been newly established in several countries. In other countries,
Treatment in residential facilities, formerly the predominant approach to the treatment of heroin use in many European countries, is relatively less common nowadays, and the majority of opioid users are treated in outpatient settings.
Residential services are, however, of growing importance in the care of elderly and long-term drug users with complex treatment needs because of the coexistence of serious somatic and psychological co-morbidity.
The philosophy of inpatient facilities and the way they work have changed considerably over the years, in response to changing needs.
The co-location of treatment and medical care, including psychiatric treatments, highly active antiretroviral treatment and
) See the TDI tables and graphs in the 2007 statistical bulletin for more details on the figures quoted in this section.
Legal frameworks of substitution treatment pharmacological treatment options have been expanded to meet the needs of specific user groups with the aim of increasing treatment coverage.
For example, buprenorphine maintenance treatment is now licensed in Malta (19
In 2006, a survey was carried out among the specialised network of legal correspondents to obtain further information about laws and official regulations regarding admission criteria for substitution treatment as well as about prescribing and dispensing practice.
Results were obtained from 17 countries and complemented a 2003 report from the
European legal database on drugs (1).
The scope of the legal framework varies considerably between Member States.
In some countries, e.g. Belgium, substitution treatment is covered by a specific parliamentary law, while in others, e.g. Cyprus, its implementation is subject to interpretation of the laws on controlled substances.
There is a trade-off between strength of the framework and flexibility. flexibility.
Member States are increasingly acknowledging the importance of providing adequate treatment services for problematic cannabis and cocaine users.
In the case of cannabis, treatment, counselling and prevention programmes in Europe are often intertwined in order to reach a large number of users.
New communication strategies, for example making use of the Internet, are being implemented in an attempt to reach cannabis users whose drug use falls somewhere between experimental and problematic.
The substances that can be used for substitution treatment are normally designated by law.
In most cases, only methadone and buprenorphine or only methadone can be prescribed, although in a few countries other drugs such as morphine or codeine are permitted.
Similarly, in almost all countries national admission criteria are laid down either in laws or in ministerial decrees or guidelines.
The most common criteria are diagnosis of addiction and minimum age, although the need for previous unsuccessful drug-free treatment also features.
In some countries, sanctions for violating treatment rules are set out in national laws while in others the issue is at the discretion of each individual treatment centre.
Moreover, Member States facing a high level of demand for cocaine treatment are starting to commission research in this field, the issue being complicated by the fact that users of powder cocaine and crack cocaine are usually members of quite distinct social groups (see Chapter 5).
At present, however, because of the current lack of specific services, the large majority of psychostimulant users, including amphetamine users, are being treated within traditional, opioid-orientated treatment services, with an identified training need for treatment staff and clinicians across Europe.
Treatment of heroin dependence
After political endorsement as a response to heroin use in the second half of the 1980s, substitution treatment has gone on to become the predominant option for the treatment of opioid dependence in most countries (Figure 2).
The laws usually also define who is permitted to prescribe.
This is primarily doctors in treatment centres, though in some countries any doctor or certain trained or accredited doctors may prescribe.
In practice, it is rare for doctors outside treatment centres to initiate substitution treatment (2).
Maximum doses are rarely defined in law.
To prevent duplicate prescriptions, most countries use special prescription forms, though a central register is found in several countries and a few issue special ID cards.
Authorised dispensaries are usually also specified in the legislation, mostly pharmacies or treatment centres, though some countries also allow doctors to dispense.
Finally, in most countries, a system for taking doses home has been established by law, guidelines or simply tolerance, but occasionally this is specifically forbidden.
Further details are available at http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/?nnodeid=5036See Table HSR-6 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.
21 or higher levels of supervision and monitoring introduced (
The main substitution drugs used are methadone and buprenorphine.
Ideally, pharmacological treatment should be combined with psychological counselling and social support.
Substitution treatment is usually delivered in outpatient settings at specialised drug treatment units but increasingly also by doctors in private practice.
In some countries, e.g. Germany, France and the United Kingdom, general practitioners are heavily involved in treating drug users.
In others, the level of involvement of community-based medical doctors is still limited, either for legal reasons or because of a lack of interest in addiction treatment (20).
Quality control has also been on the agenda in several countries, resulting in regulations being tightened, training requirements increased
The treatment of opioid addiction is explored in more detail in Chapter 6.

Figure 2: Estimated availability of opioid substitution treatment in the EU-15 Member States, 1993–2005 harm-reduction services.
It appears to be particularly influential among the countries that joined the EU in 2004.
Social reintegration
Precarious housing, irregular employment and a history of imprisonment are indicators of social exclusion that characterise the life of numerous drug users.
In many European countries the number of problem drug users being reached, retained in treatment and undergoing drug substitution treatment is greater than ever, with the result that demand for housing, education, employment and legal assistance has significantly increased.
Care systems are therefore challenged to find novel responses to new client profiles, often characterised by multiple needs.
Social reintegration is now established as an important determinant of long-term treatment success.

Harm-reduction responses
Prevention of infectious diseases and a reduction in drug-related deaths are central targets of the EU response to drugs, and the current action plan sets the objective of increasing the availability and accessibility of services and facilities to prevent and reduce health-related harm.
In some countries, the reintegration sector is receiving increasing political attention and investment, and in several countries standards for drug maintenance treatment envisage that social care and reintegration services should be made available to clients.
For example, the mid-term review of the Irish drugs strategy recommended the inclusion of rehabilitation as the fifth pillar of the strategy, while in Denmark new programmes for vulnerable groups (‘shared responsibility’) were launched by the Ministries of Employment and of Social Affairs.
Another example is the Norwegian government’s strategy for preventing and combating homelessness, which sets measurable targets, such as reducing evictions and increasing access to permanent housing so that temporary accommodation becomes the exception.
Also in Norway, an action plan to combat poverty includes a grant scheme that in 2006 distributed EUR 6.5 million for the provision of residential follow-up services for homeless people and alcohol and drug users.
In addition, Greece, France, Italy, Lithuania, Austria, Portugal and Slovakia participate in the Commission’s EQUAL initiative in the area of employment and social inclusion (24).
The EU also encouraged the creation of a framework called ‘Open method of coordination’ (OMC), in which Member States coordinate their policies for combating poverty and social exclusion through a process of policy exchanges and mutual learning.
This report documents that harm reduction is a defined public health objective at national level in all Member States.
The background document commissioned to support the report of the Commission provides a comprehensive European picture of harm-reduction policies and interventions.
It is based on information provided mainly by policymakers, Reitox experts and grass-root organisations.
Extensive country-by-country inventories are included in this background document (23).

National treatment outcome studies
Three Member States (Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom) have conducted national treatment outcome studies aimed at investigating treatment outcome by following a cohort of problem drug users over time in different treatment modalities and settings.
An important feature of the studies is that they investigate treatment outcomes in existing services under day-to-day clinical circumstances.
Common treatment modalities examined include methadone maintenance, methadone reduction, detoxification and drug-free interventions such as therapeutic communities and counselling.
Drug use, physical and psychological health, retention in treatment and criminal behaviour are the main outcome variables used.
Programmes and actions in many countries are not specifically aimed at drug users but address vulnerable social groups in general and are typically implemented at local or regional level.
Thus, the ‘plans de prévention de proximité’ (PPP) established by the Walloon government in 2003 address locally poverty and addiction as two intertwined issues, while in Denmark, the Social Services Act obliges municipalities to offer a social action plan to all drug users.
Similarly, local governments in Poland have a legal obligation to socially reintegrate drug users, and in the Netherlands most new social reintegration services are initiated by municipalities.
Finally, in Germany, shelter, schooling and housing are taken care of at the Länder level or by municipalities, while federal programmes for people with disabilities are available to support the vocational integration of drug users.
In Italy, the Vedette study (1998–2001) aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment offered in public treatment centres across the country.
Retention in treatment and mortality among heroin users were the main outcome variables.
To date, three treatment outcome studies have been instituted in the United Kingdom.
The first was the National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS), carried out by the National Addiction Centre in England and Wales between 1995 and 2000.
It investigated treatment outcomes in residential or community treatment programmes.
There were some positive findings, such as increased rates of abstinence from illicit drug use, a reduction in the frequency of drug use, a reduction in crime and improved health.
However, some longer-term outcomes over the five-year period were less satisfactory, for example early improvement in the use of crack was partly reversed after four to five years and many drug users continued to drink heavily (Gossop et al., 2001).
Housing assistance ranges from emergency day shelters, hostels and short-term residential facilities to half-way flats, assisted accommodation and rent subsidies.
To avoid ‘locking’ clients into longer-term service dependence, innovative approaches in the area of supported housing or financial management are being explored.
For example, in Denmark, clients in reintegration flats are offered accommodation training to reduce possible future problems when they have to manage their own flats, and in the United Kingdom clients receive advice about shopping, cooking and the management of the household budget.
An update of the NTORS study will be provided by the Drug Treatment Outcomes Research Study (DTORS) being carried out at the University of Manchester.
The study started in 2006 and will follow drug users from across England for an initial 12 months.
It aims to evaluate the impact of drug treatment on a range of outcome measures and focuses on the analysis of which types of treatment pathways produce the best outcomes for particular subgroups of drug users.
In Scotland, the Drug Outcome Research Study (DORIS), being carried out by the University of Glasgow, started in 2001.
This study examines the impact and effectiveness of drug treatment services based at treatment agencies, including prison-based services.
Drug users were followed up for up to 33 months.
In Ireland, the Research Outcome Study (ROSIE) conducted by the National University of Ireland, Maynooth commenced in 2003 and evaluates drug treatment effectiveness through follow-up of opioid users entering treatment over a period of up to three years, documenting the changes observed (Cox et al., 2006).
At one-year follow-up, the study found marked reductions in drug use and criminal activity, a low mortality rate and some positive outcomes in terms of participants’ physical and mental health complaints.
While the creation of new opportunities for training and access to education is reported as common in many countries, paid work is harder to obtain for these groups.
However, it is of particular importance for the target group as it provides not only economic stability but also self-esteem, status and a regular rhythm of life.
New ways of getting clients into paid work include forming partnerships with private enterprises, mentoring schemes and providing incentives such as subsidising trainees’ wages or giving business start-up loans.
In several countries, drug treatment facilities have started their own socio-economic enterprises, gainfully employing their clients.
Other initiatives focus on improving the employment situation through better matching of profiles, expectations and skills with the realities of work life.
For example, the Vienna Job Exchange acts as an intermediary between clients, drugs agencies and the public employment services, carrying out specific counselling to increase success rates on the job.
It also helps to identify solutions for clients for whom occupational reintegration is no longer an option.
However, a large centralised residential facility to accommodate 120 homeless drug users with psychiatric problems met with local objections.
For those with mental health problems, professional help to re-establish a network of support and contact persons is identified as an important component of the social reintegration process.
The reintegration of marginalised, ageing heroin users with high levels of somatic and mental illness poses a particular challenge.
In Belgium, drug users with psychiatric problems may be cared for in specialised substance abuse units at psychiatric or general hospitals, or in other psychiatric care facilities; Denmark reports that drug users with psychiatric problems are taken care of in psychiatric care facilities and that alternative care homes accommodate elderly drug users who cannot manage alone because of drug use, dementia or problem behaviour.
In the Netherlands, a new Social Support Act was adopted in 2007, including drug addiction under the same regulations as (other) chronic psychiatric
In some countries (e.g. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Slovenia), structured reintegration programmes are provided only as a follow-on from successfully completed abstinence-based drug dependence treatment, and specific reintegration measures for clients in drug maintenance treatment are currently not available.
Interpreting seizures and other market data
Introduction: the changing picture of cannabis use in Europe
Drug seizures in a country are usually considered an indirect indicator of the supply and availability of drugs, although they also reflect law enforcement resources, priorities and strategies, as well as the vulnerability of traffickers to national and international supply reduction activities, and reporting practices.
Quantities seized may fluctuate widely from one year to the next, for example if in one year a few of the seizures are very large.
In all countries, the number of seizures includes a major proportion of small seizures at the retail (street) level.
Where known, origin and destination of drugs seized may indicate trafficking routes and producing areas.
The price and purity/potency of drugs at retail level are reported by most of the Member States.
However, data come from a range of different sources, which are not always comparable, making accurate comparisons between countries difficult. cult.
Cannabis is the world’s most commonly used illicit drug and a substance that has been at the centre of the drugs debate in Europe since the 1960s when its use became virtually synonymous with a growing youth counterculture.
Despite this familiarity, understanding the patterns of cannabis use in Europe is a complicated task.
One important element in this picture is the different cannabis products now available on the European market. Historically, three main forms of cannabis have been common in Europe: cannabis resin; herbal cannabis; and, far less frequently, cannabis oil.
For many, the smoking of cannabis resin with tobacco remains the usual route of administration for the drug, though, elsewhere in the world, this pattern of use is relatively uncommon.
While Europe remains the dominant global market for cannabis resin, herbal cannabis products appear to be becoming more common and predominate in some markets.
In recent years, this picture has grown more complicated still with the increasing availability of cannabis produced within Europe; some of which is grown under controlled conditions and can be of relatively high potency.
This kind of cannabis has become a specific product in its own right in many countries and complicates the assessment of the public health impact of changing patterns of cannabis consumption.
Supply and availability
In order to view European drug seizures in a wider context, in this report summary information is presented on the global situation.
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime produce an annual report on the international drug situation and this is the principal source used for the world estimates included here.
The reader should note that there are difficulties in compiling information of this sort and, in many parts of the world, information systems are poorly developed.
Therefore, these data should be viewed as the best approximations possible from the information resources currently available.
Because cannabis can be grown in a range of different environments and grows wild in many parts of the world, it is extremely difficult to produce convincing estimates of global production.
Following an upward trend over several years, taking into account information on the diversification of cannabis production, the UNODC has reduced its global estimates of herbal cannabis production from 45 000 tonnes in 2004 to 42 000 tonnes in 2005, mainly due to falling production estimates from North America following intensified cannabis eradication efforts.
It is now estimated that about half of all cannabis is grown
Morocco remains the main international producer of cannabis resin, and although recent survey work suggests that the area under cannabis cultivation decreased by around 40 % between 2004 and 2005, it is still estimated that the country produces some 70 % of the cannabis resin consumed in Europe.
Based on estimates of the total area under cultivation, Morocco had a potential production of 1 066 tonnes in 2005, with most Moroccan cannabis bound for the European and North African markets (CND, 2007;
Despite the different legal approaches towards cannabis across the Member States (1), a general trend in Europe can be seen in the development of alternative measures to criminal conviction, for cases of use and possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use without aggravating circumstances.
Cannabis is now frequently distinguished from other illicit substances either in the law, by prosecutorial directive, or by the judiciary practice.
In most European countries, the move has been away from custodial sentences and towards fines, cautions, probation, exemption from punishment and counselling.
Examples of this trend can be found in a number of recent measures, including the removal of custodial penalties in Luxembourg in 2001 and Belgium in 2003, and reduction of custodial penalties in Greece in 2003 and the United Kingdom in 2004.
Directives to police or prosecutors were issued in: Belgium in 2003 and 2005, France in 2005, and the United Kingdom in 2004 and 2006.
In 2006, the Czech Republic almost established different classes for non-medicinal drugs, but that draft of the Penal Code was rejected for unrelated reasons.
If cannabis resin in Europe tends to be a fairly uniform product, the same cannot be said of herbal cannabis.
The origin of seizures reported in 2005 includes Albania, the Netherlands, countries of the former Yugoslavia, Angola and South Africa.
Although domestic production of herbal cannabis is difficult to monitor systematically, in 2005, it was noted in half of the reporting countries.
Some cannabis produced in Europe is grown outdoors and can be considered virtually indistinguishable from imported herbal cannabis.
However, relatively high-potency cannabis grown under intensive conditions seems to be becoming an important and possibly growing part of the market in many countries and equipment that allows users to produce cannabis at home is now widely available through the Internet or, in some countries, from specialist suppliers.
The fact that this form of the drug is grown inside and often in close proximity to the intended market may mean that it is less commonly intercepted and, therefore, less visible in the available data.
In 2005, global seizures of cannabis resin totalled 1 302 tonnes as compared to 4 644 tonnes of herbal cannabis; both totals were down on the 2004 figures.
Western and central Europe continued to account for the bulk of resin seized (70 %), while quantities of herbal cannabis seized remained concentrated in North America (64 %) (UNODC, 2007).
An estimated 303 000 seizures of cannabis resin amounting to 909 tonnes were made in Europe in 2005 (25
The cannabis debate remains contentious and considerable disagreement remains over the relative costs and benefits of different public health and criminal justice responses.
This is reflected in the fact that not all measures have gone in the direction of easing penalties and, in some countries, penalties have been made more severe or the current situation is under critical review.
In 2004, a directive to prosecutors in Denmark called for fines to be issued instead of warnings and in Italy, in 2006, the legal distinction between non-medicinal drugs was removed, discouraging the notion of a distinction between ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ drugs.
Other countries have been reviewing their current response to cannabis; for example the Netherlands published a specific cannabis strategy in 2005 and Germany carried out an evaluation of the implementation of penalties for simple cannabis possession.
However, this was not true for the quantity of resin intercepted, which fell in 2005, after increasing in the period 2000–04.
Cannabis policy remains an issue that generates considerable public discussion and disagreement.
This can be seen in the findings of the recent Eurobarometer survey (2006), which asked European citizens if they agreed with the statement that personal consumption of cannabis should be legalised throughout Europe.
Just over two thirds (68 %) of those asked disagreed and around a quarter (26 %) agreed with this proposition.
In all countries, although the proportion of those sampled that favoured continued prohibition varied, it was always the majority view.
For a fuller discussion see the ELDD topic overview: http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/?nnodeid=5036
The relative position of resin and herbal cannabis can be seen by the fact that in 2005 there were only about half as many herbal cannabis seizures (152 000) and less than one tenth of the volume seized (66 tonnes).
The numbers of herbal cannabis seizures in Europe have steadily increased over the last five years, although the picture for quantities seized appears less clear, with a possible increase in 2005
) The data on European drug seizures that this section is based on can be found in Tables SZR-1, SZR-2, SZR-3 and SZR-4 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.)
This should be checked against missing 2005 data when available.
For estimating purposes, 2005 missing data were replaced by 2004 data.
young people increased in virtually all countries. However, some of the more recent data suggest that the upward trend is levelling off, albeit at historically high levels.
An important secondary question is to explore trends among those using the drug intensively and for long periods of time. Here, the data is less good but concern exists that more young people
Drug use in the general or school population is assessed through surveys, which provide estimates of the proportion of people that declare having used drugs over defined periods of time: lifetime, last year or last month.
In 2005, an estimated 13 500 seizures in Europe resulted in the interception of about 24 million cannabis plants (most of them in Turkey) and 13.6 tonnes of cannabis plants (most of it in Spain).
Overall, the number of seizures of cannabis plants in Europe shows a continuous upward trend since 2000.
If we look at the EU Member States, the number of cannabis plants seized peaked in 2001 and increased again since 2003, whereas in Turkey after an increase in the period 2001–03, the number of cannabis plants seized decreased in 2004 and increased again in 2005.
Price and potency
The EMCDDA, in association with national experts, has developed a set of common core items (the ‘European Model Questionnaire’, EMQ) for use in adult surveys, and this has been implemented in most EU Member States.
Details of the EMQ are included in ‘Handbook for surveys about drug use among the general population’ (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/?nnodeid=1380).
However, there are still differences between countries in methodology and year of data collection, and small differences between countries should be interpreted with caution (1).
As surveys are expensive to conduct, few countries collect information annually.
In this report, data is presented based on the most recent survey available, which in most cases will be between 2003 and 2006.
In 2005, the average retail price of both cannabis resin and herbal cannabis varied, both between and within countries, with the majority of countries reporting prices for cannabis products in the range EUR 4–10 per gram (27).
However, reported average or typical prices for both types of cannabis ranged from EUR 2 per gram to over EUR 15.
Mean prices of cannabis resin, corrected for inflation, fell over the period 2000–05 in all reporting countries except Poland, where prices remained stable.
Mean prices of herbal cannabis, corrected for inflation also decreased or remained stable over the same period in all reporting countries except Slovenia (28
Three measures of drug use over time are commonly used for reporting survey data. Lifetime use or prevalence is the broadest.
This measure is commonly used for reporting on very young groups, for example school children, but is of limited value in reflecting the current situation among adults, although it may provide insight into patterns of use and incidence.
In this report, the focus is on reporting use in the last year and in the last month, as these two measures better reflect the present situation, with the latter category often serving as a proxy measure for regular use.
Clearly, identifying those who are using regularly or having problems with their use of drugs is important, and some progress has been made in this respect with the development of scales to assess more intensive forms of use; and these are included where they are available (see the box on developing psychometric scales, p. 42).
EMCDDA standard age ranges: all adults (15 to 64 years) and young adults (15 to 34 years).
Data from some countries cover slightly different age ranges (e.g. 16–64, 18–64, 16–59 years).
For more information about methodology of population surveys and the methodology used in each national survey, see the 2007 statistical bulletin.
The more recent survey data confirm the picture of cannabis use as the most frequently used illicit substance in Europe.
During the 1990s, the use of the drug, particularly among
Data on price of both cannabis resin and herbal cannabis were analysed for 19 countries (in which data for at least three consecutive years were available).)
Data on cannabis potency can be found in Tables PPP-2 and PPP-5 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.

Denmark, France, the United Kingdom and Spain, with the highest reported levels of last year prevalence from Spain, the Czech Republic, France and Italy. On average 30 % of young adults report lifetime use and 13 % use in the last year, and over 7 % report use in the last month.
It is conservatively estimated that cannabis has been used at least once (lifetime prevalence) by more than 70 million European adults, that is on average nearly a quarter (22 %) aged 35 to 64 years, are 3 % and 1.6% respectively (34

National figures vary from
2 % to 37 %, with the lowest figures in Bulgaria, Malta and Romania, and the highest in Denmark (36.5%), France
Despite this wide overall range, 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lifetime prevalence rates in the range 10–25% (32
If attention is restricted to young people in the 15- to 24-year age range, prevalence estimates for lifetime use range between 3 % and 44 % (with most countries reporting figures in the range 20–40%).
Last-year prevalence rates range from 4 % to 28 % (in most countries 10–25%); and last month prevalence rates are between 1 % and 19 % (in most countries 5–12%).
Among males in this age group, prevalence estimates are higher still.
Lifetime use was reported by 11–51% of young males (in most countries 25–45%), use in the last year was reported by 5–35% (in most countries 15–30%), and last month use by 1.7–23.7% (in most countries 6–20%) (35).
Patterns of cannabis use
Moving the point of reference from lifetime to last year, the levels of reported cannabis use fall but still remain considerable.
Estimates suggest that more than 23 million European adults have used cannabis in the last year, producing an average figure of about 7 % of all 15- to 64-year-olds.
National figures range between 1 % and 11.2%, with the lowest figures reported by Bulgaria, Greece and Malta, and the highest by Italy (11.2%), Spain (11.2%), the Czech Republic (9.3%) and the United Kingdom (8.7%).
Again, despite the wide overall range, 13 out of the 25 countries that provided information reported last year prevalence estimates between 4 % and 9 % (Figure 3).
As noted above, the use of cannabis, as with most other illegal drugs, is notably higher among younger people, although even here considerable country variation can be found.
Use is also notably higher among males than among females, although this difference tends to be less pronounced for young people.
Estimates of last month prevalence will include people using cannabis more regularly, although not necessarily in an intensive way.
It is estimated that 13.4 million Europeans adults used the drug in the previous month, on average about 4 % of all 15- to 64-year-olds.
Country figures range between 0.5 % and 8.7%.
The lowest figures were reported by Bulgaria, Malta, Lithuania and Sweden, and the highest from Spain (8.7%), Italy (5.8%), the United Kingdom (5.2%) and France (4.8%).
Of the 26 countries that provided information, figures from 13 countries fall within the range 2 % to 6 % (33).
Cannabis use among young adults
Cannabis use is disproportionately high among young people, with, depending on the country surveyed, between 3 % and 49.5% of young European adults (15–34 years) reporting having ever used cannabis, 3–20% reporting use in the last year, and 1.5–15.5% reporting use in the last month. The highest lifetime figures are reported from
For many, cannabis use tends to be discontinued after a short experimental period and rates of use generally decline as individuals grow older.
Tracking the careers of cannabis users in the available data and identifying changes over time in consumption patterns is, however, difficult.
Some insight into this issue can be gained by comparing reported lifetime use with more recent consumption measures.
On average, this analysis suggests that 32 % of all adults (15–64 years) who have ever used cannabis have done so in the last year and 18 % in the last month.
) The average proportion was computed as the average of national prevalence rates weighted according to the population of the relevant age group in each country.
Total numbers were computed by multiplying prevalence among the population concerned in each country and, in countries for which no information was available, imputing the average prevalence.
Figures here are probably a minimum, as there could be some under-reporting.)
In this text, the United Kingdom figures are based on the 2006 British Crime Survey (England and Wales), due to practical reasons.

The EMCDDA is currently working closely with a number of Member States on the development of a better methodological approach to this issue.
A crude estimation made by EMCDDA in 2004, based on limited data, suggested that around 1 % of European adults, or about 3 million people, may be ‘daily or almost daily’ cannabis users.
It is planned that this estimation can be updated in the near future.
Another important information need in this area is to better understand the factors associated with discontinuing use.
As noted above, most of those who initiate cannabis use will discontinue it after an interval of time.
Understanding the factors associated with giving up is clearly important for the design of interventions in this area.
) There is as yet no universally accepted definition of ‘intensive cannabis use’.
It is, however, a broad term meaning use of cannabis that exceeds a certain threshold of frequency.
It does not necessarily imply the existence of ‘dependence/abuse’ or other problems, but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences, including dependence.
In this chapter, figures refer to ‘daily or almost daily use’ (defined as use on 20 or more days out of the last 30 days).
This benchmark has often been used in studies and can be derived from the European model questionnaire.
Ongoing methodological studies (national and EMCDDA) will help to understand better relationships between intensive/frequent use and problems (see box on developing psychometric scales, p. 42).
This measure (use on 30 days during last 30 days) is different from the previously used ‘daily or almost daily use’ (use 20 days or more during last 30 days), which will produce a higher estimation.
In France, a ‘regular consumer’ is defined as using the drug ‘10 times or more in the last 30 days’ (4.3% of adult males, 1.3% of adult females).
In the United Kingdom, ‘frequent use’ is considered ‘use more than once per month in the last year’, and is not comparable with measures used in this section.
Developing psychometric scales to identify intensive, dependent and problematic cannabis use in survey data there are important temporal differences between countries and waves of popularity observable in the use of the drug since it began to become popular in the 1960s (38).
An example of this is data from Sweden (2005 Reitox national report) where a relatively high level of experimentation was reported in the 1970s among conscripts and school students, followed by a substantial decrease in the 1980s, and then a new rise during the 1990s to levels similar to those of the 1970s followed by a subsequent decrease in more recent years.
A similar phenomenon is seen in the Finnish data with major drug waves, first in the 1960s and then again in the 1990s.
Descriptions on drug use from surveys are based on self-reported behaviour over different time intervals.
Historically, daily use has not been monitored systematically, in part because in most countries the prevalence of cannabis use was low.
And, the approach of restricting attention to use in the last month does not allow estimates of the number of intensive users to be made with any precision.
However, as cannabis use has increased across Europe and concerns about cannabis problems have grown, this approach has had to be reconsidered.
In fact, nearly all EU countries now collect information on how many days the drug has been used in the month prior to interview.
Based on this information, it is estimated that around 3 million people may be using cannabis daily or almost daily.
However, this still provides only a blunt tool for identifying those who are suffering problems or dependence because of their use of cannabis.
This information is crucial to understanding the public health impact of cannabis consumption and is currently a key issue for the EMCDDA expert survey group.
From the survey evidence, it can be concluded that cannabis use increased markedly during the 1990s in almost all EU countries. This increase has continued until recently in many countries, although there are now signs of stabilisation in some countries, especially among what can be considered the high-prevalence group.
An example here is the United Kingdom, which in general terms often appears to be a ‘frontrunner’ in respect to drug-use trends.
During the early 1990s, the United Kingdom stood out as a high-prevalence country, reporting on most measures the highest prevalence figures in Europe.
However, last year prevalence levels among young adults (16–34) stabilised from 1998 and have fallen between 2003 and 2006 (20.0% to 16.3 %).
Interestingly, in the youngest age group (16–24), a steady decrease has been observed since 1998, suggesting that cannabis use has become less popular among the young (39).
Current work is under way to develop the methodological and conceptual framework necessary for monitoring ‘intensive forms of drug use’ that could be used in population surveys to better identify those experiencing problems.
Some countries are now starting to measure ‘dependence’ on or ‘problematic use’ of cannabis among the general population, with pioneering projects under way in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, the United Kingdom and, most recently, Spain.
An example of why this work is important can be found in the experience of the 2005 French survey which included the experimental CAST scale (cannabis abuse screening test); on this measure, a preliminary analysis suggested that as many as 16 % of those using cannabis in the last year and 58 % of daily users could be at risk of problematic use.
Levels of cannabis use in France, Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom prevalence levels in recent years (2002, 2003 and 2005 respectively), following a period of steady increases.
Again, some evidence of stabilisation in the situation is becoming apparent: France reported a decrease in use in 2005; and although Spain reports a slight increase until 2006, overall there are signs that the trend may be levelling off in the most recent data.
In the Czech Republic, a country with high prevalence rates, trends are difficult to assess within the data available — although the information for young adults suggests that prevalence levels may have fallen slightly.
Trends in cannabis use among adults
Among the middle and lower ranking countries in terms of last year prevalence among young adults (15–34 years), the latest data from Denmark and the Netherlands show a slight fall, while levels of use still appear to be increasing
40 in Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Norway (
Tracking trends in drug use in Europe is made difficult by the absence in many countries of reliable time series data.
However, an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s onwards, and these are now beginning to provide valuable insight into trends over time.
However, most of these increases are small and, in general, less pronounced in the more recent estimates.
Finland and Sweden remain among the countries reporting the lowest levels of cannabis use and, although prevalence

See Figure GPS-4 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.
In Sweden the situation appeared stable and slight decreases were noted in the other four surveys.
Cannabis: treatment demand data (41)
Treatment demand patterns overall estimates have increased, there is no suggestion of convergence with higher prevalence countries.
The increase observed in Sweden between 2000 and 2004 in last year prevalence among young adults (1.3% to 5.3 %), although large, is difficult to interpret because of methodological changes in the way the survey was conducted, and prevalence estimates in the 2004, 2005 and 2006 surveys suggest a stable situation.
Among school students
Among the total of 326 000 treatment demands reported in 2005 (data available from 21 countries), cannabis was the primary reason for entering treatment in about 20 % of all cases, making it the next most commonly reported drug after heroin. The greatest demand for treatment for primary

Another useful window on cannabis patterns and trends is provided by school survey data, which show levels of cannabis use increasing in many EU countries during the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Drug clinic clients are often reported as problematically using other drugs along with the primary drug for which they seek treatment; this is less often the case for cannabis users, who are the clients most often reported as using only one substance (cannabis).
Some, though, do use cannabis in combination with other drugs, most often alcohol (37 %) and amphetamines or ecstasy (28 %).
After alcohol (38 %), cannabis is reported as the second most frequently cited secondary substance by those receiving treatment (43).
Increasing treatment demands
Overall, the general picture emerging from the school survey data reflects that found in adult surveys.
The highest rates of lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among school students aged 15–16 years in Europe are reported by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, France and the United Kingdom: all report rates between 30 % and 44 % and Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Slovakia report rates above 25%.
As a point of contrast, Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Sweden, Turkey and Norway all report lifetime prevalence estimates lower than 10%. %.
Among the approximate 130 000 new demands for drug treatment, cannabis clients represent 29 % of all new drug clients, following closely the proportion of new heroin treatment demands (35%; data available from 22 countries) (44).
Over the period 1999–2005, the proportion of clients seeking treatment for primary cannabis use increased in all the countries that reported data (Figure 4).
However, there are interesting variations between countries, with cannabis being cited by less than 5 % of all clients reported as entering treatment in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland and Romania and by more than 30 % in Hungary and France. For the remaining countries, in 12 the proportion of

cannabis clients is between 5 % and 20 % and in seven it is between 21 % and 29%.
Similarly, among new treatment demands, there are considerable variations between countries, with cannabis being cited by less than 10 % of new clients in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland and Romania and by more than 50 % in Denmark, Germany, France and Hungary (46).
Whatever the explanatory factors that have led to increases in demand for cannabis treatment, the characteristics of those who end up seeking treatment are of interest, although it cannot be suggested that this tiny fraction of the cannabis-using population is representative.
Looking at the profile of people entering outpatient treatment for a primary cannabis use, the most common characteristics are being young, male, still in education as opposed to employed or unemployed, and living with their parents as opposed to having their own accommodation (47).
Compared to the other drug clients, people entering treatment for primary cannabis use have the highest proportion of males and the youngest age (mean age 24.5 years).
Those entering treatment for the first time are even younger than all cannabis clients (mean age 23.8); correspondingly 67 % and 80 % of those aged 15–19 or younger than 15 years are new cannabis clients.
However, in the last three years, indications of an increase in the age of new cannabis clients are reported (48).
Overall, cannabis clients can be divided into three groups: those who use it occasionally (34 %), those using it once to several times a week (27 %) and those using it daily (39 %).
The increase in the demand for cannabis treatment does not appear to have a simple explanation.
The extent to which increased demand for treatment is a result of increases in the prevalence of intensive cannabis and related problems in the population, and an increased perception of the risks remains unclear.
Other factors might have also contributed to it, including better data coverage of outpatient treatment agencies seeing cannabis clients, which are typically the centres for cannabis treatment demand, and possibly more diagnosis and reporting on problematic cannabis use.
Contributions from two other possible causes should also be considered: the diversification of the treatment offer, for example the opening of cannabis treatment centres in France in late 2004, and the increase in the number of referrals from the criminal justice system. In the first case, in response to increasing demand for cannabis treatment, several countries
There are differences between countries in the frequency of cannabis use, with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily cannabis users and the other half with less than 30%.
In addition, as discussed below,
) See Tables TDI-5 (part ii) and TDI-4 (part ii) in the 2007 statistical bulletin.)
See Tables TDI-13, TDI-14 and TDI-21 (part i) and (part ii) in the 2007 statistical bulletin. )
Although the extent to which this is a problem remains unclear, it remains an important question for planning services in this area.
the focus of responses to intensive cannabis use may be on prevention rather than treatment, and such differences in national practice may affect overall levels of reporting; this may in part explain why some high-prevalence countries report relatively low cannabis treatment figures.
Responding to cannabis problems
Data on cannabis treatment has to be seen in the context of what constitutes cannabis treatment in Europe, which currently covers a broad continuum of measures that range from brief interventions to treatment in residential settings.
In some of the programmes, the orientation is as much towards prevention and harm reduction as towards the treatment of drug problems.
France provides an example of a specialised service for cannabis users where 250 cannabis consultation centres have been created in 2005.
These centres are now seeing an estimated 2 900 clients per month with around a third of the clients (31 %) being self-referred, or referred by a third person (31 %) and just over a third being referred by court decision (38 %).
Other examples of specific treatment programmes for cannabis users include the Maria Youth Centre in Sweden, which provides young problematic cannabis users with a counselling programme, followed by support sessions.
And in Germany, a modular therapy of cannabis-related disorders for adolescents (Candis) has been developed at the Research Outpatient Department in Dresden since January 2006.
Quasi-compulsory interventions
Identifying those at risk and intervening early is recognised as an important component of all drug programmes, and teaching staff may be among the first to identify cannabis among their pupils.
Germany, Italy and Poland all have developed programmes for teachers that help them respond to cannabis use and seek specialist help when this is appropriate.
Despite a general move towards directing cannabis users coming into contact with the criminal justice system towards treatment and counselling services rather than penal sanctions, the availability and structure of these mechanisms differ substantially across Europe with few countries (Germany, France, Luxembourg, Austria, Sweden) reporting offering structured programmes or services.
For cannabis users referred from court services, treatment interventions are not the only kind of response noted.

New communication strategies for engaging with cannabis users
No strong evidence base exists to inform cannabis treatment practice, and research studies in this area are limited and mainly based on American and Australian experiences.
In Europe, the most common reported approaches to cannabis problems include: short-term outpatient services, counselling, school-based programmes and outreach prevention activities.
Generally, interventions appear to be based on brief-intervention approaches using a combination of motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioural elements.
Although no strong consensus exists on what constitutes effective practices, some studies have suggested this kind of approach can be useful.
One European initiative in this area is the Incant project, where Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland have cooperated on exploring the value of multidimensional family therapy (MDFT) with cannabis users.
Concerns have been raised that it may be inappropriate to treat young cannabis users in general drug services if this leads to clients
A number of innovative programmes in Europe attempt to exploit new communication tools for engaging with cannabis users.
Annual report 2007: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
In Denmark, SMASH is an anonymous support and counselling project for young cannabis users, intended to reduce the harmful effects, provide information and support to help them stop smoking cannabis (52
The project is based around subscription to two SMS packages.
The first of these (hashfacts) provides factual information about cannabis use and the second offers support and motivation to those attempting to stop taking drugs.
Young people can also receive personal coaching via text messages to help them stop or reduce their use of cannabis.
A similar service exists in Ireland, although the emphasis is on information dissemination.
Drug use and related problems among very young people (under 15 years old) — EMCDDA 2007 selected issue young people receive drug treatment in Europe.
Drug treatment tailored to the needs of young people is the exception, but most of the European countries have identified the need for such programmes.
The selected issue on the use of drugs by very young Europeans (under the age of 15) finds that the prevalence of drug use among this age group is low and mainly reflects experimental use. Regular use of drugs by very young people is rare, and it often concerns a highly problematic section of the population.
The selected issue also looks at how recognition of the links between the consumption of licit and illicit psychoactive substances at a young age and substance dependence later in life has been worked into European public health policies.
The primary response to drug use among the under-15s largely centres on prevention or early intervention strategies.
Nevertheless, the selected issue estimates that around 4 000 very

Ecstasy refers to synthetic substances that are chemically related to amphetamines but which differ to some extent in their effects.
The best-known member of the ecstasy group of drugs is 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), but other analogues are also occasionally found in ecstasy tablets (MDA, MDEA).
The prevalence of ecstasy use in the EU has been increasing since the 1990s.
In many European countries, the second most commonly used illicit substance is some form of synthetically produced drug, although on a European scale, there are now more users of cocaine.
The use of these substances among the general population is typically low, but prevalence rates among younger age groups are significantly higher, and in some social settings or cultural groups the use of these drugs may be particularly high.
Globally, amphetamines (amphetamine and methamphetamine) and ecstasy are among the most prevalent synthetic illicit drugs.
Historically, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has been by far the best-known hallucinogenic drug, but overall consumption levels have been low and somewhat stable for a considerable time.
Recently, evidence of increased availability and use of naturally occurring hallucinogenic substances, hallucinogenic mushrooms in particular, has emerged.
Amphetamine and methamphetamine are central nervous system stimulants.
Of the two drugs, amphetamine is by far the more commonly available in Europe whereas significant methamphetamine use appears to be restricted to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Supply and availability (53)
Amphetamine and methamphetamine: differences and similarities
Global amphetamine production was estimated at 88 tonnes in 2005 (UNODC, 2007). Although illicit manufacture has extended to other parts of the world, it is still concentrated in western and central Europe.
Laboratories manufacturing illicit amphetamine were dismantled in 2005 in Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Estonia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Poland.
Amphetamine seized in Europe is reported to come mainly from Belgium, the Netherlands and Poland, and to a lesser extent from Estonia and Lithuania.
On the illicit drugs market, the main representatives of the amphetamines group are amphetamine and methamphetamine (and their salts) — two closely related synthetic substances, members of the phenethylamine family.
Both substances are central nervous system stimulants, which share the same mechanism of action, behavioural effects, tolerance, withdrawal and prolonged use (chronic) effects.
Amphetamine is less potent than methamphetamine, but in uncontrolled situations the effects are almost indistinguishable.
Globally, 12.9 tonnes of amphetamine was seized in 2005, most of it in two regions: western and central Europe and east and south-east Asia.
Amphetamine and methamphetamine products mostly consist of powders, but ice, the pure crystalline hydrochloride salt of methamphetamine is also used.
Tablets containing either amphetamine or methamphetamine may carry logos similar to those seen on MDMA and other ecstasy tablets.
Given the physical forms in which they are available, amphetamine and methamphetamine may be ingested, snorted, inhaled and, less commonly, injected.
Unlike the sulphate salt of amphetamine, methamphetamine hydrochloride, particularly the crystalline form (ice), is sufficiently volatile to be smoked.
In 2005, an estimated 40 300 seizures of amphetamine, amounting to 6.6 tonnes, were made in Europe.
Until 2004, the United Kingdom has consistently accounted for the greatest number of seizures and the largest quantities of amphetamine intercepted in Europe.
Despite some fluctuations, at European level, both the overall number of amphetamine seizures and quantities seized have increased since 2000 (54).
In 2005, however, a majority of reporting countries recorded a downward trend in the number of amphetamine seizures made. This picture
Data on seizures and quantities seized of amphetamine, ecstasy and LSD are not available for all countries for 2005; see the seizure tables in the 2007 statistical bulletin for more information. )
See Tables SZR-11 and SZR-12 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.
International action against the manufacture and diversion of drug precursors
The average or typical retail purity of amphetamine in 2005 varied considerably, but most European countries reported purities between 15 % and 50 % (56).
Several international initiatives have been set up to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs: Project Cohesion focuses on potassium permanganate (used in the manufacture of cocaine) and acetic anhydride (used in the manufacture of heroin), while
Project Prism addresses synthetic drugs precursors (1
All data below come from the INCB report on precursors (INCB, 2007b).
Global methamphetamine production was estimated at 278 tonnes in 2005.
It is mostly manufactured in east and south-east Asia and in North America.
In Europe, illicit manufacture of methamphetamine is still largely limited to the Czech Republic (under the local name of ‘pervitin’), although production is also reported in Lithuania, Moldova and Slovakia (INCB, 2007a; UNODC, 2007).
In 2005, global potassium permanganate seizures were the largest ever reported to the INCB with 16 countries intercepting 183 tonnes, almost all of which was seized outside Europe.
Of the 22 400 litres of acetic anhydride seized worldwide in 2005, again Europe accounted for only a small proportion.
In 2005, global seizures of methamphetamine increased to an estimated 17.1 tonnes, over half of it being reported by east and south-east Asia (China, Thailand), and a third by North America (United States). In the same year, an estimated 2 200 seizures, amounting to about 104 kg of methamphetamine were reported in 15 European
In 2005, seizures of 41 tonnes of ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine, key precursors of methamphetamine, were reported to the INCB, most of them by China, while EU Member States (mainly Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Greece and Romania), together with the Russian Federation, accounted for 1.7 tonnes.
numbers of seizures and quantities of methamphetamine intercepted.
The average or typical retail price of methamphetamine (reported by a few countries only) varied in 2005 between EUR 5 and EUR 35 per gram. Most countries reported average or typical retail purities of methamphetamine in the
Global seizures of 1-phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P), used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and amphetamine, amounted to 2 900 litres in 2005, with European countries contributing 1 700 litres (mostly in Germany and the Netherlands).

Europe’s share of global seizures of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone (3,4-MDP-2-P), used to manufacture MDMA, decreased in 2005 to 38 % with 5 100 litres being reported (mostly in France and the Netherlands).
The increasing seizures of 3,4-MDP-2-P in other regions seem to indicate that illicit manufacture of MDMA is expanding beyond Europe.

Prevalence and patterns among the general population and youth
In terms of measures of recent use, ecstasy is now the most commonly used synthetic drug in 17 European countries, and amphetamines in nine (63).
Ever in lifetime prevalence of about 16.3 million ecstasy tablets in Europe in 2005 (59).
The largest quantities of ecstasy continue to be seized in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.
After a peak in 2001, ecstasy seizures made in Europe have been on the increase again since 2003.
The total amount of ecstasy intercepted has been fluctuating at around 20 million tablets per year between 2000 and 2004.
In 2005, however, the available data show a decrease in the quantities of ecstasy seized in a majority of countries.
This picture should be confirmed against 2005 data from the United Kingdom when available.
In 2005, the average or typical retail cost of ecstasy tablets ranged from less than EUR 3 per tablet to EUR 15 (60
Over amphetamines tends to be higher, reflecting the more recent emergence of ecstasy on the illicit drug market in Europe.
Data from school surveys suggest that use by school students of ecstasy, amphetamine and psychotropic drugs other than cannabis cluster among a few individuals.
For example, school students who have tried ecstasy also report prevalence rates for use of cocaine and hallucinogenic drugs that are more than 20 times higher than in the general school student population (64) and around five times higher than among those who have never used cannabis.
Among EU Member States, use of amphetamines or ecstasy appears to be relatively high in only a few countries: the Czech Republic, Estonia and the United Kingdom; and, to a lesser extent in Latvia and the Netherlands.
In Europe, most ecstasy tablets continued in 2005 to contain MDMA or another ecstasy-like substance (MDEA, MDA), usually as the only psychoactive substance present.
In 10 Member States, such tablets accounted for more than 80 % of the total number of tablets analysed.
There are some exceptions to this finding: in Slovenia MDMA/MDEA/MDA are more frequently found in combination with amphetamine and/or methamphetamine; while in Poland, amphetamine and/or methamphetamine are more frequently found as the only psychoactive substances in the tablets analysed.
The MDMA content of ecstasy tablets varies greatly between batches (even between those with the same logo) both between and within countries.
In 2005, the average or typical content of MDMA per ecstasy tablet ranged from 2 to 130 mg in reporting countries, although in most countries the average was between 30 and 80 mg of MDMA.

Half of the countries and trafficked to a much smaller extent than other synthetic drugs, an estimated 800 seizures, amounting to 850 000 LSD units, were made in Europe in 2005, with the Netherlands accounting for about 75 % of the total amount seized.

reported by Norway (5.9%), Germany (5.4%) and Latvia (5.3%).
On average, 5.1% of young European adults have tried amphetamines (67).
Last year use in this age group ranges from 0.1% to 2.9%, with Estonia (2.9%), the United Kingdom (2.6%) and Latvia (2.4%) reporting the highest prevalence rates (Figure 5).
It is notable that, when last year use is considered, the figures from the United Kingdom and Denmark are more in line with those of other countries.
It is estimated that, on average, 1.5 % of young European adults have used amphetamines in the last year.
Historically, methamphetamine use in Europe use has been concentrated in the Czech Republic and to some extent Slovakia.
Recent estimates of problem methamphetamine use are reported by two countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia).
In 2005, in the Czech Republic there were estimated to be 18 400–24 000 methamphetamine users (2.5 to 3.2 cases per 1000 aged 15–64 years), almost twice the number of problem opioid users, and in Slovakia, 6 000–14 000 methamphetamine users (1.5 to 3.7 cases per 1 000 aged 15–64 years), slightly less than the estimated number of opioid users.
Methamphetamine has become the most frequent primary drug among those demanding treatment for the first time in Slovakia, and high levels of methamphetamine use have now been reported among some subpopulation groups in Hungary.
Levels of methamphetamine use in Europe appear limited, in contrast to the international picture, which has seen a growth in the use of this drug in recent years. European countries are concerned, however, about the potential of

Ever in lifetime use of LSD among adults ranges from 0.2 % to 5.5%, with two thirds of countries reporting lifetime prevalence rates between 0.4% and 1.7%.
Among young adults (15–34 years), lifetime prevalence of LSD use ranges from 0.3% to 7.6%, and among the 15–24 age group it varies from 0 to 4.2%.
Last year use of this drug is low, and in the 15–24 age group exceeds 1 % only in seven countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy, Latvia, Hungary, Poland).
Trends
Ecstasy has been tried by 0.3–7.2% of all European adults.
Half of the countries report lifetime prevalence rates of 2.5% or lower, with the highest prevalence rates being reported by the United Kingdom (7.2%), the Czech Republic (7.1%), Spain (4.4%) and the Netherlands (4.3%).
The prevalence of last year use of ecstasy ranges from 0.2 % to 3.5 % of adults, with the highest rates reported by the Czech Republic (3.5%), Estonia (1.7%) and the United Kingdom (1.6%), although half of the countries report prevalence rates of 0.5 % or below.
It is estimated that almost 9.5 million Europeans (3 % on average) have tried ecstasy, and almost 3 million have used it in the last year.
Overall in Europe, there is continuing evidence of stabilising or even decreasing trends in amphetamine and ecstasy consumption.
Amphetamine use among young adults (15–34) has declined substantially in the United Kingdom (England and Wales) since 1996, and to a lesser extent in Denmark and the Czech Republic, while in other countries the prevalence levels appear largely stable, although some small increases are reported (72).

A question arising from the data in some countries (Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom) is whether cocaine is replacing amphetamines and ecstasy as the stimulant drug of choice (75).
Among the 15–24 age group, higher rates of lifetime prevalence of ecstasy are found among males (0.3–23.2%) than among females (0.3–13.9%).
In recent school surveys, increases in lifetime prevalence of ecstasy use occurred largely in parallel among both male and female school students, although there is a progressive increase in the gender gap with increasing age.

Although data available on the combined use of drugs and alcohol remains limited, consumption of alcohol in recreational dance music settings, often in quantities considered hazardous to health and in combination with stimulant drugs, is a growing cause for concern.
Treatment demand data
The number of demands for treatment relating to the use of amphetamines and ecstasy is relatively small. In general, this form of drug use is rarely the primary reason for attending drug treatment in most of the 21 countries for which data

See Figure TDI-2 (part ii) and Table TDI-5 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.)

Czech Republic and Slovakia report a substantial proportion of treatment requests related to primary use of amphetamines (correspondingly 58 % and 24 % of all clients), mostly, they relate to a primary methamphetamine problem; Sweden, Finland and Latvia report around a third of all drug clients entering treatment for primary amphetamines use; Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France report between 1 % and 5 % of patients entering treatment for primary ecstasy use (80).
factors play in shaping attitudes to drug use and in the importance of challenging the belief that drug use is a normal or acceptable behaviour.
This kind of approach is of particular relevance to prevention work in settings that are culturally associated with drug taking.
The high prevalence of drug use in some recreational settings, such as clubs, bars and dance events means that these locations have been identified as appropriate targets for drug demand reduction initiatives.
The need to further develop prevention activities in recreational settings is also noted in the EU drug action plan (2005–08).
In all countries, except Greece and Sweden, the proportion of new clients entering treatment for primary use of amphetamines and ecstasy is greater than the proportion of

One approach has been to make information material that may have prevention and, sometimes, harm-reduction messages available in recreational settings.
Material is usually developed in a user-friendly style that reflects the youth culture of the target group, and is sometimes distributed through mobile outreach teams.
To engage with young people, outreach teams usually take a non-judgmental approach and, while stating that the safest option is not to take drugs at all, may also provide harm-reduction advice (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Austria, Portugal).
Clients entering treatment for use of stimulants other than cocaine are on average around 27 years old (26 if they enter treatment for the first time) and used the drug for the first time at an average age of 19 (83).
Ecstasy clients are, along with cannabis users, the youngest group entering drug treatment.
In the Netherlands the highest proportion of women in drug treatment is reported among the ecstasy clients.
The proportion of women among amphetamines clients is higher than that for other drugs, with the highest proportion of outpatient female clients reported in the youngest age group (84
Amphetamines clients usually consume the drug in combination with other substances, mainly cannabis and alcohol, and in some countries injecting is commonly reported (85
In addition, to responses that aim at informing and persuading individuals not to use drugs, an increasing number of Member States are also developing approaches to better regulate recreational environments.
Some of these approaches, including running explicitly drug-free events, have attempted to alter the beliefs held by some that drug use facilitates their leisure activities.
In an increasing number of countries (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Norway), there appears to be an interest among municipalities in establishing closer contact with the leisure industry and developing approaches to limit the availability of drugs and reduce the health risks in dance music and other settings.
For example, safe clubbing guidelines, such as those developed in the United Kingdom (86), are now being produced in a number of countries.
Drug prevention activities
Among the most frequently used responses to the use of ecstasy, amphetamines and psychotropic drugs are targeted public information campaigns and, increasingly, Internet sites. Prevention strategies have made use of the Internet to establish low-threshold contact with young people who take ecstasy, amphetamines or other

Cocaine, after cannabis, is the second most trafficked illicit drug in the world.
Global seizures of cocaine have continued to increase in 2005 to now total 756 tonnes, with the largest quantities of the drug intercepted in South America, followed by North America.

The mean prices of cocaine, corrected for inflation, showed an overall downward trend over the period 2000–05 in most of the 19 countries reporting sufficient data.
Colombia remains by far the largest source of illicit coca in the world, followed by Peru and Bolivia (UNODC, 2007).
Most of the cocaine seized in Europe comes from South America, either directly or via Central America, the Caribbean and West Africa.

Data available over the period 2000–05 indicate an overall decrease in the mean purity of cocaine in most of the 21 reporting countries.
Prevalence and patterns of cocaine use
The main point of entry in Europe remains the Iberian peninsula, with Portugal appearing to be increasingly important.
Cocaine is also directly imported into other countries, with the Netherlands remaining a key entry point.
Both Spain and the Netherlands are regarded as main distribution centres for the drug.
Imports from outside Europe are also reported by a number of other countries including Belgium, Germany, France and the United Kingdom; and distribution may also be diversifying, with reports of increased activity through eastern and central Europe and both EU and neighbouring countries sometimes now reported as secondary transit locations.
figures on reported ever in lifetime use range from 0.2 to 7.3%, with three countries reporting values of more than 5 %
In 2005, an estimated 70 000 seizures of cocaine, amounting to 107 tonnes, were made in Europe.
Most seizures of cocaine continue to be reported in western
Use of cocaine in the last year is reported by at least 4.5 million Europeans (1.3% on average).
Last year use of cocaine ranges from 0.1% in Greece to 3.0% in Spain,

Signs of stabilisation in cocaine use among young adults noted in the 2006 annual report are not supported by recent data.
Increases in the last year prevalence of cocaine use among the 15–34 age group have been registered in all countries reporting recent survey data, although there may be some levelling off in Spain and the United Kingdom (England and Wales), the Member States with the highest prevalence levels.
Notable increases were also reported by Italy and Denmark (Figure 7).

However, it should be noted that last year and last month prevalence levels of cocaine use are much lower.
Use of cocaine is not confined to certain social groups, but use of the drug by socially integrated young adults in recreational settings can reach higher levels than those reported in general population surveys.
Studies targeting dance music settings in several European countries revealed lifetime prevalence of cocaine use ranging from 10 % to
Analysis of data for countries with longer time series and appreciable prevalence rates can allow detection of trends within subgroups of the population.
In both Spain and the United Kingdom, the increase in prevalence was generally greater among males than among females.
The reported increase in last year cocaine prevalence in Spain since 2001 can be attributed to increased levels of use in the 15–24 age group, rather than across 15–34 year olds as a whole.
Patterns of cocaine use vary greatly between different groups of users.

A recent evaluation of service provision in the United Kingdom also reported some positive outcomes among crack cocaine clients in residential care (Weaver, 2007).
Treatment services are, therefore, likely to be faced with offering care to three populations, which can be characterised in simple terms as: first, socially more integrated cocaine users who may also have a history of regular ‘recreational’ polydrug use including alcohol; secondly, cocaine users who may also have opioid problems; and thirdly, highly marginalised and problematic crack cocaine users.
Recreational cocaine users are at risk not only of developing a dependent drug habit, but also through the interaction of cocaine use with other drugs or with coexisting cardiovascular problems.
Most European countries report that cocaine users can access information about cocaine and the risks of cocaine use through various information sources such as websites, helplines and through other media.
It is interesting to note that the European Foundation of Drug Helplines reports an increase in the number of calls related to cocaine during 2005 and 2006 (114).
The needs of these three groups are likely to be different and require different approaches from service providers.
Most reported cocaine treatment in Europe takes place in outpatient settings, which in many cases will be orientated to the needs of opioid users.
It is questionable how attractive such services are to relatively well-integrated cocaine users who have developed problems through their recreational use of the drug.
And it is likely that a proportion of this group will seek help either through generic healthcare providers, such as general practitioners or counsellors or, if they are able, through private specialised clinics.
In contrast to opioid treatment, pharmacological options for cocaine treatment are limited, although prescribing can be helpful in providing relief for related symptoms.
Although small in number, crack cocaine users are likely to be at particularly high risk of experiencing problems and may be difficult to engage in treatment and other services.
In some cities where significant crack cocaine problems exist, harm-reduction programmes have attempted to intervene by providing outreach, crisis intervention, assistance for acute medical problems as well as referral to structured services. For example, in Vienna, rooms are available through outpatient services to provide a safe space for cocaine and crack users who are often suffering from anxiety, and basic healthcare and referral to other services are offered.
Cocaine and crack cocaine: a growing public health issue — EMCDDA 2007 selected issue given to the health consequences of cocaine, which are often not well recognised in existing reporting systems.
The selected issue looks in detail at the challenges to providing effective treatment for cocaine and crack cocaine dependence, which has proved to be particularly difficult, not least because of the very varied types of cocaine users and their differing needs.
In recent years, there have been signs that cocaine use is a growing problem in Europe.
This selected issue shows that, in some European countries, there has been a marked increase in the use of cocaine, in treatment demands for cocaine and in seizures of the drug.
The potential for cocaine use to have a major impact on public health is examined.

Heroin supply and availability (115
In Europe, historically, two forms of imported heroin have been used: the commonly available brown heroin (its chemical base form) mainly from Afghanistan, and the less common and more expensive white heroin (a salt form) which typically originates from south-east Asia — although this form of the drug is now becoming increasingly rare.
A small amount of opioid drugs are also produced within Europe, but manufacture is mainly confined in 2005 to small-scale production of home-made poppy products (e.g. poppy straw, poppy concentrate from crushed poppy stalks or heads) in a number of eastern European countries (Latvia, Lithuania, Poland).
Production and trafficking the mid-1990s, heroin has been increasingly (but to a lesser extent than through the Balkan route) smuggled to Europe through the ‘silk route’ via central Asian Republics, the Caspian Sea and the Russian Federation, Belarus or Ukraine, to Estonia, Latvia, some of the Nordic countries, Germany and Bulgaria.
Although these routes are the most important, countries in the Arabian peninsula (Oman, United Arab Emirates) have become transit sites for heroin consignments from south-west and south-east Asia (INCB, 2006), with some of it being then smuggled through eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius), and sometimes through western Africa as well (Nigeria), to be shipped to illicit markets in Europe and to a lesser extent North America (INCB, 2007a).
There are also reports of heroin from south-west Asia being smuggled to Europe via countries in south and east Asia (India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, China).
In 2005, 342 tonnes of opium, 32 tonnes of morphine and 58 tonnes of heroin were seized worldwide.
Asia (China, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan) continued to account for the greatest quantities of heroin (54 %) seized worldwide, followed by Europe (38 %) (UNODC, 2007).
Heroin consumed in Europe is predominantly manufactured in Afghanistan, which remains the world leader in illicit opium supply, followed by Myanmar.
It is estimated that about 6 610 tonnes of opium was produced in 2006, 92 % of which in Afghanistan.
This represents a 43 % increase compared to the 2005 estimate, due to a substantial increase in the area under cultivation.
Global potential production of heroin was estimated at 606 tonnes in 2006, up from 472 tonnes in 2005 (UNODC, 2007).
Opioid seizures and laboratories dismantled seem to indicate that opium produced in Afghanistan is increasingly being converted into morphine or heroin before being exported (CND, 2007).
An estimated 52 000 seizures resulted in the interception of about 16.8 tonnes of heroin in the EU Member States and candidate countries and Norway in 2005.
The United Kingdom (based on 2004 data) continued to account for the highest number of seizures made in Europe, followed by Spain, Germany and Greece, while Turkey seized the largest quantities (followed by the United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands), accounting for nearly half of the total amount intercepted in 2005 (116).
Seizures of heroin show an overall decline between 2000 and 2003 and, based on data available, have been increasing since then.
Over the period 2000–05, total quantities of heroin seized in EU Member States have been fluctuating within a slightly downward trend, whereas a large increase is reported in Turkey over the
Heroin enters Europe by two major trafficking routes.
The historically important, and shortest, Balkan route continues to play a crucial role in heroin smuggling.
Following transit through Pakistan, Iran and Turkey, the route then diverges into a southern branch through Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Albania, Italy, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina and a northern branch through Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Germany and the Netherlands; the latter operating as a secondary distribution centre to other western European countries.

This should be checked against missing 2005 data when available.
Annual report 2007: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
This translates into some 1.5 million (1.3–1.7 million) problem opioid users in the EU and Norway.
However, these estimates are far from robust and more extensive data are required.
Detecting trends in both price and purity is hampered by a lack of consistent data, and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries (118).
Most countries reported average or typical street price of brown heroin in the range EUR 35–80 per gram.
Between 2000 and 2005 mean heroin prices, corrected for inflation, appear to have decreased in most of the 18 countries providing comparable data.
The average or typical purity of brown heroin at street level was reported to vary considerably, with most countries reporting values between 15 % and 50%; figures for white heroin tended to be higher (30–70%), where it was available.
The mean purity of heroin products has been fluctuating in most of the 18 reporting countries since 2000.
A lack of reliable historical data complicates the assessment of trends over time in problem opioid use and trends should thus be interpreted with caution.
Reports from some countries suggest that problem opioid use may, on average, have stabilised somewhat in recent years.
Data from repeated estimates on problem opioid use for the period between 2001 and 2005 are only available from eight countries and provide a relatively stable picture with only one country (Austria) showing a clear increase (120).
Data in this section are derived from the EMCDDA problem drug use (PDU) indicator, which includes mainly estimates of injecting drug use and the use of opioids, although in a few countries, users of amphetamines are also an important component (119
Moreover, as most studies are based on a localised geographical area, such as a city or district, extrapolation to generate national estimates is difficult.
Estimation is also complicated as patterns of problem drug use in Europe appear to be becoming more diverse.
For example, polydrug use problems have become progressively more important in most countries, and some countries where opioid problems (almost exclusively heroin problems) have historically predominated now report changes towards other drugs, such as cocaine.
Recent estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use at national level range roughly between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15–64.
In comparison, the full PDU prevalence is estimated to be between one and eight cases per 1 000.
Some of the lowest well-documented estimates available are from the new countries of the EU, although this is not the case for Malta, where a relatively high prevalence has been reported (5.8–6.7 cases per 1 000 aged 15–64) (Figure 8).
Despite the general indication that the overall trend in the prevalence of opioid use is relatively stable, there are indications of increases in heroin seizures (see above), possibly relating to increased availability of heroin on the European market, and increasing reports of the use of opioids diverted from legitimate uses.
In Italy, estimates of the incidence of heroin use based on treatment demand data suggest a rise since 1998, after a period of decline, with an annual incidence in 2005 of around 30 000 new heroin users.
In Austria, also, the proportion of those under age 25 has increased among new substitution treatment clients, suggesting a rise in the number of young people experiencing problems, associated with the diversion and uncontrolled use of prescribed opioids.
Similarly, after a period of decline, the Czech Republic reports an increase in the injecting of a diverted substance (in this case, buprenorphine), and information available from Belgium suggests that there has been an increase in the illicit use of methadone.
Recent monitoring of low-threshold services in France raises concerns about the illicit use of buprenorphine, including injecting use, and use among young people who have initiated their problem drug use with buprenorphine rather than heroin; concerns about new subgroups of young and marginalised injectors have also been reported.
In Finland, heroin also appears to have been largely replaced by buprenorphine among new opioid treatment demands and buprenorphine is increasingly mentioned in reports on overdose deaths.
Although the technical definition used by the EMCDDA for PDU is ‘injecting drug use or long duration/regular use of opioids, cocaine and/or amphetamines’, problem drug use estimates have principally reflected heroin use.
In the few countries where problematic use of amphetamines is reported, well-documented estimates are available.
Estimates of problematic cocaine use are scarce and the PDU indicator is, except in few high-prevalence countries, likely to be less reliable for this drug.) See Figure PDU-4 (part ii) in the 2007 statistical bulletin.

Injecting drug users (IDUs) are at high risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use, such as blood-borne infections (e.g. HIV/AIDS, hepatitis) or drug overdose.
Despite their importance for public health, few countries are currently able to provide estimates of the levels of injecting drug use (Figure 9) and, therefore, improving the monitoring of this special population is an important challenge for the development of health monitoring systems in Europe.
Extrapolation from the limited data available must be done with caution, but does suggest an average prevalence of IDU (current injectors) of between three and four cases per 1 000 of the adult population.
This would mean there may be around 1.1 million (0.9–1.3 million) injectors in the EU and Norway today.
These are predominantly opioid injectors, although they may inject other drugs as well, and some countries report a significant amphetamine or methamphetamine injecting problem (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden).
Trends in injecting drug use from treatment demand data
The lack of data makes drawing conclusions on trends in injecting difficult, although one window on this behaviour is provided by data on drug users entering treatment.
Treatment demands among opioid users, for example, may give an indication of patterns of use in the wider population.
The proportion of injectors among all primary heroin users entering drug treatment (2001–05) shows marked differences in levels of injecting between countries.
Overall, these data suggest that injecting may be becoming less popular, with declines observed by Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Hungary, the United Kingdom and Turkey.
Most available estimates of injecting drug use are derived from either fatal overdose rates or data on infectious diseases (such as HIV). Considerable variation is reported between countries, with national estimates typically ranging between 0.5 and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15–64, in the period 2001–05.
An exception is Estonia, where a much higher estimate of 15 cases per 1 000 has been reported.
Of the other countries able to provide data, the highest estimates have been reported from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Finland and the United Kingdom, at between four and five cases per 1 000 population aged 15–64, and the lowest figures from Cyprus, Hungary and the Netherlands, at under one case per 1 000.

The pattern of subnational prevalence estimates depends much on availability and location of studies within a country.
Target groups may vary slightly owing to different studies’ methods and data sources; therefore, comparisons should be made with caution.
For more details see Tables PDU-1, PDU-2 and PDU-3 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.
Prescribing practice for substitution treatment in Europe seen everywhere, for example in several of the new Member States, injection appears to remain the predominant mode of heroin administration.
It should be noted that trends in injecting in non-heroin users may be different.
Treatment of opioid dependence
Over the past 15 years, the provision of treatment for heroin dependence has seen large increases in the EU.
According to available data, this is mainly due to a more than sevenfold increase of substitution treatment provision in the EU-15 Member States, since 1993.
Maintenance treatment
With the exception of five countries (the Czech Republic, France, Latvia, Finland, Sweden), methadone is by far the most commonly used drug for substitution purposes, accounting for around 72 % of all substitution treatments (121).
A relatively robust evidence base supported by data from treatment outcome studies and controlled trials now exists for the effectiveness of drug substitution treatments in treating dependence on heroin or other opioids (see Gossop, 2006 for a review).
Positive effects have been shown in reducing the use of illicit drugs, health risk behaviours and criminality and improved social functioning. Substitution treatment programmes usually include, as well as a prescribing element, other interventions to support behavioural change.
Generally, the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance.
) See Tables HSR-7, HSR-9 and HSR-11 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.
Quality assurance and substitution treatment
In recent years, there has been interest across the EU in additional pharmacological agents for treating drug dependence, and the use of buprenorphine, in particular, has become more common.
In 2005, Slovenia and in May 2006, Malta joined the group of European countries licensing buprenorphine maintenance treatment at specialised units (122), and currently Bulgaria, Hungary,
Concerns have been expressed that some substitution treatment programmes are of poor quality, with the focus of activities too much on prescribing and not sufficient attention paid to providing a more comprehensive package of social and medical support.
Criticisms made also include: the lack of adequate clinical monitoring; poor prescribing practices leading to diversion of drugs onto the illicit market; and, that low-dose treatment programmes are not in line with the clinical evidence on effectiveness (Loth et al., 2007; Schifano et al., 2006; Strang et al., 2005).
Many countries have taken these concerns seriously, and Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom all report that reviews are under way with the objective of improving the quality of care provided.
Similarly, Denmark has recently completed a three-year project to document the impact of wider psychosocial support in substitution treatment and to test quality assurance processes.
One reason for interest in the use of buprenorphine is that it is arguably a more suitable pharmaceutical option than methadone for use in community practice.
This issue is a complex one and is discussed in detail in the 2005 selected issue on buprenorphine.
In most countries buprenorphine can only be prescribed by trained, accredited physicians and is subject to regulation appropriate to its controlled status under the international conventions (Schedule III of the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances).
In Germany, two recent studies have examined substitution therapy practice and looked at possibilities for improving care (COBRA) and explored quality assurance issues resulting in a new manual for medical practitioners (ASTO).
In the United Kingdom, an audit was recently undertaken in England to analyse prescribing and clinical management practices and assess the extent to which they are in line with existing clinical guidelines.
Buprenorphine is marketed in the form of sublingual tablets, and although it is not considered a particularly attractive substance to inject, reports exist that tablets have been dissolved and injected.
The potential for misuse of buprenorphine is supported by reports from some countries of the diversion of the drug onto the illicit market.
To deter illicit use of buprenorphine, a new formulation of the drug, in combination with naloxone, has been developed.
This formulation, Suboxone, received a European marketing authorisation in 2006.
The availability of national clinical guidelines, standards and treatment protocols is important in ensuring the quality of substitution treatment.
National clinical guidelines and treatment protocols are reported to be in preparation or being revised in Demark, Ireland, Hungary, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Norway, and Slovakia published guidance on methadone treatment administration in 2004.
In the Netherlands, maintenance treatment is now increasingly realised according to medical treatment standards, and administration of methadone is supervised during the first phase of treatment.
In Austria, two decrees laying down the framework of medically assisted treatment were drafted in 2005, with the aim to improve substitution treatment and include measures on supervised consumption as well as regulation of physicians operating in this area.
A national monitoring system for reporting on clients in substitution treatment programmes also provides information useful for assessing the quality and availability of services.
Currently, such schemes are reported to exist in 17 Member States, and national substitution registers are in preparation in Belgium and Luxembourg, while an expansion of the existing register to all health centres is being implemented in the Czech Republic.
In January 2007, the Netherlands introduced heroin assisted treatment as a possible option for treating opioid dependence, expanding the number of treatment places to around 1 000, and therefore joined the United Kingdom as one of the two European countries where this option is available.
Overall, the number of clients receiving heroin in Europe is very small, and treatment is usually reserved for particularly chronic cases where other therapeutic options have proved unsuccessful.
The efficacy of heroin as a substitution agent has also been explored in experimental research in both Spain (March et al., 2006) and Germany (Naber and Haasen, 2006).
Both studies reported positive treatment findings, suggesting that this approach may prove an appropriate treatment modality for socially excluded opioid users with severe problems who have responded poorly to other treatment options.
Together with earlier work, these studies on heroin prescription have stimulated debate about the need for this treatment option to be more widely available.
Procedure for European marketing authorisation for medicinal products
Information available from the treatment demand indicator (TDI) does not cover all people in drug treatment, which is a considerably greater number; only clients requesting treatment during the reported year are recorded, but a pilot project is currently being implemented in 2007, aiming to extend the European data collection to treatment clients in continuous treatment (123) and assess reporting coverage of national systems.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is responsible for the scientific evaluation of applications for European marketing authorisation for medicinal products.
Medicines approved through the centralised procedure obtain a single marketing authorisation which is valid in all Member States of the European Union.
All authorised medicinal products are also monitored for safety.
This is conducted through the EU network of national medicines agencies, in close cooperation with healthcare professionals and the pharmaceutical companies themselves.
In many countries, opioids, mainly heroin, remain the principal drug for which clients seek treatment.
Of the total 326 000 treatment requests reported in 2005 under the treatment demand indicator, opioids were recorded as the principal drug in about 40 % of cases, with around 46 % of these clients reporting injecting the drug (124).
The EMEA publishes a European public assessment report (EPAR) for every centrally authorised product that is granted a marketing authorisation; EPARs are published on the EMEA website (http://www.emea.europa.eu/) and a summary for the public is available in all official languages of the EU.
Treatment data
Some countries report a significant proportion of treatment demands relating to opioids other than heroin.
In Finland, other opioids, especially buprenorphine are reported to be a primary drug of use by 41 % of drug clients and in France 7.5 % of all clients are reported as using buprenorphine.
In the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, around 4 % of clients are reported as primary methadone users.
In Spain, Latvia and Sweden, between 5 % and 7 % of drug clients are entering treatment for primary use of unspecified opioids other than heroin or methadone (125).
And in Hungary, where the use of home-made opium poppy products has a long history, around 4 % of treatment requests are related to opium.
The EMCDDA collects two types of information to describe treatment in Europe.
The treatment demand indicator is based on the monitoring of characteristics of clients entering treatment across Europe.
In addition, Member States are asked to provide data that describes the overall structure and availability of services.
Data from the treatment demand indicator
Most opioid users are reported by outpatient treatment units; however, in Sweden 71 % of opioid clients are reported by inpatient centres, indicating that services are differently structured in this country.
A small percentage (3 %) of inpatient treatment demands for opioid clients is also reported by the United Kingdom (126).
In the few countries reporting data on treatment demand in low-threshold agencies, a significant proportion of drug clients seek treatment for primary opioid use (127).
Data from the monitoring of clients entering drug treatment in Europe provides a window not only on the wider epidemiological situation in respect to patterns of use and trends but also on the relative demand and availability of different forms of treatment.
This can cause difficulties in interpreting the available information, as an increase in those being treated for a particular drug problem may indicate that demand for services have gone up or that availability of a particular kind of service has increased.
As an aid to the analysis of this sort of data, a distinction is made between new and all treatment demands, with the assumption that new treatment demands better reflect changes in broader patterns of drug taking and all treatments better reflect the overall demands made on the treatment sector as whole.
The relative proportion of treatment demands made by non-opioid clients is increasing in the TDI data set and actual numbers of new clients demanding treatment for opioid use is also falling in many countries, with the absolute number of reported new treatment demands for primary heroin use decreasing from 80 000 in 1999 to 51 000 in 2005 (128).
) See http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/?nnodeid=1420 (meeting report 2006).)
See Table TDI-114 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.)
See Table TDI-119 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.)
In the EU Member States and Norway, in 2005, it is estimated that the number of drug substitution treatments was at least 585 000. This estimate is based on treatment monitoring carried out in most countries and provides a general picture of service availability.
These figures are probably a minimum estimate, as some treatment modalities are likely to be under-reported, for example treatment provided by general practitioners or in prison settings.
For EU countries where estimates of problem opioid use were available for 2005, the extent of substitution treatment among problem opioid users was calculated (Figure 10).
Results show significant differences between countries, with rates varying from under 10 % (Slovakia) to about 50 % of opioid users (Italy).
However, the data does suggest the need to review the availability of treatment options in all countries in order to ensure that sufficient provision is available to meet estimated needs.
Despite some recent increases in substitution treatment in the Baltic States and central European countries, levels remain low compared to the estimated number of opioid users in these Member States, with the exception of Slovenia.
An estimate from Estonia suggests that only 5 % of heroin users in the four major urban centres are covered by substitution programmes, and that this rate is as low as 1 % at national level.
Opioid treatment demands
The vast majority of treated clients (97 %) are reported by the EU-15 Member States, who also contribute the majority (80 %) of all treatment demands reported in the TDI data set.
This represents a more than sevenfold increase since 1993, when substitution cases were estimated to be around 73 000 (Farrell, 1995).
Data show a rise of about 15 % in client numbers in the EU and Norway from 2003 to 2005, mostly due to increases in Germany (estimated increase of 8 300 cases), France (5 706), Italy (6 234), Portugal (4 168) and the United Kingdom (41 500) (129).
In 2005, stabilisation in the number of clients in substitution treatment was reported in the Netherlands (122 cases per 100 000 inhabitants) and Luxembourg (355 cases per 100 000).
The proportion of treatment demands that are for primary opioid use reflects, to some extent, the relative prevalence of illicit opioids as a problem drug requiring (further) treatment, although it is influenced by the organisation of the treatment services and the reporting system.
The proportion of clients seeking treatment for opioid use varies between countries.
Based on the most recent data available, opioid users make up 40–70 % of all treatment demands in 12 countries, less than 40 % in seven countries and more than 70 % in six countries (130
The percentage of all drug treatment demands accounted for by all heroin requests has fallen, decreasing from 74 % in 1999 to 61 % in 2005. The only countries not reporting a decrease are Bulgaria and the
United Kingdom (131).
The strongest relative growth during between 2003 and 2005 was observed in (but not confined to) some of the new Member States, with countries reporting substantial increases (over 40 %) including Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Lithuania, Romania and Norway.
These increases coincided with a geographical expansion of the availability of substitution treatment option in many of these countries.
Provision of substitution treatment did not increase in all new Member States: Hungary, Poland and Slovakia reported a relatively stable situation, while client numbers in the Latvian high-threshold methadone programme actually decreased from 67 to 50.
In two countries with a history of high levels of provision, Spain and Malta, provision has recently decreased, possibly reflecting overall levels of demand in these countries.
The interrelationship between repeat treatment demands, maintenance levels and the prevalence of problem opioid use is complex.
The levels of clients’ repeat treatment demands and the numbers of clients in drug maintenance programmes is determined by historical developments in opioid use incidence and prevalence, as well as treatment service organisation and type.
For a few countries, it
The absolute decrease of new opioids treatment demands, mainly due to heroin use, is confirmed by looking at the trend of new heroin clients: all the countries, except Bulgaria and Greece, report a decrease in the proportion of new requests for primary heroin use among new drug clients in the last seven years.
From 1999 to 2005, the percentage of new heroin clients among all new drug clients fell from 70 % to 37%. %.

See Figure TDI-3 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.

Most clients (60 %) report initiation of opioid use before the age of 20; first use of opioids after the age of 25 was very uncommon (133).
On average, a lag of 7–8 years was reported between first use of opioids and first contact with drug treatment: the mean age at onset of opioid use was 22 years and the mean age at first treatment demand 29–30 years.
Inpatient treatment demands were typically a little older than those receiving outpatient care, and the data suggest quite a short interval between first contact with treatment and subsequent treatment episodes.

Some countries report a high degree of co-occurrence of opioid dependence and other psychiatric disorders among opioid users. This observation has also been made in many clinical studies, which indicate that major depression, anxiety disorders, antisocial and borderline personality disorders are relatively common disorders among opioid users (Mateu et al., 2005).

Studies have compared the physiological and subjective effects of BZP with those of amphetamine, and suggest that BZP has approximately one tenth of the potency of dexamphetamine.
Emerging drugs trends often mimic, expand on, or substitute previously popular drug trends and raise questions about why psychoactive substances are being consumed.
Therefore, emerging trends in drug and alcohol consumption must be understood not only in relation to changes in policy by governments, but also in relation to each other and within the broader context of current fashions and sociocultural changes in leisure time pursuits.
In recent years, products containing BZP started to be aggressively marketed as a legal alternative to ecstasy by various retailers through the printed media, Internet sites, designated shops and stalls at clubs and festivals, and may be traded as ‘ecstasy’. BZP is offered in various combinations with other piperazines, and some, in particular
Developments in information technology and communication media, particularly the Internet, provide channels that facilitate the diffusion of new trends and allow the expression of diverse opinions about drug use and the associated risks.
BZP in combination with TFMPP (136
), are thought to be designed to mimic ecstasy’s effects.
These products usually are visibly labelled as piperazine-containing, but are often misrepresented as ‘natural’ or ‘herbal’.
New or changing patterns of drug use usually emerge at local, or city levels and very few Member States have, for example, monitoring systems to indicate the extent of fatal and non-fatal intoxications from the use of new or emerging psychoactive substances.
In the context of an inevitably partial picture, the accumulated information about emerging drug trends in Europe is assessed by triangulating information from a wide range of different sources.
The evidence accumulated in the EU about emerging trends in drug use suggests that they may parallel consumer trends in legal markets — for example the sale of entirely synthetic substances such as BZP, with the claim that it is ‘natural’ or ‘herbal’, may be appealing to a wider consumer interest in natural products.
Furthermore, perceived safety of BZP is fostered by the fact that the products are often sold by designated retailers or in specialised shops rather than on the street.
This chapter reports on recent developments in the illicit use of psychoactive substances that are not routinely addressed by the key drug indicators and have only recently been identified as a potential concern by policymakers or have attracted attention from the mass media.
Piperazines: new psychoactive substances
BZP has been encountered in 14 EU Member States (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom) and Norway.
The most significant development relating to new psychoactive substances in recent years is the spread of various novel piperazine derivatives, a number of which appeared in Europe between 2004 and 2006.
There is some evidence about health risks related to BZP, which appears to have a narrow safety margin when used recreationally.
There are, though, no fatal cases that can be directly attributed to BZP. In March 2007, the EU responded to rising concern over the use of BZP by
This group of synthetic substances is derived from the parent compound piperazine and includes BZP (1-benzylpiperazine) and mCPP (1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine).
These two substances are largely available from chemical suppliers and on the Internet, and illicit production is mainly limited to producing tablets or capsules.
mCPP their legislation addressing psychotropic substances.
GHB has been used therapeutically in anaesthesia in France and Germany, and in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in Austria and Italy.
In June 2005, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of EMEA recommended granting a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Xyrem (GHB being the active substance) for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy (EMEA, 2005) (139).
mCPP has been described as producing stimulant and hallucinogenic effects similar to those of ecstasy (MDMA). Tablets containing mCPP are often designed to look like ecstasy and are almost always traded as such and the drugs are sometimes found in combination.
It might be assumed that the addition of mCPP is intended to potentiate or ameliorate the effects of MDMA.
Since 2004, mCPP has been found in 26 Member States (all but Cyprus) and Norway; as such, it is becoming the most widely encountered new psychotropic substance in the EU ever since the European early-warning system monitoring began in 1997.
GHB is easily manufactured from its precursors gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD), solvents widely used in industry and commercially available.
Some countries, recognising the potential for misuse of these precursor substances have chosen to control one or both of them under drug control or equivalent legislation (Italy, Latvia, Sweden).
Because GBL is not controlled in most Member States and online chemical suppliers offering it provide an easy access, some GHB users appear to have switched to consuming GBL.
Qualitative analyses of online GHB and drug forums based in the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands suggest that users obtain GBL from chemical suppliers who market GBL for various legitimate purposes.
Open Internet sales of GHB (138
Drug facilitated sexual assault
All information sources available suggest that general prevalence of GHB use is low, with significant levels of use limited to some specific subpopulations.
An Internet survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that GHB was more commonly used within the home (67 %) compared with nightlife environments (26 %) (Sumnall et al., 2007).
A survey of 408 pub-goers in Amsterdam in 2005 reported lifetime prevalence estimates for GHB which were significantly higher among the clientele of gay bars and trendy cafes (17.5% and 19 % respectively) than in mainstream and student pubs and cafes (5.7% and 2.7% respectively) (Nabben et al., 2006).
Cases of sexual assault by means of covertly adding a drug to a drink in order to incapacitate a victim have been increasingly reported in the media and medical literature since the 1980s.
However, forensic evidence for this type of crime is notoriously difficult to obtain.
Forensic studies do reveal that high concentrations of alcohol and also prescription benzodiazepine drugs are commonly identified in cases of alleged sexual assault (in over 80 % of French cases and 30 % of United Kingdom cases), but the narrow window of detection for drugs such as GHB is a limitation in establishing evidence in cases of alleged offences that are not quickly reported.
The forensic evidence that is available from studies conducted since 2000 (in the United Kingdom, France, United States and Australia) indicate that covert administration of drugs for the purpose of sexual assault appears uncommon, although true incidence may be higher than identified due to non- or delayed reporting.
A lack of information makes trends in GHB use difficult to assess, although the available evidence suggests that use of GHB remains limited to some small subpopulation groups.
Data from dance music surveys from Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom suggest that use of GHB may have peaked around 2000–03 and declined subsequently.
However, the extent to which this finding would apply to other subgroups is unclear.
) See http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/?nnodeid=1346) The term GHB is used to include the possible use of GBL or 1,4-BD.)
Internet as a source of information on emerging drug trends hallucinogenic mushrooms (70 cases), ecstasy (63 cases), amphetamine (three cases) and LSD (one case).
Compared with other substances, a high proportion of GHB cases (84 %) required transportation to a hospital.
GHB information requests to the National Poisons Information Centre in the Netherlands increased by 27 % (constituting 241 of the 1 383 requests made) in 2005 compared with 2004.
In 2004, over a third of young people in the EU stated that they would turn to the Internet if they wanted to know more about drugs (Eurobarometer, 2004).
If young people do go online seeking drug information, a real question arises as to the extent to which the information they access will be unbiased and accurate.
Numerous sites cover drug use issues, some of them government-sponsored, others run by lobby groups, consumer or advocacy networks.
In addition to acting as a source of information on drugs, the Internet has created a marketplace for both licit and illicit drugs, with sites offering for sale illicit drugs and legal alternatives.
Online drug retailers increasingly have the potential to spread new drug-taking practices or products by exploiting the marketing potential of the Internet by using online marketing strategies that are very responsive to users’ demands and to changing legal and market situations.
Responses to the use of GHB are most commonly provided by national or community projects targeting nightlife settings, and usually consist of training club staff and disseminating information about the risks of using GHB (Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, the United Kingdom).
Advice on precautions to be taken in nightlife settings to avoid having drinks ‘spiked’ and measures to be taken in the case of a potential overdose are central in information disseminated about GHB.
Teams that provide first aid support for drug and alcohol problems are increasingly deployed at large events to respond to incidents involving GHB or other drug-related.
Within the framework of the E-POD (European perspectives on drugs) project, the EMCDDA is exploring ways to use the Internet as a source of information on emerging drug trends.
At the EU level there are also developments to provide reliable information on public health matters: the new EU public health portal provides a gateway into a range of European public health resources including drug-related information (1
) http://ec.europa.eu/health-eu that in 2005, drug telephone helplines in Finland reported telephone calls about GBL for the first time (FESAT, 2005).
Health risks
Ketamine has been monitored in the EU since concerns first arose in 2000 about its misuse (EMCDDA, 2002).
At national level, ketamine is subject to controlled drugs legislation (as opposed to medicine regulations) in almost half of the EU Member States, and in Sweden and the United Kingdom, ketamine was listed as a narcotic substance in 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Following this review, in March 2007, the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs draft resolution on responding to the
New psychoactive substances
The main health risk associated with the use of GHB appears to be the high risk of loss of consciousness, especially when the drug is combined with alcohol or other sedative drugs.
GHB use can also result in other problems including coma, decrease in body temperature, hypotonia, hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia and respiratory depression.
Physical dependence to GHB has been observed following prolonged use, and additional health risks may be posed due to the possible presence of solvents or heavy metal contaminants.
Council Decision 2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances establishes a mechanism for the rapid exchange of information on new psychoactive substances that may pose public health and social threats.
The EMCDDA and Europol, in close collaboration with their networks — the Reitox national focal points and Europol national units respectively — are assigned a central role in implementing an early-warning system for detection of new psychoactive substances (1).
In Amsterdam, the reported number of non-fatal emergencies due to the use of GHB was 76 in 2005, exceeding, as in previous years, the medical emergencies attributed to use of
reported lifetime prevalence rates at less than 0.5%.
Some data is also available from surveys carried out in dance music settings, and among the different studies on this high-risk population, rates of ever in lifetime use of ketamine were reported to range from 7 % in a Czech study to 21 % in a Hungarian sample.
Drug-related infectious diseases identified may be influenced by differences in testing and reporting rates between countries or over time.
Data provided to the EMCDDA and the European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS (EuroHIV, 2006) suggest that, by the end of 2005, the transmission of HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs) was low in most countries of the European Union.
This may at least partly follow from the increased availability of prevention, treatment and harm-reduction measures including substitution treatment and needle and syringe programmes, although other factors, such as the declines in injecting drug use observed in several countries, may also have played an important role.
In several EU countries and regions, however, it is likely that IDU-related HIV transmission still continued at relatively high rates in 2005 (140), underlining the need to ensure the coverage and effectiveness of local prevention practice.
Surveillance of drug-related infectious diseases among IDUs in Europe is currently focused on HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis (B and C).
It consists of two complementary systems, case reporting (or ‘notifications’: absolute counts of newly reported/notified cases) and ‘seroprevalence monitoring’ (or ‘sentinel surveillance’: percentage testing positive in samples of IDUs) (Figure 11) (141
However, while the data provided by either of these two systems should be interpreted with caution, taken together, they provide a more complete picture of recent epidemiological trends.
The available data suggests that, by 2005, in most countries, rates of new infection related to IDUs were low.
A caveat to this analysis is that in several high-prevalence countries, recent case reporting data is not available (Estonia, Spain, Italy, Austria).
In 19 Member States, most of which have never experienced large HIV epidemics among IDUs, rates of reported IDU-related cases remained under five cases per million population in 2005.
Higher figures were reported by Ireland and Luxembourg, with 16 and 15 new cases per million respectively.
In Portugal, which reported the highest rate among the countries where IDU-specific data are available (85 new cases per million of the general population in 2005), the current situation appears to have stabilised after a decline between 2000 and 2003 (142).
In Latvia, Lithuania and probably also in Estonia, rates of reported new IDU-related infections have strongly declined since the epidemic peaks in 2001–02, although they are still high in comparison with most other countries.
In Latvia, the rate has dropped from 283 new cases per million in 2001 to 49 per million in 2005.
In Lithuania, after an outbreak among prisoners, a peak observed in 2002 (109 per million) has been followed by a decrease to 25 new cases per million in 2005.
Although there has been a strong decline in HIV infection in Estonia, the country still reports the highest rate of new HIV infections in the EU.
And, while IDU-specific data are not available for Estonia, drug injecting is likely to remain a major transmission route for HIV in this country.
HIV prevalence among young and new IDUs
An important indicator of the number (incidence) of new infections among injecting drug users is provided by case reports of newly diagnosed HIV infections.
In interpreting this data, a number of considerations should be borne in mind: infected IDUs may not be diagnosed if they are not in contact with health services; new infections may not necessarily be attributed to drug injection; and, the number of cases
Support for the conclusions drawn from the available case reporting data can be found by analysing levels of HIV infection in samples of new IDUs (those injecting less than two years) and young IDUs (those under age 25).

(national increase) and Lithuania (increase in one city), but also Austria (national increase), the United Kingdom (increase in England and Wales, but still at a low level) as well as some countries where prevalence is still very low (less than 1 %).
Overall, these local or national level increases in HIV prevalence suggest that complacency concerning the provision of prevention measures to IDUs should be avoided.
in mind that the size of these subsamples is, in general, small and that HIV seroprevalence data on young and new IDUs is not available from some countries.
Trends in HIV prevalence
Increasing HIV prevalences in repeated samples of IDUs may also indicate ongoing infections — although declines in mortality of infected IDUs or decreasing numbers of uninfected IDUs can be important confounders.
Most available time series for the EU show stable prevalence, suggesting that the numbers of infected IDUs dying are balanced by the numbers of IDUs contracting HIV infection.
Overall, among the more than 90 time series of repeated HIV prevalence measurements in IDU samples covering 22 EU Member States plus Norway in 2001–05, more regions show a declining than an increasing trend. The

Only five countries reported studies where prevalence was less than 25%. %.
The number of newly diagnosed cases of HIV among injecting drug users is estimated to be currently around 3 500 per annum in the EU.
AIDS incidence and access to HAART
The prevalence of markers for HBV infection varies to a greater extent than that of HCV markers, possibly due to differences in vaccination levels.
The most complete data set available is that for the antibody to the hepatitis core antigen (anti-HBc), which indicates a history of infection.
In 2004–05, prevalence rates of over 40 % were reported from six countries.
reporting at least 75 % coverage (145
), although specific data for IDUs are not available. AIDS incidence data remains important as it indicates the level of symptomatic disease and the introduction and availability of HAART.
Time trends in notified cases of hepatitis B and C show different pictures.
In the case of hepatitis B, the proportion of IDUs among all notified cases appears generally to have declined, possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vaccination programmes. No general trend is visible for the proportion of IDUs among notified cases of hepatitis
C infection (150); however, this proportion differs strongly between countries, suggesting that differences exist in the transmission of hepatitis C. Understanding the factors that are responsible for inter-country differences in infection rates is likely to be important for the design of better prevention and harm-reduction strategies in this area.
Preventing infectious diseases
Portugal remains the country with the highest incidence of IDU-related AIDS and it is the only country recording a recent increase, with an estimated 36 new cases per million population in 2005, up from 30 cases per million in 2004.
In addition, total AIDS mortality (most likely largely related to injecting drug use) has not declined between 1997 and 2002, suggesting that access to HAART may have been low during this period (146).
Of the Baltic countries, Latvia records a decrease in AIDS incidence, at 23 new cases per million in 2005, down from a peak of 26 new cases per million in 2004, while Estonia has not provided IDU-specific data in 2005 but reported an increase between 2003 and

To address the problem of undiagnosed HIV infection, new guidance has been published this year (WHO/UNAIDS, 2007). A more proactive approach of healthcare providers to recommending HIV testing and counselling, especially at facilities targeting most-at-risk populations, such as injecting drug users, is suggested in order to achieve increased voluntary uptake of HIV testing.
A message emerging from the work of the EMCDDA on this topic is that regular voluntary medical examination, including testing and counselling for HIV and other infections, is a particularly appropriate service to offer to injecting drug users.
Among the greatest challenges in public health in the last two decades are: the resurgence of communicable diseases such as TB; the rise and rapid spread of HIV/AIDS; and the seemingly uncontrollable pandemic of problematic use of psychotropic drugs.
The most vulnerable sections of the population suffer disproportionately from these conditions.
Among prison populations, in particular, drug problems are often common and levels of infectious diseases relatively high.
Moreover, drug use often continues or, sometimes, is initiated in prison; and in this setting, high-risk behaviours can be common.
Prisons, therefore, have the potential to lead to elevated levels of infection of potential life-threatening diseases but may also provide an opportunity to intervene with a particularly important target group.
For the prevention of hepatitis A and B, vaccination has an important role to play.
Some countries provide vaccination for hepatitis B at the population level, while others target those considered to be at particular risk.
In Norway, hepatitis A and B vaccinations were stepped up after epidemic outbreaks of these liver infections showed that injecting drug use had spread to smaller municipalities.
With a few exceptions (France, the United Kingdom (England and Wales), Norway) prison health is generally an integral part of the judicial or security system rather than of the health system, thus risking isolating health in prisons from mainstream public health approaches and raising questions about the independence, quality, accessibility and level of health services provided.
The high prevalence of hepatitis C infection among injectors points strongly for the need to develop more effective responses to this disease, for which vaccination is not an option.
A number of countries have specific programmes aimed at hepatitis C prevention and some interesting work is developing in this area, for example the ‘stop hepC’ campaign, which has run in Oslo since 2003, aims at reaching drug users before they have started injecting or while they are still new to the practice.
The poor health status of prisoners can have implications for wider public health, when drug users are released and resume contact with their family and others in the community.
Therefore, the detection of serious communicable diseases such as HIV infection and tuberculosis, accompanied by adequate treatment and harm-reduction measures can contribute significantly to the health status of the communities from which the prisoners come and to which they will return.
For those who are drug-dependent, treatment programmes in prison can provide an opportunity that may benefit not only the individual’s health, but may also reduce the likelihood of future offending.
In order to increase our knowledge of the prison health situation and of the specific responses, the public health programme of the European Commission supports the Health in Prisons Project, World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe, to establish a database for the collection of relevant prison health indicators and other health determinants.
The EMCDDA is involved in the joint development of the database together with WHO Europe and the European Network on Drugs and Infections Prevention in Prison (Endipp) (1).
Drug treatment and harm-reduction services also need to develop responses to the risks posed by the sexual behaviour of their clients.
In addition to drug injecting, drug users may also be exposed to an elevated risk of HIV infection due to their sexual behaviour — either because of impaired decision- making, the association of some drugs with high-risk sexual behaviours, or through their involvement in sex work or sex for drug exchanges. Women drug users may be particularly vulnerable, though concerns also exist about the interaction between drug use and high-risk sexual behaviour among some groups of men who have sex with men.
The integration of needle and syringe exchange or distribution schemes within services provided by drugs agencies and the combined offer of risk counselling and advice services, as well as of referral of drug users to treatment are common in the EU. Needle and syringe
Currently, work to motivate pharmacists to get involved in syringe programmes and to support those who are is only reported by France, Portugal and the United Kingdom.
programmes (NSPs) were identified as a priority measure for addressing the spread of infectious disease among drug injectors in three out of four EU countries and Norway (151).
Provision of clean needles and syringes is reported by all countries except Cyprus, where this measure has, in 2006, been recommended by an expert group to curb a possible increase in injecting-related infections.
The distribution of other sterile equipment such as alcohol pads and dry wipes, water, filters and cookers together with clean syringes is becoming a general approach among service providers.
While the distribution of sterile injecting material through NSPs is generally no longer regarded as a controversial issue, not all countries prioritise these programmes, and some consider pharmacy sales as largely sufficient.
The geographic coverage of NSPs and the provision of injecting material through them vary greatly between countries.
However, a growing number of countries have nationwide networks of NSPs.
Countries reporting good national coverage of NSPs include: Luxembourg and Malta, two small countries; Italy, where NSPs are commonly or often implemented in about 70 % of all local health districts; the Czech Republic, where they are available in all 77 districts and in the capital city of Prague; and Finland, where legislation obliges municipalities to provide relevant services to prevent infectious diseases, including NSPs.
Portugal estimates that its pharmacy-based and outreach NSPs cover about 50 % of the territory, and in Denmark, 10 of the 13 counties run NSPs.
All Austrian cities with a significant injecting drug scene have at least one needle and syringe outlet, and in Bulgaria, services are available in 10 cities with relatively high levels of problem drug use.
In Estonia, it was estimated in 2005 that 37 % of IDUs were in contact with NSPs, while the coverage of the target groups in Slovakia and Romania was estimated to be considerably lower (20 % and 10–15 %, respectively).
The nature and range of provision of sterile injecting material vary between countries.
In general, syringe provision outlets are located in specialised drugs agencies, and in all but three countries this type of provision is complemented by mobile services that can reach out to groups of drug injectors in marginalised neighbourhoods.
Syringe vending machines complement the available NSP services in 10 countries (152), but data on turnover are scarce and research about the effectiveness of this type of provision is lacking.
Luxembourg has now joined Spain and Germany among the few countries offering needle and syringe exchange in prisons; although provision in Germany is limited to one prison in Berlin.
Between 2003 and 2005, increases in the total number of syringes exchanged or distributed through specialised NSPs were reported by several countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia,
The widespread availability of community-based pharmacies means that syringe exchange schemes operated through pharmacies can considerably improve the geographical availability of syringes and, therefore, complement provision by specialist agencies. For example, in Scotland, 1.7 million syringes were distributed through a network of 116 participating pharmacies in 2004, and in Portugal more than 1 300 pharmacies took part in the scheme and distributed 1.4 million syringes (153).
Specialised agencies that provide needle and syringe programmes can have other important public health roles, for example, assessing and raising the awareness for risk behaviour among clients, motivating them to get tested and vaccinated, as well as providing a conduit to primary healthcare and drug treatment.
This audit report found that levels of awareness of infectious diseases among clients were relatively low, and that agencies could be more proactive in offering counselling, testing and vaccination.

Drug-related deaths
The EMCDDA definition of drug-related deaths refers to those that are caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs.
1 400 deaths in 2003 (EuroHIV, 2006) (159), although this is possibly an underestimate.
The number of deaths from other causes indirectly related to drug use (e.g. hepatitis, violence, suicide or accidents) is more difficult to assess.
It has been estimated that, in at least some European cities, 10–20 % of mortality among young adults could be attributed to opioid use, directly or indirectly (Bargagli et al., 2006) (see below).
Mortality related to other forms of drug use (e.g. cocaine) would add to this figure, but is more difficult to quantify.
‘drug-induced deaths’ and ‘acute drug deaths’ (155).
The number of drug-related deaths in a community will depend on the number of people using drugs associated with overdose (particularly opioids).
Other factors that will also be important include: the proportion of injectors, prevalence of polydrug use, availability and policy of treatment services and emergency services.
Determining the overall level of mortality resulting from problem drug use at a national or European level will require advances in data collection and analysis.
An attempt at such an exercise on a national scale is reported in the Dutch national report.
By extrapolating data from a local study, the mortality rate due, directly and indirectly, to problem drug use was estimated, taking into account regional differences.
Although further methodological work is needed, this type of study, in addition to measuring the extent of deaths indirectly related to drug use, has the potential to overcome possible under-reporting of overdose deaths.
Acute deaths related to opioids
Heroin deaths (160
Although the comparability of European data has improved in recent years, differences in the quality of reporting between countries still mean that direct comparisons should be made with caution.
The extent of drug-related deaths can be expressed in terms of the number of cases reported, by population rates or by proportional mortality.
These figures should be considered as a minimum estimate (156
Opioids are present in most cases of acute drug-related deaths due to illegal substances reported in the EU, accounting for 46 % to 100 % (Figure 12), mainly heroin or its metabolites.
In Europe, most opioid deaths are related to heroin, but often other substances are also identified as having possibly played a role, in particular alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other opioids and, in some countries, cocaine.
A voluntary data collection on substances involved in drug deaths in which nine countries participated in 2006 (161) has confirmed that in opioid overdoses, more than one drug is usually mentioned (60–90% of cases) and they could be considered ‘polydrug deaths’.
In addition to overdoses, drug users die from causes indirectly related to drug use. For instance, AIDS deaths related to injecting drug use accounted for almost

Note that figure refers to the west and centre area of WHO Europe, which includes some non-EU countries, and the total deaths for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (east area).)
As most cases reported to the EMCDDA are opioid overdoses, general characteristics of acute drug-related deaths are used for description of opioid cases.)

Methadone and buprenorphine deaths with the mean age in most countries in the mid-30s (162
Although research shows that substitution treatment reduces the risk of fatal overdose, each year some deaths are reported associated with the misuse of substitution medicines.
Monitoring the number of deaths related to methadone and to buprenorphine and the circumstances surrounding the deaths can provide important information for the quality assurance of substitution programmes and to inform prevention and harm-reduction initiatives.
mean age at overdose death is lowest in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, and Romania and highest in Poland, Finland and the United Kingdom.
There are very few reported overdose deaths among people aged less than 15 years, although drug deaths in this age group could be under-reported.
While some drug-related deaths are recorded among those aged over 65 years, only seven countries report more than 5 % of cases in this age group.
In several of the Member States that joined the EU since 2004, the comparatively low mean age at death and the high proportion of fatal overdoses among those aged less than 25 years may signal a younger heroin-using population in these countries (163).
In many Member States, the age of overdose fatalities is increasing, suggesting a decrease in the incidence of heroin use among young people.
This trend is common among the EU-15 Member States, although in Austria and Luxembourg decreases have been observed in recent years.
In the other Member States, the trend is less clear, and the small numbers of cases makes it difficult to interpret the figures (164).
) See Table DRD-1 (part i) in the 2007 statistical bulletin.)
See Figures DRD-3 and DRD-4 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.
Deaths related to cocaine
(2004); and, in Norway, 55 autopsies revealed traces of methadone.
Spain reported (Reitox national reports, 2005) that there were few fatal overdoses involving only methadone (2 % of total), but that it was frequently present in combination in opioid deaths (42 %) and cocaine deaths (20 %).
Other countries did not report methadone deaths or the numbers were very small.
Overdose deaths due to cocaine are more difficult to identify than those caused by opioids, and are often considered to be the result of a combination of causes, rather than from cocaine toxicity itself (166).
Studies have found that most cocaine deaths are related to chronic use of the drug and are often the result of cardiovascular and neurological problems brought on by the use of cocaine over a long time, particularly in users with predisposing conditions or risk factors.
In Europe, reports of deaths with cocaine involved usually also mention the presence of other substances (including alcohol and opioids), reflecting the use of cocaine in combination with other drugs.
Among the countries supplying data, over 400 cocaine deaths were identified in both the 2006 and 2005 national reports.
There is a clear need to investigate further the health consequences and mortality related to cocaine use.
Trends in acute drug-related deaths
Deaths due to buprenorphine poisoning appear to be rare, which is attributed to the agonist–antagonist pharmacological characteristics of this drug.
However, some deaths have been reported by European countries.
In the 2006 and 2005 national reports, only France and Finland recorded deaths related to this substance.
In Finland, buprenorphine was found in 83 cases in 2005 (73 in 2004), generally combined with benzodiazepines, sedatives or alcohol, or injected.
In France, only two fatal overdoses involving buprenorphine were reported in 2005 (four in 2004).
Buprenorphine is the main opioid substitution drug in these two countries, but the estimated 70 000 to 85 000 people receiving the substance in France is much greater than the numbers treated in Finland.
In addition to France and Finland, in 2004, three other countries reported deaths mentioning buprenorphine (two or three in each case).
A study searching exhaustively for deaths with mentions of buprenorphine in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 2002 found only 43 cases, often in combination with benzodiazepines or other opioids (Schifano et al., 2005).
National trends in drug-related deaths can provide insights both into developments in patterns of problematic drug use in each country and into developments in responses.
Data available for the EU reveal some general trends in drug-related deaths.
From a longer term perspective, the EU-15 Member States and Norway experienced a sharp increase in drug-related deaths during the 1980s and early 1990s, possibly paralleling the expansion of heroin use and injection (167).
Drug deaths continued to increase between 1990 and 2000, although less sharply.

See Table DRD-2 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.

Gender differences are also observable in trends in

in the Netherlands, Austria and the United Kingdom.
Several possible causes have been
Research studies among opioid users in various European settings have found that mortality among this group is high compared to that of the general population.
A collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project found that opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their peers of the same age (see EMCDDA, 2006).
A French cohort study that followed individuals arrested for heroin, cocaine or crack use found that male mortality was five times higher and female mortality 9.5 times than in the general population, but with a decreasing trend (Reitox national reports, 2005).
suggested to account for this recent increase, among which are polydrug use by opioid users, or a possible increase in the availability of heroin.
Recent studies from the Netherlands and Norway did not find any relationship between age and risk of overdose death (Cruts et al., in press; Ødegård et al., 2006 cited in the Norwegian national report), however, as opioid users age, mortality due to chronic conditions may add progressively to mortality due to external causes such as suicide and violence. Poor living conditions of drug users as well as their mental health problems may also contribute substantially to the high mortality of this group.
There is a marked discrepancy in trends in drug-related deaths between the EU-15 Member States and those who have joined since 2004.
Among the EU-15 Member States, there has been an overall decrease since 1996, very marked between 2000 and 2002, suggesting a long-term decrease in the number of young opioid injectors.
However, recent trends in these countries are mixed.
In the new Member States, a sharp increase was observed until 2002, but decreasing in 2003–04.
Increases in the proportion of drug-related deaths in drug users aged under 30 years have been observed in Greece and among those aged under 25 years in Estonia, Luxembourg and Austria, and to a lesser extent in Latvia and
Suicide is identified as a cause of drug overdose deaths in some studies among drug users.
Known suicides, added together with undetermined intent deaths constituted 30 % of all drug-related deaths reported in Scotland in 2005.
In 2003, 13 % of all drug-related deaths were suicides

Co-morbidity and Isadora project
(Scottish Executive, 2005). Substance misuse problems are thought to contribute to suicidal behaviour in several ways: common risk factors, substance misuse among people prone to high-risk behaviours.
The attention given to overdose prevention measures has grown in recognition of the relative importance of drug overdose as a public health issue. While engagement with treatment and other services may reduce drug-related deaths, there remains considerable potential for developing interventions targeted specifically on overdose risks, and overall, Europe still lacks a comprehensive approach to overdose prevention.
Psychiatric disorders are commonly related to problematic drug use.
Although no systematic collection of information on co-morbidity exists at European level, findings from local research conducted in several European countries suggest that between 30 % and 90 % of clients in drug treatment may have co-morbid psychiatric conditions.
The most common disorders diagnosed among those dependent on drugs include personality disorders, depression, antisocial personality, anxiety, and mood and eating disorders.
Schizophrenia and suicidal tendencies are also mentioned.
Co-morbidity is reported to be more common among heroin users, especially those who have a long history of drug use and who have experienced several interruptions in methadone treatment and whose social and living conditions have deteriorated.
Similarly, drug dependence is common among people with serious mental illness.
The European project Isadora (‘integrated services aimed at dual diagnosis and optimal recovery from addiction’) was concluded in 2005 after a three-year research period (1).
Member States, especially those with older heroin epidemics, have increasingly stepped up their availability of drug treatment over the past years and are now reaching an increasing number of hard-to-reach problem drug users (see also Chapter 2 and Chapter 6).
Easier accessibility of treatment and greater variety of approaches, including substitution treatment, improve rates of retention in treatment, which makes an important contribution to reducing drug-related deaths and mortality.
Several countries have lowered accessibility thresholds to drug maintenance treatment, and changes in philosophy towards expediting entry and re-enrolling in methadone maintenance treatment (measures which have been shown to increase survival) are evident.
Furthermore, studies from high-threshold programmes, suggest that strict admission criteria and treatment rules lead to more disciplinary discharges, increasing the risk of death to those discharged, compared to those remaining in treatment (Fugelstad et al., 2007).
A longitudinal study on the effectiveness of treatments for heroin addiction, which will examine the association between retention in treatment and mortality, is currently underway in Italy (Bargagli et al., 2006).
In the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from opioid drugs are at an elevated risk of an overdose, if they relapse back into drug use — as their previous tolerance will be reduced.
It is, therefore, an important harm-reduction measure to inform those leaving such settings of the risks that resuming drug use can pose and discuss with them risk reduction strategies.
Continuity of care with social support and treatment services can play an import role here, especially for those leaving prison.
Research suggests that concurrent use of other drugs, particularly alcohol and sedative drugs, may increase the risk of fatal opioid overdose and, therefore, polydrug use is an important issue for services to address.
Some experimental work has looked at the possibility of providing drug users with opioid antagonists, an example being a Scottish pilot scheme to distribute Naloxone to drug users, their families and friends.
This approach has not been widely developed in Europe to date, but may have potential.
The availability of opioid antagonists in ambulances, treatment facilities or other settings where opioid drug overdose is likely to be encountered is a more common approach, though not universal.
Given the effectiveness of these drugs, if quickly administered, a need clearly exists to review the availability of this sort of response within any review of overdose prevention measures.
Other overdose prevention approaches include teaching drug users the recovery position and how to respond better to emergency situations, as well as working with the police, ambulance service and drug users themselves to encourage the calling of emergency medical services at an early stage
An approach that has generated some controversy is the provision of drug consumption rooms, whereby drug users may consume their drugs in a designated space where
Drug consumption rooms have been criticised by the INCB in their recent annual reports, but are viewed by some EU Member States as a useful component of their responses to some forms of highly problematic drug use.
The arguments made in favour of drug consumption rooms include that they can provide an overdose prevention measure, reduce other risks associated with injecting, provide an opportunity for disseminating information and act as a conduit to primary healthcare, treatment and other drug services.
Consumption rooms are sometimes also viewed as an opportunity to limit public nuisance caused by the use of drugs.
There are now in excess of 70 consumption rooms in the EU and Norway: about 40 in the Netherlands, 25 in Germany, six in Spain and one each in Luxembourg and Norway.
Information, education and communication (IEC) techniques are used throughout Europe in initiatives that aim to reduce drug-related deaths.
Several countries report that specifically developed information materials are distributed among drug users, their peers and families, or police.
However, besides first aid courses for staff at drugs agencies or for drug users themselves, overdose risk assessment and counselling about risk management seems to be becoming more common in Europe and is mentioned, for example, in the reports from Romania, the Netherlands and Malta.
In 2005, an action plan to reduce drug-related deaths was launched in Scotland, and consists of an overdose awareness DVD, new research to look at the delays in calling for help and a national forum to look at trends and identify areas where further action needs to be taken.

One has only to consider the worrying developments resulting from the transiting of cocaine through West Africa to be reminded of the collateral damage that this problem can cause.
We are proud to present this, the thirteenth, annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.
This report is only possible through the hard work and dedication of our partners in the Reitox network of national focal points and the experts throughout Europe who have contributed to the analysis.
We also are indebted to those EU agencies and international organisations working in the drugs field.
Our report is a collective endeavour and we thank all those who have contributed to it.
The rationale behind this work is that a cool-headed analysis of what we know about the drug situation is a condition for an informed, productive and reasoned debate.
It ensures that opinions are enlightened by facts, and that those making difficult policy choices can have a clear understanding of the costs and benefits of the options available.
On a positive note, drug use in Europe appears to be stabilising, and progress can be noted in the way in which EU Member States are addressing this issue.
For most forms of drug use, our overall assessment is that we are not seeing increases, and in some areas the trends appear to be downward.
In terms of responses, we have seen virtually all Member States adopt a strategic approach, and greater cohesion is visible at the European level.
Treatment availability continues to grow, and in some countries it has reached the point where the majority of heroin users, once considered a hidden population, are now in contact with services of one sort or another.
Not many years ago, HIV infection among drug injectors was a central concern in the drugpolicy debate.
Since then, a pragmatic mixture of prevention, treatment and harmreduction measures has become the norm in Europe, and rates of new infection attributed to drug use have fallen and continue to do so.
This year has been an exceptionally busy time for drug policy, and the EMCDDA has been honoured to have supported both the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs and the review of the 1998 United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the drug problem.
It is gratifying to note that, by international standards, Europe stands out as one of the parts of the world where monitoring capacities are most developed.
Nonetheless, we are aware of the limitations of our current information resources, and are constantly working with our partners to improve the quality and relevance of the data available.
Good news makes poor headlines and can be overlooked.
However, it is important to recognise progress where it has been made.
Increasingly, in Europe, we have an understanding of what measures can be effective in addressing drug problems.
An acceptance that our activities can, and do, make a difference is a prerequisite to securing investment and policy support.
This is not to say that our report does not highlight many areas of concern for the European Union.
Examples include the continuing increases in cocaine use and the considerable differences that still exist between countries in the availability and quality of services for those with problems.
We must therefore conclude that, even if progress has been made, the journey remains far from finished.
However, today in Europe, more than at any time in the past, we have a stronger agreement on the direction we should take.
Marcel Reimen Chairman, EMCDDA Management Board
An underlying theme of the policy debate on drugs is the costs, both hidden and more visible, of Europe’s drug problem.
This issue is addressed in various parts of this report.
The EMCDDA has been working to develop an understanding of the public expenditures associated with tackling drug use in EU Member States.
This work is in its infancy, and estimates derived are indicative rather than precise.
Nonetheless, they point to considerable sums being spent, with preliminary figures of between EUR 28 billion and EUR 40 billion.
Less easy to express in economic terms is the harm caused by drug use.
What costs do we count in looking at the tragic loss of life caused by drugs in Europe, the negative impact on communities where drugs are produced or sold, or in the way that drug trafficking undermines the social
The EMCDDA would like to thank the following for their help in producing this report:
• the heads of the Reitox national focal points and their staff;
• the services within each Member State that collected the raw data for this report;
• the members of the Management Board and the Scientific Committee of the EMCDDA;
• the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union — in particular its Horizontal Working Party on Drugs — and the European Commission;
• the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and Europol;
• the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the WHO Regional Office for Europe, Interpol, the World Customs Organisation, the ESPAD project and the Swedish Council for Information on Alcohol and other Drugs (CAN), and the European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS (EuroHIV);
• the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union and the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities.
Reitox is the European information network on drugs and drug addiction.
The network is comprised of national focal points in the EU Member States, Norway, the candidate countries and at the European Commission.
Under the responsibility of their governments, the focal points are the national authorities providing drug information to the EMCDDA.
The contact details of the national focal points may be found at: http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/about/partners/reitox-network
This annual report is based on information provided to the EMCDDA by the EU Member States and candidate countries and Norway (participating in the work of the EMCDDA since 2001) in the form of a national report.
The statistical data reported here relate to the year 2006 (or the last year available).
Graphics and tables in this report may reflect a subset of EU countries: the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest.
Retail prices of drugs reported to the EMCDDA reflect the price to the user.
Reports on purity or potency, from most countries, are based on a sample of all drugs seized, and it is generally not possible to relate the reported data to a specific level of the drug market.
For purity or potency and retail prices, all analyses are based on typical (modal) values or, in their absence, mean (or median) values.
Reports of the prevalence of drug use based on general population surveys mostly refer to the national population aged 15–64 years.
Countries using different upper or lower age limits include: Bulgaria (18–60), the CzechRepublic (18), Denmark (16), Germany (18), Hungary (18–59), Malta (18), Sweden (16) and the UnitedKingdom (16–59).
In reports on treatment demand, ‘new clients’ refers to those who have entered treatment for the first time in their lives and ‘all clients’ refers to all those entering treatment.
Clients in continuous treatment at the start of the year in question are not included in the data.
Where the proportion of treatment demands for a primary drug is given, the denominator is the number of cases for which the primary drug is known.
Analysis of trends is based only on those countries providing sufficient data to describe changes over the time period in question.
Figures for 2005 may substitute for missing 2006 values in trend analysis of drug market data; for the analysis of other trends, missing data may be interpolated.
Trends in price are adjusted for inflation at national level.
The term ‘reports’ for drug law offences may describe different concepts in different countries.
Further information on the data and analytical methods is available in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
The annual report is available for downloading in 23 languages (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/annualreport/2008).
The 2008 statistical bulletin (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/stats08) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based.
It also provides further detail on the methodology used and about 100 additional statistical graphs.
Country overviews (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/country-overviews) provide a summary of key aspects of the drug situation for each country.
The national reports of the Reitox focal points give a detailed description and analysis of the drugs problem in each country and are available on the EMCDDA website (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/national-reports).
Commentary The drug situation in Europe — new perspectives and some old realities
A strong voice from Europe in an important year for reflection and policy formation the user is often difficult, and Member States vary greatly in how they have drawn the line between these two categories.
The idea that European countries are now making less use of criminal sanctions for drug use is not borne out by the available data.
During the past five years, the number of reported drug law offences has increased in Europe.
Most of the reported drug law offences are related to use and possession for use rather than supply, and whereas offences related to supply have increased by 12%, those related to possession have increased by over 50%.
Cannabis continues to be the drug most often associated with drug law offences.
In Europe, 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005–08 drug action plan, together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period (2009–12).
At the same time, 13 Member States are redrafting or reviewing their national drug strategies or action plans.
Internationally, this year also marks the 10-year review point of the declarations and action plans adopted at the 20th UN General Assembly Special Session (Ungass).
This makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflections on how drug policies have performed to date, and what directions should be pursued in the future.
The reasons for the increase in the number of drug law offences related to drug use are unclear, and could even be related to the possibility that, in some countries, it may have become administratively simpler to issue a conviction for possession.
However, the view held by some that, for drug users and particularly cannabis users, the likelihood of being charged with drug offences has decreased in recent years is not supported by the data.
Furthermore, the extent to which sanctions applied for drug possession have changed is not clear, and the EMCDDA will explore this question in a selected issue next year.
New survey explores young people’s attitudes to drug use
A growing European consensus can be seen in the way Member States have adopted national drug strategies and in their contribution to the global debate on drugs.
All but one of the EU Member States now have national drugpolicy documents, and around half of them now structure their national policy documents along lines similar to those found in the EU action plan — an indication of a growing policy convergence in Europe on how the drug problem should be addressed.
EU Member States, supported by the Commission, have put forward an increasingly united EU position in the ongoing discussions that have accompanied the Ungass review.
In the European contributions to the debates, emphasis has been placed on the need for comprehensive, balanced and evidencebased policies and actions, and on the value of improved monitoring of the global drug problem in the post-Ungass period.
Drug use and the application of criminal sanctions: a mixed picture
In recent years, the EMCDDA has reported a tendency among European countries to make a stronger distinction in their drug laws between those who are trafficking or selling drugs and those using them.
This distinction has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries, though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them.
A recent Eurobarometer survey explored young people’s attitudes and perceptions on drugs and found considerable consensus among countries.
Overall, the risks associated with using drugs such as heroin, cocaine and ecstasy were rated as high by between 81% and 96% of those surveyed.
The vast majority of respondents (95%) felt that these drugs should continue to be controlled in Europe.
Views on cannabis, however, were more divided, with 40% feeling that the drug posed a high risk, while about the same number (43%) considered that cannabis use represented a ‘medium health risk’, broadly similar to the risks associated with smoking tobacco.
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
(67%) and the view held by a substantial minority (31%) that cannabis should be regulated in a similar way to alcohol and tobacco products.
Drug use prevention: evidence base grows but practice is slow to change up employment is one of the key elements of achieving reintegration in to society, and it has been shown to be of high prognostic value.
However, re-entry in to the labour market is often difficult to achieve given the poor skills and low educational status that characterise many of those found among an overall ageing population of chronic drug users in long-term treatment in Europe.
Arriving at a consensus on what constitutes successful outcomes for those with long-term drug problems and as to what extent members of this population can be successfully reintegrated back in to society are becoming increasingly important questions for European drug treatment services.
Despite the almost universal support for drug use prevention, formal evaluations in this area are methodologically challenging and, historically, the evidence available for demonstrating the effectiveness of interventions in this area has been limited.
This situation is changing as the scientific basis for drug prevention continues to grow and more rigorous studies are carried out.
Although inference must still often be drawn from the results of US studies, whose relevance to the European context may be questionable, there is now a growing body of European work.
Together, the information now available allows for a greater understanding of what types of activities are likely to prove effective and how to target those most at risk.
Nevertheless, new data suggests that in many countries, the predominant approaches are often still those that lack a strong evidence base and, in some cases, include activities that may even be counterproductive.
The challenge for policymakers may be that those programmes that are known to deliver benefits often require both a greater investment of resources and more attention to training and quality control.
Although Europe continues to see an expansion of drug treatment provision, considerable variation still exists between countries in the availability of care or the extent to which services address different types of drug problems.
Moreover, widespread recognition of the value of providing drug treatment options to users in prison has yet to be matched by investments in services in this area, which in most countries remain poorly developed.
An important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care tailored to the needs of a more heterogeneous population of drug users.
Against the general background where evidence does not point to a single best approach, some European countries are developing interesting new methods to treat cannabis or cocaine users.
The complex problems caused by different patterns of polydrug use, including alcohol, constitute a challenge for service development.
It is therefore likely that European drug treatment services will have to develop an increasingly differentiated set of responses in the future if they are to match the increasingly differentiated needs of their clients.
To support knowledge transfer and best practice in the drugs field, in 2008 the EMCDDA launched an internet portal on best practice.
The portal, which includes a prevention module, provides an overview of the latest evidence on programme efficacy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interventions.
Examples of evaluated practices across Europe are also provided.
Drug treatment: more emphasis on outcomes and client needs
Recent data from school and adult population surveys suggest that overall cannabis use has stabilised or is declining in some countries.
The number of drug users receiving treatment for their dependency has grown considerably in recent years, and many countries now have a significant proportion of their problem opioid users in long-term substitution treatment.
This trend has led to a widening of the available pharmaceutical options and has resulted in an increased focus on treatment quality and outcome, as opposed to treatment uptake, as a primary policy concern.
Declines in prevalence are most apparent among younger age groups.
New school survey data from the latest HBSC (Health behaviour in school-aged children) study reveal a stable or decreasing trend in drug use among 15-year-old students in most countries during the 2001–2006 period and preliminary reports suggest that this picture may be
Commentary: the drug situation in Europe
At a glance — estimates of drug use in Europe
The estimates presented here relate to the adult population (15–64 years old) and are based on the most recent data available.
For the complete set of data and information on the methodology see the accompanying statistical bulletin.
Lifetime prevalence: at least 71 million (22% of European adults)
Last year use: about 23 million European adults or one-third of lifetime users now visible, and is most evident in the 16–24 age group.
Country variation in last year use: overall range 0.8% to 11.2%
Lifetime prevalence: at least 12 million (3.6% of European adults)
Last year use: 4 million European adults or one-third of lifetime users
Last month use: around 2 million
Despite recent trends, levels of cannabis use in Europe remain high by historical standards, and considerable numbers of regular and intensive users, mostly young males, exist in many countries.
Trends in the numbers of regular and intensive users of cannabis may move independently of the prevalence of use of the drug among the general population, and more focus on these patterns of use and associated problems is required.
Lifetime prevalence: about 9.5 million (2.8% of European adults)
Last year use: over 2.6 million or one-third of lifetime users Last month use: more than 1 million
Country variation in last year use: overall range 0.2% to 3.5%
Cannabis resin has historically been the dominant product in many EU Member States, and western Europe remains overall the major global consumer of this form of the drug.
However, and to a large extent undetected, domestic production of herbal cannabis has been increasing in Europe. Most countries now report local production, which can range from a few plants grown for personal consumption to largescale plantations grown for commercial purposes.
Lifetime prevalence: almost 11 million (3.3% of European adults)
Last year use: around 2 million or one-fifth of lifetime users Last month use: less than 1 million
Country variation in last year use: overall range 0.0% to 1.3%
Problem opioid use: between one and six casesper1000 adult population
In 2005–06, druginduced deaths accounted for 3.5% of all deaths of Europeans 15–39 years old, with opioids being found in around 70% of them
Principal drug in around 50% of all drug treatment requests
More than 600 000 opioid users received substitution treatment in 2006
The extent and relative market share of domestically produced herbal cannabis remains unknown, and in response to this the EMCDDA is carrying out a study on mapping the cannabis market in Europe.
There is also a growing debate about the implications of the evolving cannabis market.
Concerns being voiced include the negative impact of cannabis production sites on local communities through increased levels of criminality, and that domestically produced cannabis is typically of high potency.
Local production also poses a challenge for law enforcement bodies, as production sites are located close to the consumer, relatively easy to conceal and do not necessitate the transportation of drugs across national borders.
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe wastes resulting from synthetic drug production can be considerable.
Cocaine trafficking through west Africa: an area of concern and action population of problem drug users in Europe, but also among the better socially integrated groups of young people who use drugs on a more recreational basis.
However, patterns of stimulant use differ across Europe: cocaine is now the most commonly used stimulant in many countries in the south and west of Europe, and its use continues to grow.
In contrast, the indicators for amphetamine and ecstasy use suggest an overall stable or declining picture.
Nonetheless, amphetamines remain the most used stimulants in most countries in central, northern and eastern Europe, where in some cases they represent an important part of the drug problem.
Methamphetamine use remains rare outside the CzechRepublic and Slovakia, although the availability or use of the drug is sporadically reported by other countries.
As cocaine use continues to rise in Europe, increased efforts are being focused on cocaine interdiction.
Both the volume and number of cocaine seizures continue to increase, with annual seizures now in excess of 120 tonnes, of which more than three quarters are accounted for by Spain and Portugal.
Efforts to counter the trafficking in cocaine in to Europe have been bolstered by the establishment, in Lisbon, of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre–Narcotics (MAOC-N), which is playing an important role in the coordination of interdiction activities and the sharing of intelligence among participating Member States.
As similarities exist in both the settings in which different stimulant drugs are used and in the rationales offered for their use, to some extent these substances can be regarded as competing products on the European drug market.
This would imply that, as well as targeting individual substances, interventions need to consider stimulant drugs as a group rather than only as individual problems.
This point is important, as measures to impact on the availability of one of these substances may be undermined if they simply result in consumers switching to alternative products.
Although cocaine enters Europe by a number of routes, trafficking through west African countries has dramatically increased and now represents a major route for cocaine destined to the European market.
This situation has the potential to destabilise and undermine development efforts in a region already facing many social, health and political challenges.
In particular, the income generated by cocaine trafficking has considerable potential to undermine criminal justice systems and encourage corruption.
The European Union and its Member States are working together with west African countries to develop a range of measures to address this growing threat.
Developments in synthetic drug production in Europe increases concerns about environmental costs
Heroin problems not diminishing alongside reports of increased use of synthetic opioids
The most recent estimates show that, at an estimated 733 tonnes, potential global heroin production has continued to increase.
However, the impact of this increase on the availability and use of this drug in Europe is difficult to gauge.
The available data make drawing conclusions in this area difficult.
For example, the quantity of heroin seized in the European Union has declined slightly, but this has been counterbalanced by considerable increases in Turkey.
Law enforcement data suggest that the production of synthetic drugs, including methamphetamine, may be becoming more sophisticated, with production runs increasing in scale through the use of larger reaction vessels, industrial and custom-made equipment and mobile units.
Typically, the production of one kilogram of amphetamine or MDMA results in around 15–20 kilograms of waste material, including toxic and inflammable chemicals which constitute an environmental hazard.
No strong evidence exists to suggest an epidemic growth in heroin problems similar to the one many parts of Europe experienced in 1990s; overall, the data point to a stable but no longer a diminishing problem.
Commentary: the drug situation in Europe the relative proportion of opioid users — but not their actual numbers — had been falling, but this trend now appears to have levelled out.
And, although there is evidence that Europe’s opioid-using population is slowly ageing, the data suggest that new recruitment is still occurring at a rate that will ensure that the extent of the problem will not significantly decline in the foreseeable future.
However, there remain important differences between countries.
Although data point to an improving situation in Estonia, Latvia and Portugal, these countries still report disproportionately high rates of new infection and account for a significant proportion of all new HIV cases in Europe attributed to drug use.
Data from regional or local studies also suggest that transmission of HIV infection remains an issue in Spain and Italy, although the absence of national case reporting data makes tracking trends in these countries difficult.
Elsewhere, risk behaviour continues and the potential for new epidemics remains, strongly suggesting the need to remain vigilant: for example, Bulgaria reported 34 new cases in 2006, but was reporting virtually no infections in the years 2000–03.
Drugrelated deaths: a major burden on public health
Perhaps counter-intuitively, given the situation in Afghanistan, problems with both diverted and illicitly produced synthetic opioids appear to be increasingly common in some countries.
In Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, for example, there are indications of a growing problem caused by the availability of 3-methylfentanyl that is illicitly manufactured outside the EU.
Due to its strength (fentanyl is considerably more potent than heroin), using this drug can be extremely dangerous, as reflected in over 70 fentanyl-related fatal poisonings reported in Estonia in 2006.
Other countries note a growing number of individuals seeking help with problems related to the use of opioids that appear to have been diverted from therapeutic purposes, and this contributes to the growing polydrug use problem that now characterises chronic drug use in parts of Europe.
Drug injecting and HIV: overall picture positive but important national differences
The EMCDDA monitors fatal poisonings directly attributable to drug use (drug-induced deaths).
There are, on average, around 7 000–8 000 druginduced deaths reported in Europe each year, and due to known underreporting this figure represents a minimum estimate.
Opioids, principally heroin, are the drugs most often associated with overdose, although other drugs and alcohol are commonly present.
After falling for some years in the early part of this decade, the trend in druginduced deaths has now levelled out.
The reasons for this are unclear, indicating a need for more research on both the factors associated with overdose and on the effectiveness of prevention measures.
Drug users leaving prison may be at particular risk, with a recent study reporting mortality rates eight to ten times higher than expected.
Overall, overdose prevention remains an area requiring increased investment.
Studies have also shown that overall mortality, when diseases, accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration, among drug users is up to fifty times higher than that found among the general population.
Over 40% of all heroin users entering outpatient treatment report injecting, underlining that this particularly harmful route of administration remains an important health issue in Europe.
Injecting is associated with a range of problems including, but not limited to, the spread of blood-borne infections including HIV and hepatitis C. Changes in the proportion of injectors among those entering treatment suggest that, in many countries, the overall trend has been away from injecting, although distinct regional and national differences can be seen in the data.
In some countries, particularly in eastern Europe, drug injection remains the principal route of heroin administration and is reported by over 80% of heroin users entering treatment.
Relatively high levels of initiation also appear to be still occurring in some Member States, as indicated by studies among injecting drug users that show a relatively high proportion of young and new injectors.
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe frontline experiences are fed in to the process leading to the new EU drug strategy and inform the evaluation of the EU action plan on drugs.
The importance of consulting with representatives of non-governmental organisations and local communities has also been recognised in the EU drug strategy and echoed in a report adopted by the European Parliament in March 2008 acknowledging the fundamental role of civil society in the development, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of drug policies.
European drugresearch and the need for transnational cooperation substances, although their actual legal status may vary considerably across Europe.
Reports suggest that the number of online retailers of these products is growing and that they adapt rapidly to attempts to control the market, for example through the launch of new products.
In addition, online pharmacies and online retailers selling psychoactive substances for ostensibly legitimate purposes also potentially provide new avenues for illicit drug supply.
Taken together, Internet sales now represent a considerable challenge to both international and national drug policies and control mechanisms.
Given the speed at which new products can appear and be distributed, the monitoring of online activities is becoming an important area for development.
Growing recognition of the importance of dialogue with civil society
Drug problems are intertwined with a range of other social and health issues.
Consequently, successful interventions in this area require the involvement of a broad alliance of participants and can benefit from the support of the communities in which they are implemented.
Over the last decade, drugrelated research and the infrastructure that supports it (research centres, scientific journals, funding mechanisms) has developed greatly in Europe, as shown in a selected issue on research published by the EMCDDA in 2008.
Less positively, this progress has not been accompanied by a comparable increase in the cooperation and coordination of drugrelated research efforts among EU Member States.
Increasing attention is being paid to this issue, and the European Commission has commissioned a new study to provide an inventory of research activity together with a comparative analysis of infrastructures available in Europe and in other regions of the world.
The report will include recommendations on how to improve cooperation at EU level and contribute to a discussion on how to improve the links between European research funding opportunities and needs of research and policy.
Chapter 1 Policies and laws
Introduction themselves to achieving measurable results in reducing the supply and demand for illicit drugs by 2008.
Drugpolicy is set to be an important issue in 2008.
In this year, both the United Nations and the European Union assess the results of their drug policies on the use of, and harms caused by, illicit drugs.
The United Nations reviews the progress made in implementing the measures and reaching the goals decided during the 1998 UN General Assembly Special Session (Ungass) on the world drug problem.
In Europe, 2008 sees the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs (2005–08) and the drafting of the action plan for 2009–12.
Furthermore, an unprecedented number of EU Member States also review their national drug strategies and action plans and draft new drugpolicy documents (1) during this year.
This year’s session of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) has launched the 10-year review of the progress made in reaching the goals and targets set during the 1998 Ungass.
A report presented by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) argued that significant progress has been achieved in the last 10 years, though, in some areas and regions, UN Member States have not fully attained the goals and targets mentioned in the political declaration (3).
This assessment is to be followed by a one-year reflection period, during which discussions will first be held among intergovernmental expert working groups and then in intersessional meetings.
This will allow preparations to be made for a dedicated twoday, high-level, segment at the 2009 CND, which will decide upon a possible future political declaration and measures.
The EMCDDA will discuss the findings and developments made during 2008 in its next annual report.
This year, Chapter 1 focuses on recent changes in drug policy, presents new data on drugrelated public expenditure, explores three specific dimensions of drug laws — possession for personal use, alternatives to punishment, and the focus on protecting the public — and highlights the latest trends in drugrelated offences.
The chapter ends with an overview of drugrelated research in EU Member States.
The European Union is playing an active role in the Ungass review.
Resolutions prepared by the EU were adopted at the 2006 (49/1), 2007 (50/12) and 2008 (51/4) sessions of the CND, all of which call for a scientific and transparent review process.
The EMCDDA has also been involved in expert consultations funded by the European Commission and held by the UNODC, and in this context has provided an overview of drug strategies and responses in Europe since 1998.
Ungass 10-year review
Evaluation of the EU action plan on drugs
In June 1998, the 20th UN General Assembly Special Session (Ungass) convened in New York to debate the world drug problem.
This ‘drug summit’ set a new agenda for the international community through the adoption of three key documents (2
In December 2007, the European Commission presented its second progress review on the implementation of the EU action plan on drugs (2005–08).
It also highlighted difficulties in collecting data
The term ‘national drugpolicy document’ means any official document approved by a government that defines general principles and specific interventions or objectives in the field of drugs, where officially represented as a drug strategy, action plan, programme or other policy document. http://www.un.org/ga/20special/ http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/commissions/CND/session/51.html
Chapter 1: Policies and laws
New developments on supply-reduction activities and in linking some of the planned actions with the indicator chosen to assess their implementation.
The final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs took place in 2008, with input from the EU Member States, Europol and the EMCDDA.
The evaluation report is due to be published by the Commission in autumn 2008, and its findings will contribute to the shaping of the second action plan (2009–12) under the current EU strategy on drugs (2005–12).
New drug action plans or programmes were adopted by four EU Member States (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Finland), Turkey and Norway in the second half of 2007.
All of these documents cover a time span of three to four years and, with the exception of the Turkish action plan, they have been preceded by previous plans or programmes.
In the same year, Spain also adopted a complementary national action programme against cocaine (2007–10).
Other EU developments
In early 2008, three more Member States adopted new policy documents.
Italy’s first drug action plan has a time frame of one year, and is to be followed by a four-year action plan (2009–12), which will be synchronised with the new EU action plan on drugs.
Malta’s first ever national drugpolicy document, while not defining the time frame, includes almost 50 actions to be implemented in the coming years.
Finally, the United Kingdom’s new 10-year drug strategy (2008–18) is, for the first time, complemented by a three-year action plan (2008–11), which defines key actions to be implemented in the near future.
In September 2007, the Council and the European Parliament adopted the ’Drug prevention and information’ programme (4) under the financial framework 2007–13 and the general programme for civil justice and fundamental rights.
The general objectives of the programme are: the prevention and reduction of drug use, dependence and drugrelated harm; to contribute to the improvement of information on drug use; and to support actions taken under the EU drug strategy (2005–12).
Under the programme, EUR 21.35 million will be available for Commission studies, operational costs of European non-governmental organisations in the drugs field, and transnational projects.
Joint actions may also be undertaken with other Community programmes, for example the second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008–13) (5), which, in the part related to health promotion dealing with different health determinants, includes actions on illicit drugs in specific settings, such as schools and workplaces.
The majority of national drugpolicy documents adopted in late 2007 and early 2008 focus mainly on illicit drugs, with some also addressing other substances such as alcohol, tobacco, medicines and performance-enhancing drugs.
This reflects a tendency among European countries, whereby the existence of links and similarities between the use of illicit and licit substances is acknowledged, but drugpolicy documents rarely comprehensively address substances other than illicit drugs (6).
Norway continues to be one of the exceptions to this pattern, with illicit drugs and alcohol fully integrated in its recently adopted action plan.
The numerous national drug strategies and action plans to be developed for 2009, together with those recently adopted, will allow the EMCDDA to examine whether the trend towards increasing integration of licit and illicit drugs in national drug policies, identified in the 2006 selected issue, has continued.
General situation
In June 2006, the European Commission issued a Green Paper on the role of civil society in drug policy, as called for in the current drug action plan.
This was followed in 2007 by the selection process for a new civil society forum on drugs.
The purpose of the forum is to serve as a platform for the informal exchange of views and information between the Commission and civil society organisations in the EU, candidate countries and, as appropriate, European neighbourhood policy countries.
The forum includes 26 organisations representing a wide spectrum of views.
It met for the first time in December 2007 and again in May 2008 to discuss the evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs and the new action plan.
Decision No 1150/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 September 2007 establishing for the period 2007–13 the specific programme ‘drug prevention and information’ as part of the general programme ‘Fundamental rights and justice’ (OJ L 257, 3.10.2007, p. 23).
Decision No 1350/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 establishing a second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008–13) (OJ L 301, 20.11.2007, p. 3).
See the 2006 selected issue European drug policies: extended beyond illicit drugs?
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Figure 1: Trend in the numberofcountries with national drugpolicy documents among the 27 EU Member States, Croatia, Turkey and Norway as in their political, social and economic contexts, the diversity that exists among national drug policies, though diminishing, is likely to remain to some degree in the future.
Some examples of this diversity are highlighted in Chapter 2.
Number
In 2008, 13 EU Member States have already redrafted or are due to review and redraft their national drugpolicy documents, making this a year of unprecedented activity in policymaking at national level.
Following Italy, Malta and the United Kingdom, Ireland will renew its drug strategy in 2008; France, Portugal and Romania will renew their drug action plans; Bulgaria, Spain, Cyprus, Lithuania and Slovakia will renew both their drug strategies and their action plans.
Finally, the Netherlands, which has the oldest national drugpolicy document in Europe, intends to compose a new one during 2008.
No national drugpolicy document
Single national drugpolicy document
Two complementary national drugpolicy documents
There is a growing recognition in Europe of the need to include monitoring and evaluation as an essential component in national drug strategies and action plans.
Almost all of the countries mentioned above have produced or plan to produce a progress review of the implementation of their drug strategies or action plans, and some of them, for example Ireland, Cyprus and Portugal, could produce more in-depth evaluations in 2008.
Reitox national focal points.
EU Member States differ, however, in their methods and approaches for evaluating national drug strategies and action plans; and there is a need to identify best practices in this field.
This was highlighted at a conference on evaluation organised by the Portuguese Presidency of the EU in September 2007.
To respond to this challenge, the EMCDDA, in collaboration with Member States, is exploring the possibility of developing European guidelines in this field.
Drugrelated public expenditure
Convergence can also be seen in the format of drug strategies and action plans. Fourteen countries now structure their national drugpolicy documents along lines similar to those of the current EU drug strategy and action plan.
Moreover, the same numberofcountries now organise their national drug policies using two complementary instruments: a strategic framework and an action plan (Figure 1).
In 2000, when the European Union used this approach for the first time, only two Member States had two complementary drugpolicy documents.
The content of national drugpolicy documents is another area in which there are signs of convergence among the EU Member States, Croatia, Turkey and Norway, with gradually more evidence of common objectives and common interventions in the national drug strategies and action plans adopted by different countries.
However, as European countries differ in their drug problem as well
For 2006, four EU Member States (Czech Republic, Ireland, Poland, Portugal) provided detailed information on public expenditure associated with tackling drugs (summarised in Table 1).
Information on the division of drugrelated expenditure between central government and regional or local government was provided by two of the four countries, allowing a comparison of the role played by the different sectors of government. In the countries for which data are available, the bulk of reported drugrelated public expenditure is allocated to activities that are funded by central government.
Chapter 1: Policies and laws countries highlights the need to adopt a common approach towards monitoring the social cost of drug use in Europe.
Eleven Member States gave details of expenditure by the State on certain activities undertaken in response to the drug problem.
A further two countries provided rough estimates of overall public expenditure related to the drug problem (Spain, Malta), though with no information on the activities on which the money was spent.
In Italy, the social cost of illicit drug use was estimated at EUR 6 473 million, with law enforcement activities accounting for the largest share of the total (43%), and the remainder divided between healthcare and social services (27%) and loss of productivity of drug users and people indirectly affected by drug use (30%).
In addition, it was estimated that drug users spent EUR 3 980 million for the purchase of illicit drugs.
On the basis of these data, the cost of drug use in Italy is estimated to represent 0.7% of the national gross domestic product.
In data reported for Austria, in 2004, the division between direct and indirect costs was the opposite of that reported for Italy: of the estimated social cost of drug use of EUR 1 444 million, 72% was accounted for by indirect costs.
In 2005, the total drugrelated public expenditure by European countries was calculated to lie somewhere between EUR 13 billion and EUR 36 billion (EMCDDA, 2007a).
This figure was estimated by extrapolating the total drugrelated expenditures of six countries (Belgium, Hungary, Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, UnitedKingdom ) to the other States.
A revised estimate, which includes data from additional countries (Czech Republic, France, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia), has recently been proposed (EMCDDA, 2008d).
The new estimate of drugrelated public expenditure in Europe is EUR 34 billion (95% confidence interval, EUR 28–40 billion), which is equivalent to 0.3% of the combined gross domestic product of all EU Member States.
This suggests that State expenditure on the drug problem costs the average EU citizen EUR 60 a year.
These figures must, however, still be taken as indicative because of the limited data on which they are based.
Reports on the social cost of drug use
Data on the social cost of drug use (direct and indirect costs caused by drug use) were reported by four Member States.
While these reports may provide useful insights in to the impact of drug use in the country in which they were conducted, differences in methods and in the way results are reported mean that it is not possible to compare the countries. The lack of comparability in the data from different
Examining the changes in drug legislation that have been made since the 1998 Ungass on drugs is of particular interest in this year of international, European and national reviews and evaluations of drugpolicy documents.
Observing the changes in three key areas, this section

Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe any more than this was raised to a clear minimum of four years in prison, as for a trafficking offence.
Towards a better understanding of drugrelated public expenditure in Europe — EMCDDA 2008 selected issue
In Belgium, the specific criminal offence of use in a group was repealed in 2003; in the same year, an amendment to the Hungarian criminal code permitted diversion to treatment for the supplier of a small quantity to be consumed ‘jointly’ (since appealed as being legally unclear).
In 2006, Malta found that the minimum six-month sentence for suppliers was not always appropriate in situations of sharing, and changed the law to permit exceptions.
In response to the EU drugs action plan 2005–08, the EMCDDA has developed a project aimed at identifying, developing and testing methods for quantifying drugrelated public expenditures.
A selected issue on this topic gives an overview on the overall figures on drugrelated public expenditure in 2005 in the EU Member States and Norway.
Most of the expenditures identified were originally ‘labelled’ as drug related, and were generally traced back by exhaustively reviewing official accountancy documents, thus possibly reflecting the voluntary engagement of the States in the field of drugs.
When feasible, hidden or ‘unlabelled’ expenditures embedded in programmes with broader goals were estimated through modelling techniques.
This new twofold approach provides standardised estimates that maximise the validity and cross-country comparability of public disbursements in tackling drugs and drug addiction.
This selected issue is available in print and on the Internet in English only (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/selectedissues).
asks the question: Do the changes in legal definitions and responses to drug users indicate a new, wider trend in how countries view users of drugs?
Possession for personal use
Regarding punishment, maximum or probable penalties for use or possession for personal use, in the absence of aggravating circumstances, have been reduced in various European countries since 2001 — either for all drugs (Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Finland) or limited to cannabis (Belgium, Luxembourg, UnitedKingdom ) or drugs of lesser risk (Romania).
However, during this period, not all countries have been reducing penalties: France and Poland decided not to change their laws after consultations; and Denmark raised the ‘normal’ penalties from cautions to fines (which were then increased).
A new law in Italy saw drug consumption reinstated as an administrative offence, and cannabis reclassified to be eligible for the same penalties as other illicit substances, such as heroin and cocaine.
In the United Kingdom, it has been announced that cannabis is to be reclassified upwards.
Alternatives to punishment
During the past 10 years, most European countries have moved towards an approach that distinguishes between the drug trafficker, who is viewed as a criminal, and the drug user, who is seen more as a sick person in need of treatment.
However, Member States differ considerably in how they have chosen to define these categories in the new laws that they have adopted in recent years.
The changes in drug users’ access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features. First, they all widen the scope for directing drug users in to treatment.
However, some differences exist between countries regarding the stage at which the offer of treatment is made, with most countries offering treatment at the court stage, rather than at the earlier stages of contact with the police or prosecutors.
In the period 2004–06, Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession, Italy re-enacted it after 12 years without, and the UnitedKingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it.
In 2005, in Slovakia, the legal definitions of personal use were widened from a maximum of one dose to a maximum of three and, for a larger amount, 10 doses.
Countries have introduced or widened options or systems for offenders to be referred to treatment or counselling, as an alternative to punishment or imprisonment, in line with Ungass and EU action plan objectives.
In Ireland and Malta, following arrest, drug users can now be referred to treatment; this is also the case in the United Kingdom, where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances. Special drug courts have been established
Chapter 1: Policies and laws controlled by new laws: trains and ships in Ireland; boats in Latvia; aviation in Finland.
The last few years have also seen: laws and strategies to prevent or punish drugrelated public nuisance (see the 2005 selected issue); new powers to close bars or other premises or exclude people from them (Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands); and powers to close private dwellings where commercial drug distribution or systematic drug use takes place (respectively, Netherlands, UnitedKingdom ).
In parallel, new laws to protect nonusers from the use of tobacco have also been introduced across Europe during this time: since 2004, 24 European Member States (all except Greece, Hungary and Poland) have prohibited or severely restricted smoking in enclosed public places, often with sizeable fines for transgressors.
To summarise the legal changes reviewed here: it appears that criminal sanctions have often been reduced for the individual user who avoids any aggravating circumstances, but, almost as a counterbalance, increased for those whose actions may affect other members of society.
The latter reflects an increased focus on using criminal law to protect the public.
in Ireland, the UnitedKingdom (England and Scotland) and Norway, and are under discussion in Malta; Portugal set up a system of ‘commissions for the dissuasion of drug use’ composed of a lawyer, a doctor and a social worker.
New laws in other countries have introduced some form of treatment as an alternative to punishment: in France, non-dependent drug law offenders may take, and pay for, awareness courses; in Spain, Hungary and Latvia, custodial sentences may be suspended for drug users undertaking treatment; and in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Turkey, probation may be combined with treatment.
The Netherlands aims to increase the use of treatment as a condition of early release from prison.
When deemed appropriate, in Finland, sentenced offenders can now be directed towards an open prison if they stay drugfree; in Greece, they may be sent to a special treatment unit.
Eligibility for drug-treatment programmes has been extended to those convicted of more serious offences in Italy (if the offence is punishable by up to six years in prison, raised from four years) and Spain (raised from three to five years).
In Belgium, at all levels of the criminal justice process, alternatives exist to divert drug-using offenders in to treatment.
Further descriptions of the various treatment alternatives to punishment and the extent of their use can be found in the

Focus on protecting the public
Though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking, it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced.
In the past decade, criminal law has increasingly been used to protect the public from the drug user and, in parallel with the distinction made between the ‘sick’ user and the ‘criminal’ trafficker, the category of ‘user’ is also being legally subdivided in to those who do and those who do not trouble or harm other members of society.
The measures that reduce criminal penalties for personal use or offer alternatives to punishment, described above, are part of this development.
Use- and supply-related offences
Most legislative activity has concentrated on those taking drugs and then driving (Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Spain, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Finland).
New laws regulating testing for drugs in the workplace in Ireland, Finland and Norway emphasise that testing is permitted mainly in situations where considerable danger or risk would arise from being under the influence.

The trends represent the available information on national number of reports for drug law offences (criminal and non-criminal) reported by all law enforcement agencies in the EU Member States; all series are indexed to a base of 100 in 2001 and weighted by country population sizes to form an overall EU trend; the total number of offences reported in 2006 in countries included in the trends (before weighting) were: amphetamine, 41069; cannabis, 550878; cocaine, 100117; ecstasy, 17 598; heroin, 77 242; all reports, 936 866. Countries missing data for two or more consecutive years are not included in the trend calculations: the overall trend is based on all EU countries except the United Kingdom; the trend for cannabis is based on 18 countries, heroin on 18, cocaine on 17, amphetamine on 12 and ecstasy on 13.

National drugrelated research specifically designated for drugrelated research can be available through national drug coordination bodies (Czech Republic, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Norway).
Both types of funding programmes often couple research on illicit drugs with other areas within the addiction field, such as alcohol, tobacco and gambling.
The funds are mostly available through contracts for commissioned research or through framework programmes to which researchers apply.
Other types of funding sources reported include foundations, scientific academies, private institutions, special funds for the fight against drugs, the European Commission and the United Nations.
Structures and projects
Based on reports from 25 Member States, Croatia and Norway, it is possible to give an overview of the organisation of drugrelated research in European countries.
At a time when the importance of evidencebased interventions is increasingly acknowledged, it is notable that 21 countries reported that research results inform drug policy, at least to some degree.
Coordinating and funding
The majority of countries reported that research takes place mostly in universities and in specialised centres, some of them hosting national focal points, followed by public and private research centres.
National research networks were reported by some countries (Germany, Spain, Portugal).
These can play an important role in the organisation and funding of research, and may also promote more direct links between research and practice.
Drugrelated research is mentioned in the national drug strategy or action plan of 20 of the 27 reporting countries, either as a specific topic or referred to as an essential component of evidencebased policy.
In 15 of the 27 reporting countries, structures to coordinate drugrelated research exist at national level.
Only five countries report that drugrelated research is not mentioned in their national strategies or that they do not have a national coordination structure in this field.
Among the major studies carried out since 2000 reported by the Member States, more than half were in epidemiology and about one third in applied research (mainly evaluations of interventions in prevention and treatment).
Also cited were studies in determinants, risk and protective factors for drug use, consequences of drug use, and drug mechanisms and affects.
Constraints to drugrelated research were reported by several countries.
Among the problems identified were: organisational aspects, such as a lack of coordination and scattered resources (Germany, France, Austria); the
Detailed information on research in the drugs field carried out in European countries has been collected by the EMCDDA through its network of Reitox national focal points.
The information provided by the Member States includes a description of national research organisations and funding arrangements. Member States have also provided lists of main studies carried out since 2000 and identified scientific papers, scientific journals and websites through which the findings of drugrelated research carried out in their country have been disseminated.
The EMCDDA is making this and more information available through different dissemination products and channels (see http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/themes/research).
The European Commission has commissioned an in-depth comparative analysis of research in to illicit drugs in the European Union.
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe lack of qualified research staff (Latvia, Hungary); and methodological aspects (data protection issues, problems in reaching hidden populations, lack of continuity in research projects).
Several countries identified the limited funding available for drugrelated research as a major constraint (Belgium, Greece, Poland, Romania, Finland).
Dissemination abstracts and welcome international contributions.
In addition to publications specialising in illicit drugs and addiction, articles on illicit drug use are also published in peer-reviewed journals from a wide array of disciplines and in professional magazines.
In 2006, research findings in the drugs field were published in more than 100 such European journals.
Other types of publication, including those by national focal points, also play an important role in dissemination.
A total of 25 European peer-reviewed journals specialising in the drugs field and publishing in 11 languages other than English were identified.
The majority of these national journals publish English
Reitox national focal points also play an important role in disseminating research results in all the reporting countries, mainly by means of their national reports.
Chapter 2 Responding to drug problems in Europe — an overview
Introduction
Improving the monitoring of drug supply reduction
This chapter presents an overview of the responses to drug problems in Europe, where possible highlighting trends, developments and quality issues.
The set of measures reviewed here includes prevention, treatment, harmreduction and social reintegration, which taken together form a comprehensive demand-reduction system.
The chapter also includes a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting.
In addition, future monitoring challenges in another field of drug policy, drug supply reduction, are briefly discussed.
Drug supply reduction can be defined as encompassing all activities aimed at preventing illicit drugs from reaching users.
These may include instruments such as international conventions, and EU and national legislation and policies, as well as actions addressing the various processes and actors involved in the production and trafficking of illicit drugs but also involved in the diversion or illicit manufacture of licit substances (medicines, precursor chemicals) for illicit ends and in the laundering of drug money.
Law enforcement activities, alternative development initiatives and projects aimed at preventing drugrelated crime all contribute to reducing the supply of illicit drugs.
Monitoring and analysis constitute, as is the case with drug demand reduction, an important support for these activities and their evaluation.
Drug prevention can be divided in to different levels or strategies, from environmental to indicated prevention, which ideally do not compete but complement each other.
The following description of the current situation and trends in Europe is based on qualitative data on the provision of universal and selective prevention reported to the EMCDDA in 2007 (17) and on a literature review on indicated prevention (EMCDDA, 2008f).
Recent data collection exercises in the framework of the annual progress reviews of the EU action plan on drugs and the Ungass review (see Chapter 1) have revealed a mixed picture regarding the availability of response data in the supply reduction field.
Activities related to international projects are usually well documented, while data on activities at national level are often difficult to access and compare.
The European Commission, Eurostat, Europol and the EMCDDA are working to improve this situation in the framework of the next EU action plan on drugs (2009–12).
Existing conceptual frameworks and information systems, as well as potential information sources for monitoring and analysing supply reduction activities in the Member States, are to be reviewed.
There is also a need to better understand drug markets, in particular supply and distribution arrangements, both in their economic and social dimensions.
Two studies funded by the European Commission will explore both the information systems and sources on drug supply reduction and the international drug markets.
The objectives of universal school-based drug prevention in Europe appear to have shifted in recent years.
In 2007, developing life skills was the most frequently reported objective of prevention activities (12 out of 28 reporting countries), whereas in 2004, half of the countries (13/26) reported raising awareness and providing information as their main objective.
Creating protective school environments, a form of structural intervention, was also more often mentioned as a main objective in 2007 (six countries) than it was in 2004 (four countries).
The changes in reported objectives may reflect the adoption of a more rational and evidencebased approach, but the extent to which this change in objectives reflects actual provision is unclear.
Events for parents and strategies solely providing information (information days, visits of experts or of police agents at schools) are among the types of school-based intervention reported by the largest numberofcountries (Figure 3).
The effectiveness of these interventions is unclear.
In contrast, some of the more strongly evidencebased interventions are reported in only a few countries.
These include standardised programmes, peer approaches or interventions specifically for boys; all of which aim

Drugs and vulnerable groups of young people — EMCDDA 2008 selected issue and five report providing interventions for family conflict and neglect.
In addition, the following categories of interventions were each reported by four countries: addressing social disadvantage (e.g. unemployment), helping with criminal justice problems, or assisting marginalised families from ethnic minorities.
Furthermore, only three countries address the needs of families coping with mental health problems.
Risk conditions of young vulnerable groups, for example, young offenders, homeless, truant, disadvantaged and minority youth, are also rarely addressed despite increasing political importance.
Since 2004, an increasing number of drug policies have indicated them as primary targets for prevention interventions, but the reported level of intervention provision has not increased during this period.
More detailed data a represented in the 2008 selected issue on vulnerable groups of young people.
Indicated prevention

outcomes on smoking and cannabis use compared to treatment as usual (Zonnevylle-Bender et al., 2007).
Efficacy and risks of interventions
Indicated prevention aims to identify individuals with behavioural or psychological problems that may be predictive for developing problem substance use later in life, and to target them individually with special interventions.
Such individuals include school dropouts, and those with psychiatric disorders, antisocial behaviour or early signs of drug use.
A report recently published by the EMCDDA (2008f) presents longitudinal studies defining problem trajectories, neurobehavioural studies and the increasing knowledge about brain plasticity and the role of neurotransmitters, and highlights findings from interventions reported by Member States.
Drug use among children and in families remains the main focus of targeted prevention in Europe.
A large number of studies on the social and neurobehavioural predictors for progression in to substance use show that non-drug-focused prevention efforts may also have an effect on drug use.
Both selective and indicated prevention may moderate the effect of an early developmental disadvantage, its translation in to social marginalisation and subsequent progression in to substance abuse.
Several research studies have shown that interventions delivered during the early school years, aimed to improve educational environments and reduce social exclusion, also have a moderating effect on later substance use (Toumbourou et al., 2007).
The overall effectiveness of school-based prevention has been questioned (Coggans, 2006; Gorman et al., 2007).
Recent literature reviews (19), however, show that certain
Children with behavioural disorders, such as coexisting attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder and conduct disorder, are at high risk of developing substance use problems.
Intervening early with children with behavioural disorders requires close cooperation between medical, social and youth services.
The German ‘multi-module treatment concept’, for example, offers a combination of counselling for parents and carers; concurrent medical, psychotherapeutic and psychosocial support; and educational support in the kindergarten or school.
The Irish approach of targeted education and psychological counselling for young people, especially for preventing developmental problems in schools, education facilities and the family, yielded overall positive evaluation results.
The EMCDDA ‘Best practice’ portal content of prevention projects.
The number of Member States reporting standards for project design and evaluation has increased from three in 2004 to nine in 2007.
Several Member States report that they are developing certification processes to guarantee the quality of programmes and the efficient use of resources from public budgets (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Portugal).
In the Czech Republic, for instance, certification of preventive activities is a condition for receiving subsidies from the State budget.
The EMCDDA has this year launched the first module of its Internet portal on best practice for drugrelated interventions (prevention, treatment, harmreduction and social reintegration).
The portal provides an overview on the latest evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of different interventions, presenting tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interventions, as well as highlighting examples of evaluated practice from across Europe.
It is aimed at practitioners, policymakers and researchers in the drugs field and has a strong Europewide focus.
This section aims to provide an overview of drug treatment in Europe, describing the organisation and provision of services.
The first module of the portal focuses on universal prevention, in particular on evidence of efficacy which is based on several reviews published since 2000.
For details of the findings, see the portal (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/themes/best-practice).
The portal provides information on the efficacy of various interventions, but it should be noted that the evidence base remains sometimes limited and that making choices between different interventions requires caution.
Furthermore, as controlled trials measure the efficacy of programmes, how certain interventions will perform in different settings remains subject to question.
The new edition of the EDDRA databank, available on the portal, features examples of evaluated interventions in different countries and settings, and may provide additional guidance.
General practitioners also play an important role, and in some countries are key providers of substitution treatment.
The private sector can also be involved in some countries, mainly in residential care.
Nevertheless, funding for drug treatment is mostly provided by the public purse or is linked to social or health insurances.
Provision study found that 15 months after the intervention, the effect of the programme remained stable, with reduced frequencies of drunkenness and of cannabis use observed among participants.
The ‘Unplugged’ programme used in the trial challenged norms about the acceptance and beliefs about the prevalence of substance use among youth.
Prevention should not only be effective but must also be safe — unwanted effects must be kept to a minimum. Thus, the risks of negative effects should be considered carefully when designing and evaluating interventions.
This is particularly important for universal school-based prevention, which is delivered to a large and diverse target population.
For instance, providing information about drug effects alone, a widespread approach in Europe, is not only ineffective but may carry risks of unwanted effects (Werch and Owen, 2002).
The same applies to mass-media campaigns, which can carry risks of increasing the propensity for substance use (21).
Drug treatment takes place in a variety of settings, including outpatient and inpatient treatment centres, general practice, lowthreshold agencies and prison.
Outpatient settings, including general practice, account for most of the treatment for drug use in Europe, mainly because substitution treatment is usually delivered in these settings.
Drug users entering treatment in outpatient settings are, according to the latest figures from the treatment demand indicator, on average around 30 year sold and predominantly male (22).
Around one third refer themselves to treatment, 22% are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system, with this figure growing in recent years, and the remaining are referred through social and health services or through informal networks (23).
One way to ensure that prevention programmes are evidencebased and that risks of unwanted effects are reduced is to develop standards for the delivery and
Half of the clients entering treatment in outpatient settings reported primary opioid use, while 21% cited cannabis and 16% cocaine as their primary drug. Increases in the

proportion of clients, and especially new clients, referred to treatment for problems with non-opioid drugs may reflect improvements in treatment availability for users of cannabis and cocaine in several Member States as well as an increase in the numbers of users seeking treatment for these drugs (see Chapters 3 and 5).
However, the overall availability of services specifically targeted to the needs of non-opioid drug users remains limited.
Treatment in inpatient settings takes place mostly in therapeutic communities, psychiatric hospitals and specialised departments in general hospitals.
The services provided range from short-term detoxification to prolonged psychiatric and abstinence-based treatment programmes.
Residential services can be particularly suited for drug users with complex treatment needs, due to co-morbid physical and mental health problems.
Inpatient clients are, on average, similar to outpatient clients: around 30 years old, mainly males and entering drug treatment for primary opioid use (24).
The proportion
In addition, most countries provide a range of healthcare and social services at lowthreshold agencies. However, some countries report that the implementation of harmreduction measures has been delayed due to the lack of political support.
In Greece, expansion of lowthreshold services and substitution treatment has been stalled; needle and syringe programmes in Romania and Poland were scaled down in 2006, after external funding ceased; Cyprus’s only needle and syringe exchange programme is not officially endorsed.
In Hungary, where NSPs and outreach work have been increasing, a study among the out-of-treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high.
of drug clients with no employment and unstable accommodation is, however, higher among inpatient clients than among outpatient clients, in most countries where comparison is possible (25
Due to the specific profile of the Baltic States and Romania with regard to HIV/AIDS, international donors continue to play an important role in these countries.
Financial support for harmreduction activities is provided by the Global Fund ‘Programme to fight against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis’, while in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, UNODC has recently launched the project ‘HIV/AIDS prevention and care among injecting drug users and in prison settings’.
Historically, drug-treatment services have been organised around the needs of opioid users, who still represent the main group of users in treatment.
In the majority of Member States, substitution treatment combined with psychosocial care has become the predominant option for opioid users.
With the introduction of high-dosage buprenorphine treatment in Cyprus in 2007, substitution treatment is now available in all Member States and in Croatia and Norway (26).
In Turkey, substitution treatment has yet to be introduced, though it is permitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres.
After methadone, buprenorphine is the second most commonly prescribed opioid substitute, and its use in the treatment of opioid dependence has increased in recent years (see Chapter 6).
It is now available as a treatment option in all Member States except Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland.
In 2006, it is estimated that 600 000 opioid users received substitution treatment in Europe, with an increase since the previous year being reported in 16 of the 22 countries providing data.
Finally, some Member States have recently looked at the consequences of the introduction of harmreduction interventions.
In France, the observed decrease in mortality rates among drug users coincided with the introduction of triple antiviral therapies, the development of a harmreduction policy and the availability of opioid substitution treatments; in Spain, the decreasing number of injectors combined with easy access to methadone maintenance treatment was associated with a decline of infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths among drug users (De la Fuente et al., 2006); and in Portugal, available data show a levelling off of infectious diseases, which probably can be attributed, in part, to an increase in the availability of harmreduction and treatment responses.
The prevention and reduction of drugrelated harm is a public health objective in all Member States and in the EU drug strategy and action plan (European Commission, 2007a).
Drug users in treatment often report high levels of unemployment and homelessness.
Such disadvantage tends also to be more widespread among specific groups
See Tables TDI-10 (part vii) and TDI-21 (part iv) in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
Chapter 2: Responding to drug problems in Europe — an overview provision of services to imprisoned drug users and new laws on drug treatment in prison.
of users, particularly women, heroin and crack users, those who belong to ethnic minorities and those with co-morbid psychiatric problems.
The fact that drugs find their way in to most prisons, despite all measures being taken to reduce the supply of drugs, is recognised by both prison experts and policymakers.
Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1% and 56% of inmates report having used drugs within prison, and up to a third of inmates have injected drugs while in custody (32).
This raises concerns around the potential spread of infectious diseases, especially in relation to the sharing of injection equipment.
Helping drug treatment clients find employment is a key element in social reintegration, as one in every two clients entering treatment is unemployed (28).
New approaches to helping clients to find and hold down employment are reported to have shown success, these include: ‘mentoring schemes’, subsidised workplaces (since 2006 also possible in Lithuania), and special coaching of employers and employees, as carried out under the ‘Ready for work’ project in Ireland, or various ‘work and social agencies’ in the Czech Republic.
Health and social responses in prison
Prisons represent an important setting for the delivery of health and social interventions to drug users.
In this section, data on drug use and drug users in European prisons is reviewed along with recent information on the
The prison population in the European Union is over 607 000 (33), with an estimated annual turnover of more than 860 000 prisoners.
In most countries, the proportion of prisoners sentenced for drug law offences is in the range of 10–30%.
From the data available, it can be estimated that more than 400 000 people with past or current experience of illicit drug use pass through EU prisons every year.
And among these, there will be a considerable number of problem drug users.
The healthcare needs of this large population of former or current drug users in European prisons will, to some extent, be determined by health problems related to drug use, notably infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV/AIDS (see Chapter 7).
See Table TDI-15 in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
See Table TDI-20 in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
The term ‘prisoners’ is used in a broad sense here, and includes both on-remand and convicted incarcerated persons.
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Healthcare areas: drugrelated information and prevention; screening for infectious diseases and vaccinations; and drug dependence treatment, including substitution treatment.
In addition, these interventions have become more widely available within countries.
Prison-based substitution treatment is officially available in all countries except Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Cyprus, Slovakia and Turkey, though, in many countries, the overall accessibility of this treatment option is limited.
Spain is currently the only European country that provides a wide range of harmreduction measures in prisons.
The responsibility for healthcare in prison lies, in most countries, with the Ministry of Justice.
However, this is changing, and in a growing number of European countries, the responsibility has been transferred to the health system (France, Italy, England and Wales in the United Kingdom, Norway).
In Spain, comprehensive services for drug users are developed in all prisons according to the action plan of the national strategy on drugs (2000–08) and based on a cooperation protocol between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of the Interior, signed in 2005.
In other countries, in order to meet the needs of increasing numbers of incarcerated drug users, prisons have established cooperation with public health services and specialist non-governmental drugs agencies in the community.
Interventions targeting drug-using prisoners have expanded in the European Union.
Compared to five years ago, more countries now report activities in the following
In 2006, only four Member States reported sociodemographic data and information on drug use patterns of prisoners in drug treatment through their national treatment monitoring systems.
In France, Cyprus and Slovakia, an opioid, usually heroin, is most often reported as the primary drug by those entering drug treatment; while in Sweden, primary amphetamine use is the main reason for entering treatment in prison, reflecting broadly the patterns of problem drug use within these countries.
Recent legislation on drug treatment in prison
In 2006 and early 2007, six countries revised their legal frameworks and guidelines affecting prisoners’ rights to drug treatment.
In Romania, a new legal basis for establishing substitution treatment in prisons was created in May 2006 by the Common Order of the Ministries for Justice, Public Health, and Administration and Internal Affairs regarding the continuation of integrated medical, psychological and social assistance programmes for inmates.
In Belgium, a 2006 directive from the Ministry for Justice states that inmates have the right to the same range of treatment options as are available outside prison.
Meanwhile, in Ireland new Prison Service guidelines emphasise the healthcare standard for treatment services, which should be comparable to those available in the community, while being appropriate to the prison setting.
In Denmark, a change in the law from January 2007 entitles imprisoned drug users to free treatment for their drug use.
The law stipulates that the treatment should normally start within 14 days of the prisoner requesting it from the Danish Prison and Probation Service.
However, there is no such entitlement if the offender is expected to be released within three months or is considered unfit or not motivated for treatment.
In Norway, a circular in 2006 from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs strengthened cooperation between the two sectors and aimed at providing better follow-up during and after the serving of sentences.
More specifically, in Slovakia, a 2006 law permitted the provision of psychological services to drug users on remand who are suffering from withdrawal symptoms.
The aim of this law is to provide drug users with such services at the time when they are most needed, at the time of enforced withdrawal immediately upon entering custody.
It also created a legislative framework to support the existing special treatment units for convicted drug users.

Drug supply and availability — data and sources
Systematic and routine information to describe illicit drug markets and trafficking is still limited.
Production estimates of heroin, cocaine and cannabis are obtained from cultivation estimates based on fieldwork (sampling on the ground) and aerial or satellite surveys.
These estimates have some important limitations linked, for instance, with variations in yield figures or with the difficulty of monitoring crops which are not grown in restricted geographical areas, like cannabis.
Drug seizures are often considered as an indirect indicator of the supply, trafficking routes and availability of drugs; however, they also reflect law enforcement priorities, resources and strategies, the vulnerability of traffickers and reporting practices.
Data on purity or potency and retail prices of illicit drugs may also be analysed in order to understand retail drug markets.
However, the availability of this type of data may be limited and there may be questions of reliability and comparability.
Intelligence information from law enforcement agencies may help complete the picture.
The European picture in respect to cannabis has evolved considerably over the last decade, as has the debate on how to respond appropriately to the widespread use of this drug.
In the early and mid-1990s a few countries stood out as having a high prevalence, whereas the European norm was levels of use which, by today’s standards, were low.
In almost all countries, cannabis use increased during the 1990s and early 2000s, and this has resulted today in a far less varied European picture, even if differences between countries still exist.
Moreover, the last few years have seen a growing understanding of the public health implications of the long-term and widespread use of this drug, and rising reported levels of treatment demand for cannabis-related problems.
Europe may now be moving in to a new phase, as data are pointing to a stabilising or even decreasing situation.
Levels of use remain high by historical standards, however; what constitutes an effective response to cannabis use remains a key question in the European debate on drugs.
The EMCDDA collects national data on drug seizures, purity and retail prices in Europe.
Other data on drug supply comes largely from UNODC’s information systems and analyses, complemented by additional information from Europol.
Information on drug precursors is obtained from the INCB, which is involved in international initiatives to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs.
As many parts of the world lack sophisticated information systems related to drug supply, some of the estimates and other data reported, though representing the best approximations available, must be interpreted with caution.
(Reitox national reports). Herbal cannabis in Europe is also reported to come from other parts of the world, including: west and southern Africa (Nigeria, Angola), south-east Asia (Thailand), south-west Asia (Pakistan) and the Americas (Colombia, Jamaica) (CND, 2008; Europol, 2008).
Cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world, and it is currently believed that the plant is cultivated in 172 countries and territories (UNODC, 2008) (34).
These facts taken together mean that producing estimates of the worldwide production of cannabis with any precision is likely to be very difficult.
The latest UNODC figure for the global production of herbal cannabis stands at 41 600 tonnes (2006), of which more than half is accounted for by the Americas (North America and South America) and close to a quarter by Africa (UNODC, 2008).
The widespread cultivation of cannabis also means that a significant proportion of trafficking is likely to be intraregional.
This is the case for some herbal cannabis in
Europe, where in addition to home production (35

Chapter 3: Cannabis
Cannabis production in Europe
76 400 hectares producing 1 066 tonnes in 2005 (UNODC and Government of Morocco, 2007).
Resin production is also reported in Afghanistan, where it is rising rapidly, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Central Asian and other CIS countries (UNODC, 2008).
Cannabis resin produced in Morocco is typically smuggled in to Europe via the Iberian peninsula (Europol, 2008), with some of it being further distributed from the Netherlands.
In 2006, 52 30 tonnes of herbal cannabis and 10 25 tonnes of cannabis resin were seized worldwide, down from peak levels in 2004.
North America continued to account for the bulk of herbal cannabis seized (58%), while quantities of resin seized remained concentrated in western and central Europe (62%) (UNODC, 2008).
Available information is patchy and does not allow an accurate assessment of the extent of cannabis cultivation in Europe.
Nevertheless, reports from a numberofcountries suggest that it may no longer be viewed as marginal.
For example, French population surveys in 2005 estimated that about 200 000 people had grown cannabis at least once in their lifetime.
In the United Kingdom, more than 1 500 ‘cannabis farms’, with 400 plants per site on average, were reportedly closed down by police in London in 2005–06 (Daly, 2007) and most herbal cannabis now available is thought to be produced either locally or in other European countries.
In the Netherlands, cannabis cultivation is widespread in some parts of the country, with an estimated total of 6 000 cultivation sites dismantled in 2005 and 2006.
In Europe, an estimated 177 000 seizures of herbal cannabis, amounting to 86 tonnes, were made in 2006 (36).
The UnitedKingdom is the EU Member State reporting the most seizures of herbal cannabis, though data are not yet available for 2006.
Turkey reported seizures of record amounts of herbal cannabis in 2006.
The number of herbal cannabis seizures in Europe has increased steadily since 2001, while there has been an overall decrease in the quantity seized, until 2005, with an increase noted in the most recent data.
Cannabis production seems to have experienced a sharp increase from the early to mid-1990s in some western European countries, partly as a response of cannabis consumers to the perceived poor quality and high price of imported resin, then the most widely used cannabis product.
In some countries, it seems that a majority of users are now consuming locally produced herbal cannabis.
This partial substitution of domestically produced herbal cannabis for imported resin was made possible by advances in horticultural knowledge and technology (to maximise yields and avoid detection), which then spread through the Internet (Hough et al., 2003; Jansen, 2002; Szendrei, 1997/98).
Cannabis that is produced locally also has the advantage for the producer that it does not need to be transported across national borders.
Seizures of cannabis resin in Europe exceed herbal seizures both in terms of number and quantity: with twice as many seizures (325 000) and the amount intercepted (713 tonnes) eight times higher.
After a period of stabilisation in 2001–03, the number of cannabis resin seizures is increasing in Europe, while the quantities intercepted increased until 2003–04, but thereafter have been declining.
In 2006, an estimated 10 500 seizures in Europe resulted

The data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR-1, SZR-2, SZR-3, SZR-4, SZR-5 and SZR-6 in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
Since Turkey reported having seized no cannabis plants in 2005 and 2006, after reporting high levels of seizures of this material over 2001–04, it was excluded from the European analysis.
This picture is preliminary as data for the United Kingdom, the country reporting the most cannabis plants seized in 2005, are not yet available for 2006.
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Population surveys: an important tool for understanding patterns and trends of drug use in Europe
Drug use in the general or school population can be measured through representative surveys, which provide estimates of the proportion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time.
Surveys also provide useful contextual information on patterns of use, sociodemographic characteristics of users and perceptions of risks and availability (1).
In 2006, the reported THC content of resin samples ranged from 2.3% to 18.4%, while that of herbal cannabis ranged from under 1% to 13%.
Estimates of the potency of locally produced herbal cannabis over a number of years are available only for the Netherlands, which reported a decline to 16.0% in 2006, from a peak of 20.3% in 2004 (39).
However, there are still differences between countries in the methodology used and year of data collection, and this means that small differences, in particular between countries, should be interpreted with caution (3).
As surveys are expensive to conduct, few European countries collect information each year, although many collect it at intervals of two to four years. In this report, data a represented based on the most recent survey available in each country, which in most cases is between 2004 and 2007.
For adults, the focus is on last year and last month use (4). Identifying those who are using regularly or having problems with their use of drugs is important, and progress is being made in this respect with the development of short scales to assess more intensive forms of use in the general population, adults and school students (see the box on developing psychometric scales in the 2007 annual report).
It is conservatively estimated that cannabis has been used at least once (lifetime prevalence) by more than 70 million Europeans, that is over one in five of all 15- to 64-year- olds (see Table 2 for a summary of the data).
Although considerable differences exist between countries, with national figures varying from 2% to 37%, half of the countries report estimates in the range 11–22%.
More information on survey methodology is available in the 2008 statistical bulletin (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/stats08/gps/methods).
The EMCDDA standard age ranges are: all adults (15–64 years) and young adults (15–34 years).
This report uses the terms ‘lifetime use or prevalence’, ‘last year prevalence’ and ‘lastmonth prevalence’ and, sometimes, the more colloquial terms ‘lifetime experience’, ‘recent use’ and ‘current use’, respectively.
generally being reported among the 15- to 24-year-olds.
This is the case in almost all European countries, the exceptions being Belgium, Cyprus and Portugal (40).
Many countries report comparatively high prevalence levels of last year and last month use of cannabis.
It is estimated that around 23 million Europeans have used cannabis in the last year, or on average, about 7% of all 15- to 64-year-olds.
Estimates of last month prevalence will include those using the drug more regularly, though not necessarily in an intensive way (see below).
It is estimated that about 12.5 million Europeans used the drug in the previous month, on average about 4% of all 15- to 64-year-olds.
Cannabis use among young adults
Cannabis use is largely concentrated among young people (15–34 years), with the highest levels of use
Population survey data suggest that, on average, 31% of young European adults (15–34 years) have ever used cannabis, while 13% have used the drug in the last year and 7% have used it in the last month.
It is estimated that even higher proportions of Europeans in the 15–24 age
See Tables PPP-1 and PPP-5 in the 2008 statistical bulletin for potency and price data.

Chapter 3: Cannabis between 21% and 31% (Currie et al., 2008) (41).
In this age group, boys usually report a higher prevalence of cannabis use than girls, but the difference in reported prevalence between the sexes is small or even absent in some of the countries with the highest prevalence estimates.
group have used cannabis in the last year (17%) or last month (9%), though on average slightly fewer among this age group have tried the drug (30%).
National prevalence estimates of cannabis use vary widely between countries in all measures of prevalence, with countries at the upper end of the scale reporting values up to 10 times those of the lowest-prevalence countries.
Cannabis use is higher among males than among females (see the 2006 selected issue on gender), although marked differences between countries are observed.
For example, the ratio of males to females among those reporting use of cannabis in the last year ranged from 6.4 males for each female in Portugal to 1.3 in Italy.
Cannabis use among school students
As with lifetime experience, there is a wide variation between countries in estimates of use in the last 30 days among school students.
In some countries it is virtually unreported, whereas in others around 15% of those questioned report use during the last 30 days, with sometimes even higher figures found among males.
On the basis of data collected in earlier ESPAD surveys, it is estimated that in 2003 around 3.5 million (22.1%) 15- to 16-year-old school students had used cannabis at least once in their lifetime in the EU Member States together with Croatia and Turkey, and, around 1.7 million (11%) had used the drug in the month prior to the survey.
After tobacco and alcohol, cannabis also continues to be the psychoactive substance most commonly used by school students.
Ever in lifetime use of cannabis by 15- to 16-year-old school students may be taken to reflect recent or current use as first experimenting with this substance often occurs at or around this age.
Data from the 2005/06 HBSC survey of 15-year-olds showed large variation in lifetime prevalence of cannabis use across 27 countries.
European figures can be compared with those from other parts of the world.
For instance, in the United States, the national survey on drug use and health (Samhsa, 2005) estimated a lifetime prevalence of cannabis use of 49% among young adults (15–34 years, recalculated by the EMCDDA) and a last year prevalence of 21%.
For the same age group, lifetime prevalence of cannabis use was 58% and last year prevalence 28% in Canada (2004), while in Australia (2004) the figures were 48% and 20%.
Patterns of cannabis use
Available data point to a variety of patterns of cannabis use.
Of those aged 15–64 who have ever used cannabis, only 30% have done so during the last year (42). But,
The ‘Health behaviour in school-aged children’ (HBSC) survey is a WHO collaborative study which investigates children’s health and health behaviour and has included questions about cannabis use among 15-year-old students since 2001.
The second round of this survey with questions about cannabis use was conducted between October 2005 and May 2006, with the participation of 26 EU Member States and Croatia.
among those who have used the drug in the last year, on average 56% have done so in the last month.
The fourth round of the ‘European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs’ (ESPAD) was conducted in 2007 with the participation of 25 EU Member States, Croatia and Norway.
This survey specifically investigates substance use among school students who turn 16 during the calendar year.
Results from the latest surveys will be published in December 2008.
Participation in both of these international school surveys, each conducted every four years, has grown in each round and now includes most European countries.
Spain, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden and the UnitedKingdom also reported data on cannabis use from their own national school surveys in 2006.
Estimating intensive and long-term patterns of use is an important public health issue. Daily or almost daily use (use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days) may be an indicator of intensive use.
Data on this form of cannabis use in Europe was collected in 2007/08 as part of a ‘field trial’ coordinated by the EMCDDA in collaboration with national experts and the Reitox focal points of 13 countries.
On the basis of this data, albeit limited, it is estimated that over 1% of all European adults, about 4 million, are using cannabis daily or almost daily. Most of these cannabis users, about 3 million, are aged 15–34,

Patterns of cannabis use among school students
Trends in intensive cannabis use in Europe are difficult to assess, but among the countries participating in both field trials in 2004 and 2007 (Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal), the average increase was about 20%, although this estimation is largely influenced by the figures of Spain, France and Italy.
HBSC data show that frequent cannabis use remains rare among 15-year-old schoolchildren.
Only six countries report a prevalence of frequent cannabis use (defined here as 40 times or more during the previous 12 months) above 2%. However, frequent use is generally more prevalent among males, with estimates up to 5% in seven countries.
Reports indicate that correlations exist between the more problematic patterns of cannabis use and belonging to a vulnerable group (e.g. young offenders, truants, low educational achievers), suggesting that specific strategies are needed to provide a safety net for these particularly vulnerable young people.
This issue is highlighted in the 2008 selected issue on vulnerable groups.
Repeated use of cannabis can be fairly stable over long periods of time, even among younger users.
The comparison shows that, on average, students who have used cannabis are more likely to have used other substances.
Although among cannabis users the last month prevalence of other drug use remained low (below 10%), levels of cigarette smoking and binge drinking among cannabis users was about double that (80%) found among the general student population.
Cannabis dependence has been increasingly recognised as a possible consequence of regular use of the drug, even if the severity and consequences may appear less serious than those commonly found with some other psychoactive substances.
Nevertheless, due to the relatively larger proportion of the population using cannabis regularly, the overall impact of intensive forms of cannabis use on public health may be significant.
Analysis of national population survey data for the United States reveals that around 20–30% of daily users scored positive for dependence between 2000 and 2006 (44).
In an Australian study, 92% of long-term cannabis users were classified as having been dependent at some point in their life, with more than half of them judged to be dependent at the time of the study.
A follow-up study carried out one year later suggested that, among long-term users, measures of cannabis use and dependence may be stable for this length of time (Swift et al., 2000).
Only Sweden and Norway report a series of surveys of young people or conscripts dating back to the 1970s.
A first wave of use was observed in the 1970s, followed by a decline in the 1980s and a new substantial increase during the 1990s.
Analysis of year of initiation in recent surveys also identified substantial cannabis use expansion in Spain (mid-1970s) and Germany (early 1990s) (see the 2004 and 2007 annual reports).
The EMCDDA is developing, in collaboration with several countries, methods for monitoring the more intensive and significant long-term forms of cannabis use, including dependence.
Psychometric scales are being tested in several EU countries and the available evidence will be analysed this year.

Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe school students.
A comparison of HBSC data of 2001/02 and 2005/06 shows a stable or decreasing trend in both lifetime and other more frequent cannabis use among 15-year-old school students in most EU countries (49).
Other recent national school surveys conducted in Spain, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden and the UnitedKingdom also report stable or decreasing trends.
markedly during the 1990s, in particular among young people (Figure 4) and school students.
Around the year 2000, lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among the 15–34 age group increased to levels in excess of 30% in nine countries and around 40% in two cases, while last year prevalence reached 15–20% in seven countries and last month prevalence 8–15% in six countries.
Of particular interest is the trend in cannabis use in the UnitedKingdom (England and Wales), the country that reported the highest prevalence estimates in Europe in the early and mid1990s, but where more recently a steady downward trend has been observed, particularly among the 16–24 age group (47).
Information from recent national surveys suggests that cannabis use is stabilising in many countries.
Of the 16 countries for which it is possible to analyse the trend from 2001 and 2006, last year prevalence among young adults increased by 15% or more in six countries, decreased in three by a similar amount and was stable in seven (48).
Stable or decreasing trends are also evident from the most recently published data on cannabis use among
As cannabis availability in Europe as a whole does not seem to have changed and prices seem to be decreasing in most countries providing information, an explanation for the current stabilisation or decrease has to be found elsewhere.
The 2005 French population survey Baromètre sante noted that among those who had stopped using cannabis, 80% cited a lack of interest as the reason for quitting.
Part of the explanation may also be found in the observed reduction in tobacco smoking, which shares the same route of administration as cannabis and the behaviour may, therefore, be associated at some level (Reitox national reports and Currie et al., 2008).

Chapter 3: Cannabis
Those seeking treatment in outpatient settings for primary cannabis use also report using other drugs: 21% report using alcohol as a secondary substance, 12% amphetamines and ecstasy, and 10% cocaine. Among those receiving treatment for other primary drugs, cannabis is reported as the second most frequently cited secondary substance (21%) after alcohol (32%) (54).
Decreases in experimental or occasional use of cannabis are not necessarily directly related to trends in the regular use of the drug.
In 2006, among 390 000 reported treatment demands (data available from 24 countries), cannabis was the primary reason for entering treatment in about 21% of all cases, making it the second most reported drug after heroin (50
Among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment (data available from 24 countries) reported in 2006, cannabis clients represent the second largest group (28%), after heroin clients (34%).
The absolute number of new demands for cannabis treatment increased over the period 2002–06, while the proportion of new clients entering treatment for primary cannabis use increased between 2002 and 2005 and remained at the same level in 2006 (55).

There are also considerable variations regarding new treatment demands, with cannabis being cited as the primary drug by less than 10% of new clients in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Romania and by more than 50%

Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Overall, primary cannabis users entering treatment can be divided in to three groups, in terms of frequency of use: those who use it occasionally (30%), those using it once to several times a week (30%) and those using it daily (40%) (57).
However, considerable differences are observed between countries, particularly in the proportion of regular cannabis users entering treatment.
In those countries where cannabis clients are more numerous, the proportion of daily users varies from over 70% in the Netherlands and Denmark, to 40–60% in Spain, France and Italy, and 20–30% in Germany and Hungary.
In France, about 250 cannabis consultation centres, providing counselling and support to users and their families, have been set up throughout the country since 2005.
In Denmark, special funds have recently been allocated for the development of targeted programmes for young cannabis users.
In addition, Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland are collaborating in an international study of the effectiveness of a comprehensive family-based treatment for problematic cannabis use (Incant) (58).
In Germany, there are attempts to transfer the Internet- based cannabis cessation programme ‘Quit the shit’ (59), which provides interactive counselling in collaboration with outpatient treatment facilities, to municipal structures of youth welfare and drug care or facilities of drug dependence prevention.
A survey commissioned by the EMCDDA on the provision of cannabis treatment in a sample of drug treatment services in 19 Member States found that half of the surveyed services did not have programmes specifically dedicated to cannabis problems (EMCDDA, 2008a).
This finding suggests that many cannabis users are treated within the same settings as the users of other drugs, which may present difficulties, both to treatment staff and to clients.
The use of information and communications technology in drug demand reduction interventions continues to grow in Europe. In 2006/07, the availability of counselling and advice on drug use was mentioned by nine Member States, with eight reporting the use of the Internet (Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Netherlands, Portugal, Austria, Slovakia, United Kingdom), while Denmark reported the use of SMS.
These Internetbased services are targeted at young people and focus on problems related to alcohol and cannabis.
Of the specialist services surveyed, most offered short courses of treatment for cannabis use of usually less than 20 sessions.
Treatment generally took the form of individual counselling and therapy or counselling about the possible implications of cannabis use.
Some agencies reported cannabis detoxification, family therapy, therapeutic community and mutual help groups as possible components of treatment.
Use of residential care for cannabis treatment when provided was generally in the context of socio-behavioural problems respite.
The scientific literature in this area suggests that a number of psychotherapies have been shown to be effective for cannabis treatment, including motivational therapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy, but no form of psychotherapy has been found to be more effective than any other (Nordstrom and Levin, 2007).
Although most studies on the efficacy of cannabis treatment have been carried out in the United States and Australia, European studies are now beginning to be launched or reported.
Cannabis is the illicit drug most often mentioned in police reports for drug law offences (60) in Europe, and offences related to this drug in the European Union have increased by an average of 34% between 2001 and 2006 (Figure 2).
The available data show that the majority of reported cannabis offences are related to use and possession for use rather than to trafficking and supply; with use-related offences in the majority of reporting countries accounting for 62–95% of all reported cannabis offences.
Chapter 3: Cannabis further development of drug use and re-offending, and may include family, school or psychological counselling.
With many drug law offenders being young cannabis users, who might otherwise not come in to contact with drug services, there have been reports of increasing cooperation between judicial authorities and prevention and counselling services in schools and youth welfare facilities.
Germany, Spain (Catalonia), Luxembourg and Austria have implemented protocols and programmes for young people breaking drug laws or who have been convicted for the use or possession of drugs, mostly cannabis.
The offender may be given the choice of completing a course, instead of paying a fine.
The programmes offered in the various countries aim to prevent
A follow-up evaluation of the German FReD programmes for young offenders (100 respondents) found that 44% of the ex-participants reduced their use of alcohol and tobacco, 79% reduced or stopped the consumption of illicit drugs and 69% reported no re-offending since concluding the course.
An evaluation of the similar youth offending teams (YOT) in the UnitedKingdom found that this approach had considerable potential benefits (Matrix Research, 2007).
Smoking bans and cannabis regulatory tobacco policies could favourably influence perceived norms, which are predictors for both tobacco and cannabis use.
The possible links between tobacco policies and cannabis smoking is an issue meriting attention.
Smoking bans are becoming more widespread in Europe, and nine Member States now have full smoking bans (public and workplaces including restaurants and bars) in place, and Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal have recently introduced at least partial smoking bans.
There is also some evidence that cannabis is an economic complement (i.e. responding in the same direction to price and availability) to cigarettes (Cameron and Williams, 2001).
Isolated studies found that higher cigarette taxes appear to decrease the intensity of marijuana use and may have a modest negative effect on the probability of use among males (Farrelly et al., 2001).
The link between tobacco use and later illicit drug use tends to fall away when adjusting for underlying risk factors, as has been shown by a review of prospective studies (Mathers et al., 2006).
However, in Europe, cannabis use is more prevalent among tobacco smokers than among non-smokers and strong
Finally, it is worth noting that the Dutch ban on smoking tobacco in restaurants and bars applies also to coffee shops, and that the city of Amsterdam has decided to ban cannabis smoking in public.
Chapter 4 Amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD
Amphetamine and methamphetamine are central nervous system stimulants.
Of the two drugs, amphetamine is by far the more commonly available in Europe, whereas significant methamphetamine use appears to be restricted to the CzechRepublic and Slovakia.
Globally, after cannabis, amphetamines (a generic term that includes both amphetamine and methamphetamine) and ecstasy are among the most commonly consumed illicit drugs.
In Europe today, in terms of the absolute numbers, cocaine use may be higher, but the geographic concentration of cocaine in a few countries means that for most of the European Union, some form of synthetically produced drug remains the second most commonly used illicit substance.
Moreover, in parts of Europe, use of amphetamines constitutes an important part of the drug problem, accounting for a substantial proportion of those in need of treatment.
Ecstasy refers to synthetic substances that are chemically related to amphetamines, but which differ to some extent in their effects.
The best-known member of the ecstasy group of drugs is 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), but other analogues are also sometimes found in ecstasy tablets (MDA, MDEA).
Ecstasy use was virtually unknown in Europe before the late 1980s, but increased dramatically during the 1990s.
Its popularity has historically been linked with the dance-music scene and, in general, synthetic drug use at high prevalence is associated with particular cultural sub-groups or social settings.
Consumption estimates of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), by far the most widely known hallucinogenic drug, have been low and somewhat stable for a considerable time in Europe.
However, there appears to be a growing interest among young people in naturally occurring hallucinogenic substances.
On the illicit drugs market, the main representatives of the amphetamines group are amphetamine and methamphetamine (and their salts) — two closely related synthetic substances, members of the phenethylamine family.
Both substances are central nervous system stimulants, sharing the same mechanism of action, and having similar behavioural effects, tolerance, withdrawal and prolonged (chronic) use effects.
Amphetamine is less potent than methamphetamine, but in uncontrolled situations the effects are almost indistinguishable.
Amphetamine and methamphetamine products mostly consist of powders, but ‘ice’, the pure crystalline hydrochloride salt of methamphetamine is also used.
Tablets containing either amphetamine or methamphetamine may carry logos similar to those seen on MDMA and other ecstasy tablets.
Given the physical forms in which they are available, amphetamine and methamphetamine may be ingested, snorted, inhaled and, less commonly, injected.
Unlike the sulphate salt of amphetamine, methamphetamine hydrochloride, particularly the crystalline form (‘ice’), is sufficiently volatile to be smoked.

Methamphetamine major producer and consumer of this drug (CND, 2008; UNODC, 2008).
Most amphetamine seized in Europe is produced, in order of importance, in the Netherlands, Poland and Belgium, and to a lesser extent in Estonia and Lithuania.
In 2006, 40 sites involved in the production, packaging or storage of amphetamines were discovered in the European Union (Europol, 2007a); and the UNODC (2008) reports that 123 laboratories were dismantled in European countries.
Production of methamphetamine is concentrated in North America and east and south-east Asia. In 2006, global production of methamphetamine was estimated at 266 tonnes, exceeding that of any of other illicit synthetic drug.
About 15.8 tonnes of methamphetamine was recovered worldwide in 2006, most of which was seized in east and south-east Asia, followed by North America, and less than 1% of seizures originating from Europe (UNODC, 2007a, 2008).
International action against the manufacture and diversion of synthetic drug precursors
Turkey reported seizures of about 20 million amphetamine tablets with the logo ‘Captagon’.
Production of amphetamine in this form is reported in both Bulgaria and Turkey, and is thought to be largely intended for exportation to consumer countries in the Near and Middle East.
Law enforcement efforts increasingly target the precursor chemicals necessary for illicit drug production as an additional counter-measure, and this area is one in which international cooperation is particularly valuable.
Project Prism is an international initiatives et up to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of synthetic drugs, through a system of preexport notifications for licit trade and the reporting of shipments stopped and seizures made when suspicious transactions occur.
Information on activities in this area are reported to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB, 2008b).
In Europe, an estimated 38 000 seizures amounting to 6.2 tonnes of amphetamine powder were made in 2006.
While the provisional figures for 2006 suggest a decline from the higher levels reported in 2004 and 2005, both seizures and the amount of amphetamines intercepted have increased over the five-year period 2001–06 (63).
However, this conclusion is provisional as the most recent data from the United Kingdom, the country in Europe which typically reports the most seizures, are not yet available.
Seizures of amphetamine tablets, as opposed to powder, are increasingly being reported by a few countries, with a total of 390 000 tablets seized in the European Union (mostly in Spain) in 2006.
Globally, reports suggest that over 11 tonnes of ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine, key precursors of methamphetamine, were seized in 2006.
China accounted for around half of this total followed by Canada and Myanmar.
EU Member States (mainly Belgium and Hungary) together with the Russian Federation and Ukraine accounted for only 0.3 tonnes, although Europol (2008) reports a recent increase in the exportation, transhipment and diversion of these chemicals in the European Union.
Global seizures of 1-phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P), which can be used for the illicit manufacture of both amphetamine and methamphetamine, declined in 2006. An exception to this trend was the EU Member States (mainly Denmark, Netherlands, Poland) along with Turkey and the Russian Federation, which together accounted for most of the global seizures of 2 600 litres of P-2-P.
This precursor is predominantly used for amphetamine production in Europe with manufacturers typically sourcing P-2-P from Asian countries (China), although since 2004 it has also reported to have been sourced and trafficked from the Russian Federation (Europol, 2007a).
The purity of amphetamine samples intercepted in Europe in 2006 varied considerably and to such an extent that any comment on typical values must be made with caution.
Nevertheless, countries reporting data for 2006 can be divided in to two groups, with 10 countries reporting values of between 2% and 10% and the others reporting higher purity levels (25–47%).
This latter group typically included those countries known for having greater involvement with the production, trafficking or consumption of amphetamine (Netherlands, Poland, Baltic and Nordic countries).
Over the past five years, the purity of amphetamine has been stable or falling in most of those 19 countries where sufficient data are available to allow an analysis.
Global seizures of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone (3,4-MDP-2-P), used to manufacture MDMA, decreased in 2006 to 7 500 litres, of which Canada accounted for all except 105 litres seized by the Netherlands.
Seizures of safrole, which may replace 3,4-MDP-2-P in the synthesis of MDMA, remained marginal in 2006, with 62 litres seized worldwide, mostly in Australia; in Europe, only France reported a seizure of safrole (7 litres).
In 2006, the typical retail price of amphetamine varied between EUR 10 and EUR 15 a gram in half of the reporting countries.
Over the period 2001–06, with the exception of the Czech Republic, Spain and Romania, the retail price of amphetamine was reported to have fallen in all 16 countries reporting sufficient data for analysis.
The data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR-11 to SZR-18 in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
Note that where data for 2006 are absent, the corresponding data for 2005 are used to estimate European totals.
Chapter 4: Amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD marketed as ecstasy frequently found amphetamine or methamphetamine to be present, often in combination with MDMA or one of its analogues.
In Latvia and Malta, most tablets analysed did not contain any controlled substance.
Illicit production of methamphetamine does occur in Europe, though it is largely limited to the Czech Republic, where over 400 small-scale ‘kitchen laboratories’ were detected in 2006.
The drug is also reported to be produced in Slovakia and, to a lesser extent, Lithuania (INCB, 2008a).
About 3 000 seizures of methamphetamine amounting to 154 kg of the drug were reported in 17 European countries in 2006.
Norway accounts for most seizures and amounts recovered, followed by Sweden, the CzechRepublic and Slovakia.
In the latter two countries, seizures tended to be small, usually of a few grams or less.
Between 2001 and 2006, both the number and the quantity of methamphetamine seized in Europe have been increasing; though still remaining low in comparison to other drugs.
In 2006, the limited data available suggest that the typical purity of methamphetamine fell somewhere between 20% and 55%.
Most countries reported that the typical MDMA content of ecstasy tablets was somewhere between 25 and 65 mg — although there was considerable variation in the samples analysed (9–90 mg).
In addition, high-dose ecstasy tablets containing over 130 mg of MDMA were reported by some countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Netherlands, Norway) and high-quality MDMA powder has now become available in some markets.
No clear medium-term trend is observable in the MDMA content of ecstasy tablets.
It is clear, however, that in comparison to when the drug first became widely available in Europe in the early 1990s, ecstasy has become considerably cheaper.
Although there are some reports of tablets being sold for as little as EUR 1, most countries now report typical retail prices in the range of EUR 3–9 per tablet, and the data available for 2001–06 suggest that the retail price (adjusted for inflation) has continued to fall.
Global ecstasy production is reported by the UNODC (2007a) to have fallen to around 102 tonnes in 2006.
Production appears to have become more geographically diffuse, with manufacture for local consumption now more common in North America and east and south-east Asia.
Despite this, Europe remains the main location for ecstasy production, with manufacture concentrated in the Netherlands (where, after a few years of decline, production may have increased again in 2006), Belgium and, to a lesser extent, Poland and the United Kingdom.
LSD use and trafficking is still considered marginal, although seizures in Europe are possibly suggestive of a revival in interest in the drug in the last few years.
After a long-term downward trend dating back to the 1990s, both the number and the quantity of seizures have been increasing since 2003.
The current situation is unclear, as although the data provisionally available indicates a slight decline in both measures, the United Kingdom, the country that usually reports the greatest quantities of LSD seized, has not yet reported.
LSD retail prices (adjusted for inflation) have been slightly declining since 2001, and ranged in 2006 between EUR 5 and EUR 11 per unit in most European countries.
Prevalence and patterns of use
The relative importance of Europe as both a consumer and producer of ecstasy can be seen from the data on drug seizures.
Europe reported over 20 000 seizures resulting in the interception of nearly 14 million ecstasy tablets in 2006.
The Netherlands accounted for the largest quantity of ecstasy seized (4.1 million tablets), followed by the United Kingdom, Turkey, France and Germany.
Overall, the number of ecstasy seizures has decreased over the period 2001–06, and the quantity seized has also declined, after a peak year in 2002 (64).
Of the 4.5 tonnes of ecstasy seized worldwide in 2006, western and central Europe accounted for 43%; as a point of comparison, North America accounted for 34% (UNODC, 2008).
In contrast, overall, consumption levels of synthetic hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are lower and have been largely stable for a considerable period.
In Europe, most ecstasy tablets analysed in 2006 contained MDMA or another ecstasy-like substance (MDEA, MDA) as the only psychoactive substance present, with 17 countries reporting that this was the case in over 70% of the total number of tablets analysed.
Higher prevalence levels in some countries need to be understood in the context of, in simple terms at least, two distinct consumption patterns. In a limited number of
This picture is preliminary as data for the United Kingdom, the country reporting the most seizures in 2005, are not yet available for 2006.
The European stimulant market: ‘cocaine countries’ and ‘amphetamines countries’?
data from general population surveys and reports of seizures suggests that northern and central European countries generally tend to belong to an ‘amphetamines group’, while in the countries in the west and south of Europe, cocaine use largely predominates.
A synthesis of information from a variety of sources suggests that different stimulant drugs may play a similar role in different countries and, therefore, it may be wise when developing policy in this area to consider not only the individual substances but also the stimulant market as a whole.
In some countries, cocaine appears to be the dominant stimulant drug, while in others, amphetamine or methamphetamine appear more commonly used. The picture that emerges from combining

Chapter 4: Amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD countries, stimulant drugs are responsible for a relatively high proportion of all demands for drug treatment (methamphetamine in the CzechRepublic and Slovakia; amphetamine in Latvia, Sweden and Finland; and cocaine in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands); while elsewhere, the proportion of treatment clients reporting any of these substances as their main reason for seeking help is very low, and sometimes even negligible.
countries, the use, often by injection, of amphetamine or methamphetamine accounts for a substantial proportion of the overall number of problem drug users and those seeking help for drug problems.
In contrast to these chronic populations, a more general association exists between synthetic drugs, ecstasy in particular, and nightclubs, dance music and some sub-cultures; this results in significantly higher levels of use being reported among young people, compared with the general population, and exceedingly high levels of use being found in some settings or specific sub-populations.
Data from treatment clients also suggests that those being treated for problems caused by stimulant drugs tend to be experiencing problems with only one class of stimulants.
For example, among those receiving treatment for cocaine in outpatient settings (all demands), only around 8% reported amphetamines as their secondary drug; while among amphetamine clients, less than 9% reported cocaine as a secondary problem drug.
Moreover, reports from some countries suggest that one stimulant can sometimes displace another on the drugs market.
For example, data exists to suggest that: cocaine may be replacing amphetamines and ecstasy among some drug-using populations; and, in the Netherlands, amphetamines may be used as a cheaper substitute for cocaine outside of urban areas.
Recent population surveys indicate that lifetime prevalence of the use of amphetamines (65) in Europe varies between countries, from 0.1% to 11.9% of all adults (15–64 years).
On average, 3.3% of all European adults report having used amphetamines at least once.
Use of the drug in the last year is much lower, with a European average of 0.6% (range 0.0–1.3%).
The estimates suggest that around 11 million Europeans have tried amphetamines, and about 2 million have used the drug in the last year (see Table 3 for a summary of the data).
Among young adults (15–34 years), lifetime prevalence of amphetamine use varies considerably between countries, from 0.2% to 16.5%, with a European average of about 5%.
Last year use of amphetamines in this age group ranges from 0.1% to 2.9%, with the majority of countries reporting prevalence estimates of between 0.7% and 1.9%.
It is estimated that, on average, 1.3% of young Europeans have used amphetamines in the last year.
While stimulant drugs may differ in their effects and consequences, in respect to drug treatment the options, rates of retention and outcomes are broadly similar (Rawson et al., 2000; Copeland and Sorensen, 2001).
To some extent, similarities can also be seen in patterns by which these drugs are used and in the overall typology of users.
For example, recreational and less intensive and damaging patterns of use among socially wellintegrated users can coexist with intensive use among more marginalised groups, with greater association with dependence problems and more risky modes of administration, such as injection and smoking.
The EMCDDA indicator on problem drug use (PDU) can be used in a restricted sense for amphetamines, where it defines as such the injecting or long duration/regular use of the substance.
Only one Member State (Finland) has provided a recent national estimate of problem amphetamine use, which in 2005 was estimated to amount to between 12000 and 22000 problem amphetamine users (4.3 to 7.9 casesper1000 , aged 15–54 years), about four times the estimated number of problem opioid users in the country.
The background colour indicates the relative dominance of cocaine or amphetamines according to general population surveys (prevalence of use in the last year among the population aged 15–34) and data on seizures; pie charts represent the proportions of all drug treatment requests accounted for by these two drugs — only segments representing cocaine and amphetamines are displayed.
For Italy, the Netherlands and Poland, where data on seizures were unavailable, only data from population surveys were used.
For Croatia, only seizures data were used.
For Norway and Belgium treatment data were unavailable.
The data available for Romania did not permit inferences to be made for the country as a whole.
In the CzechRepublic and Slovakia, methamphetamine is the amphetamine most commonly used.
Survey data on ‘amphetamine use’ often do not distinguish between amphetamine and methamphetamine, though, typically this will be related to the use of amphetamine (sulphate or dexamphetamine), as use of methamphetamine is uncommon in Europe, with less than 1% of world methamphetamine seizures reported from this continent.

found for other drugs (68).
In most countries, though not in Sweden and Finland, the proportion of new clients entering treatment for primary amphetamine use is greater than the proportion of all clients receiving treatment for this drug.
From 2002 to 2006, the proportion of new clients entering treatment for primary amphetamine use has been relatively stable in Europe as a whole, though over this period an increase has
In contrast to other parts of the world, where the use of methamphetamine has increased in recent years, levels of its use in Europe appear limited (Griffiths et al., 2008).
Historically, use of this drug in Europe has been concentrated in the CzechRepublic and, to some extent,

Chapter 4: Amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD estimate at 0.3% and the highest at 12%, reflecting the different experiences of some Member States.
Only these two countries report recent estimates of problem use.
In 2006, in the CzechRepublic there were estimated to be approximately 17 500–22 500 methamphetamine users (2.4 to 3.1 casesper1000 aged 15–64 years), almost twice the estimated number of problem opioid users; and in Slovakia, approximately 6 200–15 500 methamphetamine users (1.6 to 4.0 casesper1000 aged 15–64 years), around 20% fewer than the estimated number of problem opioid users.
Among school students, large increases in prevalence levels may occur with small increases in age, for example data available from 16 countries show that, compared to younger students, lifetime prevalence of ecstasy use among 17- to 18-year-old school students is generally considerably higher, suggesting that first use of the drug commonly takes place after the age of 16 (71).
In the last five years, the reported demand for treatment related to methamphetamine use has been increasing in both countries.
Methamphetamine has become the primary drug most often reported by those requesting treatment for the first time in Slovakia, where it accounts for 25% of all drug treatment requests.
In the Czech Republic, 59% of all drug treatment clients report methamphetamine as their primary drug (69).
Clients in treatment for methamphetamine report high rates of injecting drug use: around 50% in Slovakia and 80% in the Czech Republic.
Despite the number of ecstasy users in Europe being similar to that of amphetamine, very few are seen by treatment services.
In 2006, in most countries, less than 1% of drug users entering treatment mentioned ecstasy as their primary problem drug and in most countries only a trivial number of clients are being treated for ecstasyrelated problems.
Only five countries report having more than 100 ecstasy clients entering treatment (France, Italy, Hungary, United Kingdom, Turkey), representing between 0.5% and 4% of all drug clients in these countries.
With an average age of 24–25 years, users of ecstasy are among the youngest groups entering drug treatment and regularly report the concomitant use of other substances, including cannabis, cocaine, alcohol and amphetamines (72).
It is estimated that about 9.5 million European adults have tried ecstasy (3% on average) and that about 3 million (0.8%) have used it in the last year (see Table 4 for a summary of the data).
Use of the drug in the last year varied across Europe, from 0.2% to 3.5%.
On all measures, and as with most other illicit drugs, reported use was far higher among males than among females.
Among young adults (15–34 years), lifetime prevalence estimates area little higher (0.3% to 7.1%), although lower prevalence levels are reported among the 15- to 24-year-olds.
Amphetamine use (last 12 months) among young adults (15–34 ) in the UnitedKingdom declined substantially between 1996 (6.5%) and 2002 (3.1%), with the figures remaining
Ecstasy consumption was more common among young adults (15–34 years), where lifetime prevalence estimates ranged at national level from 0.5% to 14.6%, with between 0.4% and 7.7% of this age group reporting using the drug in the last year.
See Table TDI-5 (part ii) in the 2008 statistical bulletin.

Data from a few countries suggest that cocaine could be replacing amphetamines and ecstasy among some sectors of the drug-using population. This may be the
In Denmark in 1994 the information refers to ‘hard drugs’, which was considered mainly amphetamines.
Chapter 4: Amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD reported by males than females: 42% and 27%, respectively (European Commission, 2007b).
A French survey carried out in 2004 and 2005 at five electronic music venues reported last month prevalence of 32% for ecstasy and 13% for amphetamine among a sample of 1496 respondents.
However, it should be noted that prevalence was higher among specific subpopulations that were characterised by their countercultural elements and labelled as ‘alternative’.
Among these sub-populations, prevalence estimates for ecstasy and amphetamine were 54% and 29% respectively.
Interventions in recreational settings case in the UnitedKingdom and Denmark, and to some extent in Spain.
Both the UnitedKingdom and Denmark report relatively high lifetime prevalence estimates for the use of amphetamines at 11.9% and 6.9% respectively, but levels of reported use in the last year and last month are more in line with those found in other countries.
Increases in cocaine consumption in these countries have been matched to some extent by a decrease in the use of amphetamines, raising the possibility that one stimulant drug is replacing another in these markets (77).
Possible changes in the patterns of drug use in other countries (Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands) are less clear.
Overall, the interplay between different drugs that may have similar appeal to users remains poorly understood.
An analysis of data from those national school surveys newly available in 2007 (Czech Republic, Spain, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, UnitedKingdom ) supports the suggestion of an overall stabilisation in the situation with no change or even some decrease noted in reported lifetime use of both amphetamine and ecstasy.
Recreational settings
Use of amphetamines and ecstasy in recreational settings
An increasingly common trend reported in Europe is for authorities to address aspects of licit and illicit drugs collectively when considering local public order or health issues.
This approach is particularly relevant to interventions targeting settings where both synthetic and stimulant drugs and alcohol are consumed, such as night bars and clubs.
One of the problems in this area is that the relative roles of illicit and licit substances may be difficult to distinguish.
The use of alcohol among young people is a growing area of concern in Europe, and in 2006 the European Commission adopted an EU alcohol strategy to support Member States in reducing alcoholrelated harm among young people.
Indeed, harmful use of alcohol is associated with one in every four deaths among young men (aged 15–29) and one in 10 among young women (79).
Studies of drug use in selected recreational settings where young people congregate and which are known to be sometimes associated with drug use, such as dance events or music festivals, can provide a useful window on the behaviour of those using amphetamines and ecstasy on a regular and intensive basis.
Estimates of drug use in these settings are typically high, but are not generalisable to the wider population.
Concerns about the combined use of drugs and alcohol by young people in public settings have led to the development of strategies that aim to alter the social, economic and physical environments associated with alcohol and drug consumption, with the goals of: modifying consumption behaviours and norms; creating conditions less favourable to intoxication; and reducing opportunities for alcohol and drugrelated problems to occur (80).
This level of drunkenness was more commonly

Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe to medical emergencies.
Often, a common feature of this approach is that it is based upon a dialogue between different stakeholders, such as the police, licensing authorities, club owners and healthcare providers, who are required to work together in partnership to identify both local needs and possible solutions.
improving public safety, with benefits that can extend beyond those using drugs and in to the wider community.
However, today in Europe, such approaches tend to be limited to particular known problem areas, often in major city centres, and are rarely comprehensively implemented, strongly suggesting that there is considerable potential for further investment and development in this area.
More generally, the focus of work in this area has tended to be restricted to interventions targeting specific problematic behaviours, or aspects of the environment, rather than the broader task of addressing the normative beliefs and attitudes that young people have towards the use of drugs and alcohol in specific settings.
An example of work in this area can be found in Denmark where, in cooperation with municipal authorities and the police, restaurant owners and people working in the nightlife environment are offered courses to promote shared attitudes on limiting the use and sale of drugs and alcohol.
Some approaches in this area developed by individual Member States are also beginning to attract wider attention, as illustrated by the fact that the safe-dance guidelines developed in the UnitedKingdom have now been implemented in clubs in both Paris and Brussels.
Club owners, with the participation of outreach workers and local authorities, help promote moderate drinking, raising awareness of the harms of drugs and alcohol, while raising the safety characteristics of settings (e.g. providing free water, staff trained in first aid, chill-out areas).
In most Member States, limited demand is reflected in the limited availability of treatment services specifically targeting users of amphetamine, methamphetamine or ecstasy.
This situation is somewhat different in a few Member States with long-established chronic amphetamine- or methamphetamine-using populations.
In these countries (principally the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden), users of amphetamine or methamphetamine are treated within specialist services.
Treatment options appear to consist of detoxification, followed by individual therapy in an outpatient setting or group therapy in either outpatient or residential settings.
The relationship between driving and drug and alcohol consumption has been an issue included in some environmental strategies.
Examples here include the provision of alternative transportation for intoxicated drivers, which is available in some Parisian nightclubs, and the promotion of public transport options by clubs in Brussels.
In Spain, prevention campaigns that focus on ‘designated drivers’ and on raising awareness of the risks of driving under the influence of psychoactive substances have been conducted, particularly during weekends. These campaigns may have contributed to the 16% decrease observed in Spain in the number of traffic accidents involving young people aged 18–20, in 2006 (81).
Strategies that address the environment in which young people consume both drugs and alcohol appear to have considerable potential for safeguarding public health and
Therapeutic options with robust evidence of effectiveness are generally lacking to guide the treatment of dependence on psychostimulants, such as amphetamines and cocaine.
As noted in Chapter 5, no pharmacological agents are currently available to help users to manage abstinence or reduce the cravings associated with psychostimulant dependence.
Furthermore, the literature would suggest that no particular psychosocial intervention has shown strong evidence of effectiveness in helping psychostimulant users to maintain abstinence.

Chapter 5 Cocaine and crack cocaine
994 tonnes of pure cocaine hydrochloride for the year 2007, of which Colombia accounted for 61%, Peru 29% and Bolivia 10%.
Analysis of the number of laboratories dismantled suggests that most production remains located in these three countries, although it may also occur in other South American countries, before exportation to the main consumer markets in North America and Europe.
Information on illicit trafficking in potassium permanganate (a chemical reagent used in the synthesis of cocaine hydrochloride) supports this finding, with Colombia reporting 99 of the 101 tonnes of permanganate potassium seized globally in 2006 (INCB, 2008b).
The most recent data continues to point to an overall increase in the use of cocaine in Europe.
Population surveys carried out in a numberofcountries have recorded a marked increase in use among young people since the mid-1990s. These findings are supported by the results of targeted studies, which have observed very high levels of cocaine use in some recreational settings (nightlife and dance-music venues).
In parallel, indicators of cocaine availability in Europe, including the number of seizures of the drug and the amount seized, have increased dramatically.
In some EU Member States, the demand for treatment for cocaine use has increased substantially in recent years, and now even exceeds that for opioid treatment in some countries, cities and regions.
Moreover, a substantial proportion of opioid users in treatment report cocaine as their secondary drug, which may be contributing to their problems and can complicate their care.
In many countries, cocaine is also reported in the toxicological analysis of a high proportion of drugrelated deaths, generally in combination with opioids and other substances.
Cocaine produced in the Andean region is then smuggled to Europe from South American countries (via Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela).
While the Caribbean continues to be an important transit zone for cocaine heading to Europe, transhipment via countries in west Africa, in particular in the Gulf of Guinea and off the coasts of Cape Verde, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, has been increasing markedly during the past few years (CND, 2008; INCB, 2008a) (83).
Spain and Portugal remain the major entry points of cocaine in to Europe, the latter’s role having substantially increased since 2005.
Cocaine continues, however, also to enter Europe more directly either by shipment across the Atlantic or by air; in particular to the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, France, the UnitedKingdom and Germany.
Both the Netherlands and France are reported to be major transit countries for further cocaine distribution in Europe (Europol, 2007b).
Recent reports of cocaine importation via east European countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Russia) may point to the development of new trafficking routes in this part of Europe.
Supply and availability
Cultivation of coca bush, the source of cocaine, continues to be concentrated in a few countries in the Andean region (82
Cocaine is the most trafficked drug in the world after herbal cannabis and cannabis resin.
In 2006, global seizures of cocaine decreased slightly to 706 tonnes.
Crime (2008) estimated potential cocaine production at
For information on the sources of data for drug supply and availability, see p.36.
West Africa: now a regional transit hub for trafficking to Europe amount seized in Portugal since 2005, accounting for 28% of the European total in 2006, points to the growing use of the Iberian peninsula by cocaine traffickers as an entry point to the European market.
Purity and price
The typical purity of cocaine in Europe ranged between 1% and 90% in 2006, although most countries reported values between 25% and 55% (85). Of the 23 countries
In the last five years, west Africa has emerged as an important region in cocaine trafficking to Europe (1), acting as a site of transit, storage and repackaging (Europol, 2007b; UNODC 2007b; USDS, 2008).
It is estimated that almost a quarter of the cocaine trafficked to Europe in 2007 was transited via this region (UNODC, 2008).
Against a background of increasing cocaine use in Europe, the growth in trafficking via the west African route is thought to have contributed to the decline in the price of the drug, while reinforcing the role of the Iberian peninsula as an entry point for cocaine distribution in Europe (Europol, 2007b).
Cocaine is trafficked from west Africa to Europe mainly by sea, with large shipments transported by fishing vessels to unloading sites mainly on the coast of northern Portugal and Galicia in Spain.
Smaller shipments of cocaine are trafficked by air or overland, increasingly associated with smuggling cannabis resin from north Africa.
In 2006, the typical retail price of cocaine varied between EUR 50 and EUR 75 per gram in most European countries, although Cyprus, Romania, Sweden and Turkey reported much higher values.
Over the period 2001–06, cocaine sold on the streets has become cheaper in the 18 countries reporting sufficient data, with the exception of Romania, where an increase in price (adjusted for inflation) was noted.
The growth of the west African cocaine trafficking route has been attributed to several factors.
These include more effective controls on alternative trafficking routes (Europol, 2007b); the geographical position of west Africa; and the economic vulnerabilities of countries in this area, often resulting in weak judicial and law enforcement systems.
Among other initiatives taken by the European Union, the Council, through the horizontal working party on drugs, has placed west Africa at the top of the agenda and presented a resolution on the strengthening of international support to west Africa to the 2008 UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs.
Furthermore, seven Member States, with EU support, have acted together to establish the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre–Narcotics (MAOC-N), a law enforcement centre, located in Lisbon, with military support, that aims to suppress cocaine trafficking, with special focus on the eastern part of the Atlantic.
(1) UNODC (2007b) reports that Senegal, Ghana, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Nigeria, Benin and Sierra Leone registered the largest seizures in 2006/07.
Patterns of cocaine use can be correspondingly diverse, ranging from the occasional and recreational to the highly compulsive and dependent.
The form that cocaine is used in (cocaine hydrochloride or crack cocaine), and the route of administration by which it is used, are additional complicating factors.
This diversity is an important consideration, both for understanding the range of problems that are likely to be associated with different patterns of cocaine use, and also for informing the targeting and development of services for a disparate group of drug users.
Overall, cocaine remains the second most used illicit drug in Europe, after cannabis, although use varies greatly between countries.
It is estimated that around 12 million Europeans have used it at least once in their lifetime; on average 3.6% of adults aged 15–64 years (see Table 5 for a summary of the data). National figures vary from 0.4% to 7.7%, with 12 countries, mostly Member States that have joined the European Union since 2004,
The number of cocaine seizures has been on the increase for the last 20 years in Europe, and continued to rise during the period 2001–06, with the exception of a decrease in 2003.
The quantity of cocaine seized has also been increasing over the last decade, but with regular fluctuations.
In 2006, cocaine seizures in Europe increased to 72 700 cases and the quantity recovered to 121 tonnes (84).
Spain continued to be the country reporting the highest seizures, accounting for 58% of all seizures and 41% of the quantity intercepted in Europe that year. The huge increase in the
The data on European cocaine seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR-9 and SZR-10 in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
Note that across the chapter, where national data for 2006 are absent, the corresponding data for 2005 are used to estimate European totals.
See Tables PPP-3 and PPP-7 in the 2008 statistical bulletin for purity and price data.
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe reporting very low levels of lifetime prevalence among all adults (0.4–1.2%).
Estimating cocaine use by analysing communal wastewater
It is estimated that around 4 million Europeans have used the drug in the last year (1.2% on average), although again national variation between countries is considerable.
This can be seen in results from recent national surveys, which report last year prevalence estimates of between 0.1% and 3%; though only in four countries do levels of use exceed 1%.
The application of recent developments in analytical chemistry to the detection of cocaine in wastewater has introduced a new approach to the monitoring of illicit drug use in the community, known as ‘sewage epidemiology’.
The method involves measuring the levels of breakdown products of illicit drugs excreted in the urine of consumers.
The levels of breakdown products measured in wastewater are then scaled up to calculate consumption of illicit drugs among the population.
In the case of cocaine, the main metabolite excreted in the urine is benzoylecgonine.
As breakdown in the human body of cocaine is the only likely source of benzoylecgonine in wastewater systems, with certain assumptions, it is possible to back-calculate from the amount of the metabolite in the wastewater to the amount of cocaine consumed in the community (although not to the number of consumers).
Overall, cocaine use appears to be concentrated in a few countries, notably Spain and the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent Italy, Denmark and Ireland, while use of the drug is relatively low in most other European countries.
In countries where amphetamines dominate the market in illicit stimulant drugs, estimates of use of cocaine are low in almost all cases; conversely, in most countries where cocaine is the main illicit stimulant, low levels of amphetamine use are reported (86).
Cocaine use is mainly concentrated among young adults (15–34 years).
For instance, of the 4 million Europeans that have used the drug in the last year, around seven out of eight are likely to be young adults.
Sewage epidemiology is still in an early stage of development and, as well as important technical and ethical questions, the information it offers must be integrated in to current research thinking.
These issues are addressed in the new EMCDDA publication on wastewater analysis (EMCDDA, 2008b).
Bringing together experts from a wide range of disciplines, the report concludes that, although further developments are required, sewage epidemiology has potential for drug surveillance at the community level.
The approach could also have potential as a drug surveillance tool to assist public health and law enforcement officials in identifying patterns of drug use across municipalities of varying sizes.
And, because wastewater sampling and analysis can be conducted on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, the data could potentially be used to give a more real-time measure that provides communities with more possibilities for monitoring the impact and effectiveness of prevention and intervention activities.
In Europe, it is estimated that 7.5 million young adults (15–34 years), or an average of 5.4%, have used cocaine at least once in their life.
National figures vary from 0.7% to 12.7%. The European average for last year use of cocaine among this age group is estimated at 2.3% (3.5 million) and for last month use at 1% (1.5 million).
translates in to 2 million 15- to 24-year-olds using the drug in the last year.
Use is particularly high among young males (15–34 years), with last year prevalence of cocaine use between 4% and 7% in Spain, Denmark, Ireland, Italy and the
UnitedKingdom (87).
The female to male prevalence ratio for last year use ranged between 1:1 and 1:13 for young adults in different countries.
Weighted averages for the European Union as a whole suggest that, among cocaine users aged 15–34, the male to female ratio was nearly 4:1 (3.8 males for each female).
Measures of more recent cocaine use (last year and last month) are highest among the 15–24 age group, although this phenomenon is less marked than in the case of cannabis or ecstasy (88
An analysis of data from the British Crime Survey 2003/04 estimated that around 13% of 16- to 29-year-olds who frequently visit pubs or wine bars report last year use of cocaine, compared with 3.7% among less frequent visitors.
Among 30- to 59-year-olds, the figures were 3.1% and 1% respectively.
This supports the findings of more focused studies, which report a different profile for the user of powder cocaine compared to that found for crack cocaine. It is likely that in other countries cocaine use is also associated with similar lifestyle factors.

Problem cocaine use and treatment demand
Studies conducted in recreational settings often report a high prevalence of cocaine use.
For example, a 2006 study in nine European cities (Athens, Berlin, Brno, Palma, Lisbon, Liverpool, Ljubljana, Venice, Vienna), with 1 383 young people aged 15–30 who regularly ‘go out in nightlife settings’, found that 29% reported using the drug at least once and nearly 4% that they used cocaine once a week or more at some point (European Commission, 2007b).
Higher prevalence levels were also reported in a 2004–05 French survey of 1496 individuals interviewed in five different electronic music settings.
Nearly 35% of the sample had used cocaine and 6% crack or freebase cocaine during the last month.
The study also reported differences between sub-populations: last month prevalence was 50% for cocaine use and 13% for crack use among those labelled ‘alternative’, while around a quarter of the more mainstream subpopulations had used cocaine and 2% crack during the last month.
National estimates of problem cocaine use (injection or long duration/regular use) are available only for Spain and Italy, and regional estimates are available for the United Kingdom.
According to the most recent data for Spain, in 2002 there were between 4.5 and 6 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adult population (15–64 years).
Similarly, in Italy, in 2006, there were estimated to be between 3.7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults.
Information for the UnitedKingdom is not directly comparable to that of Spain and Italy, as it is based on crack cocaine use.
In 2004–05, one study estimated the number of problem crack cocaine users in England at 5.7 to 6.4 per 1 000 adult population.
Cocaine use among school students
Cocaine, mainly powder cocaine, was cited as the principal reason for entering drug treatment in Europe in 2006 by about 16% of all treatment clients, corresponding to around 61 000 reported cases in 24
Among school students, overall prevalence levels for cocaine use are much lower than those for cannabis use.
Ever in lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among 15- to 16-year-old school students is 2% or lower in most countries, rising to 4% in Spain and 5% in the UnitedKingdom (89
countries (91).
Cocaine was also reported as a secondary drug by around 18% of all drug outpatient clients (92).
In Spain, recent survey data have shown a significant decrease among 17- to 18-year-old school students.
Elsewhere in Europe, cocaine accounts for between 5% and 10% of all treatment demands (10 countries) or less than 5% (12 countries) (93).
Data from general population surveys suggest high discontinuation rates among cocaine users: in those countries where last year prevalence is above 2%, between 80% and 90% of adults who have used cocaine at least once in their life have not used it during the last month (90).
Only limited information is available on the frequency of cocaine use in Europe. An analysis of the British Crime Survey found that about 20% of those young people (16–24 years) who had used cocaine in the previous year consumed the drug more often than once a month.
A multi-city European study with targeted samples of cocaine users in nine cities (Prinzleve et al., 2004) found

drug type are obviously influenced by changes in demand for treatment by the users of other substances.
International comparisons of the 1990s in Spain, Denmark and the United Kingdom. New data (2005–07 surveys) confirm the rising trend reported already last year in France, Ireland, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, Denmark and Portugal; in Germany, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Finland, a stable prevalence is observed; and in Poland, a decline was reported (Figure 5).
Overall the estimated lifetime prevalence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia, Canada and the USA.
However, at the national level Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Italy and the UnitedKingdom (England and Wales) report higher figures than Australia.
Only the UnitedKingdom (England and Wales) reports a lifetime prevalence estimate that is similar to that of the USA (96). In some respect, this measure can be seen as reflecting the historical development of cocaine problems and the earlier experience of the USA and, in the European context, the United Kingdom, with widespread cocaine use.
The increasing trend in demand for cocaine treatment noted in previous years also appears to be continuing, even if it is disproportionately influenced by a few countries.
Between 2002 and 2006, the proportion of new clients demanding treatment for primary cocaine use grew from 13% to 25%, and the number of reported cases rose from around 13 000 to almost 30 000.
An increase was also observed in the number and proportion of all cocaine clients entering drug treatment: from 22000 clients (13% of all treatment demands) in 2002 to 50 000 (19%) in 2006.
The largest increases were reported by Italy and Spain (95).
The increasing trend in cocaine users entering drug treatment may be related to increases in the prevalence of cocaine use and related problems, but also to other factors (e.g. increase of treatment referrals or interventions specifically targeted to cocaine users); and proportions by cocaine treatment demands in Europe (97). However, it

Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Health problems related to cocaine use should be noted that cocaine treatment also sometimes takes place in private clinics, sometimes on a residential basis, and this form of care is not well represented in the current monitoring system.
Cocaine clients entering outpatient treatment have the highest male to female ratio among drug treatment clients (five men for every woman).
Awareness of the links between cocaine use and illness is often limited, even among medical professionals.
As a result, some cocaine-related problems will go unidentified, and those suffering them may not receive appropriate care.
Underreporting of cocaine problems will impede the understanding of the impact of the drug on public health.
Most cocaine clients report having started using the drug between the ages of 15 and 24 years (99
The risks associated with certain problematic modes of cocaine use are well known and mostly affect recognised groups of users (former or current opioid users, marginalised groups).
Health problems associated with powder cocaine, however, are more likely to go unrecognised and may affect users who might not normally consider themselves at risk.
These problems can be aggravated by existing conditions (e.g. vascular malformations) and risk factors such as smoking or alcohol use.
Many of the deaths attributed to cocaine are produced through these pathologies.
Use of cocaine in combination with alcohol increases blood levels of cocaine by as much as 30%. From a behavioural perspective, cocaine use may facilitate excessive alcohol use by enabling users to drink longer, which in turn may increase the amount of cocaine consumed (Gossop et al., 2006).
The formation of cocaethylene in the liver may also be linked to further possible health risks associated with the combined use of cocaine and alcohol.
Overall, around half (55%) of the cocaine clients are reported as snorting the drug, with nearly a third (32%) smoking it, and a much smaller proportion (9%) injecting the drug (100).
Broadly, two main groups of cocaine users can be identified among those in treatment.
The first of these are typically more socially integrated, reporting stable housing and employment status, and generally report snorting the drug.
The second is a more marginalised group of clients who are typically smoking or injecting cocaine (see EMCDDA, 2006), and more often report using either crack cocaine or the combination of cocaine and heroin.
Crack clients, in particular, commonly live in large cities, belong to ethnic minority groups, and report high levels of unemployment and poor living conditions (101). This problem is small in European terms and is geographically limited, with significant crack cocaine problems limited to a relatively small number of cities.
In 2006, around 8 000 crack cocaine clients (about 2% of all drug clients) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries, although most of them were reported by the UnitedKingdom (102).
There have been few studies to assess the overall public health impact of cocaine use.
A largescale population study in the USA (1988–94) found that a quarter of non-fatal acute myocardial infarctions among those aged 18–45 years were attributed to ‘frequent lifetime cocaine use’.
Frequent users had a seven times higher risk of non-fatal myocardial infarctions than nonusers (Qureshi et al., 2001).
However, it is not possible to generalise directly from this study to Europe.
Currently, our understanding of the possible health impact of increasing cocaine use in Europe remains poorly developed and an important area for future public health inquiry.
For further reading on health problems related to cocaine use, see the 2007 selected issue on cocaine.
In some countries, they represent the largest group of cocaine treatment clients.

Chapter 5: Cocaine and crack cocaine or re-initiation — a risk for HIV and other blood-borne infections and serious medical, social and criminal problems.
Cocaine treatment in treating cocaine dependence, nor do effective pharmacological treatment approaches exist.
A recent Cochrane review on psychosocial cocaine and other psychostimulant interventions concluded that the only consistent, positive behavioural results (retention in treatment, reduction in drug consumption) were observed in psychosocial interventions that included contingency management as a component (103).
Following the increase of cocaine use and associated problems in several Member States, specialised drug treatment facilities face the difficult task of adapting their traditionally opioid-oriented services to the varied cocaine and crack-using populations.
However, with the exception of Spain, in 2006, Member States assessed the availability and accessibility of cocaine-specific treatment programmes as low.
Unlike opioid dependence, no effective pharmacological treatment options are currently available to help cocaine users maintain abstinence or reduce use (see the 2007 selected issue on cocaine).
Experimental therapeutic drugs to reduce cocaine consumption and cravings have shown potential in clinical trials (e.g. baclofen, tiagabine, topiramate).
Modafinil, a central nervous system stimulant, has shown particularly promising results as a psychostimulant substitution drug with the advantage that, compared to other potential substitute drugs (e.g. d-amphetamine), its abuse liability is low (Myrick et al., 2004).
Of the Member States that report high prevalence levels of cocaine or crack cocaine, several have been particularly active in responding to this problem.
In 2007, Spain introduced a specific national action plan on cocaine, while Ireland implemented and evaluated a number of specific programmes aimed at different groups of cocaine users.
These programmes target problematic intranasal cocaine users, polydrug users with cocaine problems, as well as women and sex workers using cocaine.
In Italy, a largescale clinical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmaceuticals (aripiprazole and ropinirole) for the treatment of cocaine dependence.
By rewarding abstinence, contingency management (CM) aims to reduce the reinforcing effects of drugs.
Typically, CM is introduced at the beginning of a course of treatment, with psychosocial support, and the incentives are contingent on the production of drugfree urine samples.
For example, the incentive could be vouchers of small monetary value, which increase with each successive period of abstinence. In this scenario, failure to stay drugfree results in the loss of the accumulated gains.
This technique repeatedly reinforces the drugfree behaviour of the client and provides a regular goal to be achieved.
The strongest evidence for the effectiveness of CM in maintaining abstinence from drugs comes from studies on cocaine and heroin treatment, though there is some evidence for the approach in cannabis and methamphetamine treatment.
Information on the nature of the services provided to problem cocaine users in Europe is scarce.
Nonetheless, national clinical publications or surveys among professionals provide a good insight in to current practices.
According to a recent UnitedKingdom report (NICE, 2007), cocaine-related problems in British specialised treatment centres appear to be only addressed when the primary drug problem is related to opioids.
Also, a recent Italian survey among experts involved in the treatment of cocaine users indicated difficulties in applying some of the elements considered by them as crucial factors for achieving successful treatment outcomes, such as providing appropriate services (e.g. short-term residential care, structured psychosocial interventions), or clinically differentiating the different types of cocaine users.
These difficulties were reported to be due to organisational problems, lack of resources and lack of effective cocaine-specific treatment interventions.
It is likely that professionals in other Member States face similar problems.
Adequate investment, appropriate treatment protocols and specialised training needs are, therefore, likely to be key issues for service development in this area.
Although most research on CM has been conducted outside Europe, feasibility studies of CM have recently reported positive results in Spain for cocaine users (Secades-Villa et al., 2008) and in addressing cocaine use among opioid substitution treatment clients in the Netherlands (DeFuentesMerillas and De Jong, 2008), where the average incentive at the end of the trial was goods to the value of EUR 150.
An economic analysis by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2007) in the UnitedKingdom suggested that CM is a cost-effective option in the context of cocaine treatment, especially when considering the wider economic costs of cocaine use.
See ‘Contingency management’.
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe be referred to residential rehabilitation programmes and therapeutic communities.
These programmes not only aim to achieve abstinence, but offer respite and intensive care and support in order to help the users to change their chaotic and high-risk lifestyles.
Immunotherapy for cocaine dependence through a cocaine vaccine (TA-CD) is also under investigation.
Once administered, the vaccine induces the production of antibodies that bind to cocaine molecules in the bloodstream and, thereby, allow naturally occurring enzymes to convert them in to inactive molecules.
The results of the initial clinical trials are encouraging, though further studies are required to test the viability of the vaccine as a pharmacotherapy for cocaine dependence.
A qualitative study in six Spanish cities showed that the main substances used among sex workers were alcohol and cocaine.
Drug use was reported as occasional and instrumental in helping to reduce psychological barriers or inhibition, and increase tolerance to long hours of sex work with different clients.
Among the consequences of drug use in prostitutes were unprotected sex and a higher risk of violence by clients.
Severe crack cocaine consumption patterns are also often observed in this group.
The cocaine vaccine is primarily intended to be used in relapse prevention, but the term ‘vaccine’ also raises expectations about its potential use to prevent cocaine dependence when used as a prophylactic treatment (e.g. in drug-naive children or adolescents).
The effectiveness of such an approach is uncertain and raises ethical concerns, which are discussed in depth in the forthcoming EMCDDA publication Addiction neurobiology: ethical and social implications.
Sex workers with cocaine and crack cocaine problems are targeted by outreach and harmreduction services.
For example, in the Netherlands, municipal health services have implemented special health programmes targeting crack cocaine-using sex workers; in France, the association Espoir Goutte d’Or, which focuses on risk prevention and harmreduction for crack cocaine users and sex workers, organises voluntary counselling on a weekly basis and rapid testing for HIV and hepatitis.
Problem cocaine use is frequently associated with severe physical and mental health consequences.
For example, an Irish twoyear follow-up survey on cocaine in local communities revealed a deterioration of the general health of cocaine-dependent clients, especially among injectors.
Several projects also reported arise in the number of clients experiencing abscesses and wounds due to poor injecting habits; other problems reported among clients using cocaine include weight loss, sexually transmitted infections, heart conditions, amputations and risk taking.
Member States usually provide cocaine-injecting users with the same services and facilities as those provided to opioid users, such as recommendations for safe use, training for safe injecting and needle exchange programmes. Lowthreshold drug services play a significant role in this respect as they provide basic care, as well as counselling and medical help.
Users with severe cocaine and crackrelated problems, such as co-morbid physical and mental health problems or social problems, such as housing, can
Recreational use of cocaine in combination with excessive alcohol consumption frequently occurs in nightlife settings and can be associated with serious acute physical problems.
As reported in Chapter 4, Member States are increasingly adopting an integrated approach towards reducing harm related to the use of alcohol and illicit drugs in recreational settings.
The programmes offer advice and information to young people on the risks associated with alcohol and drug use in general, usually including material on the risks associated with acute and chronic cocaine consumption.
Chapter 6 Opioid use and drug injection
Heroin supply and availability via south Asia (Bangladesh) (INCB, 2008a).
Within the European Union, the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Belgium play an important role as secondary distribution hubs (Europol, 2008).
Two forms of imported heroin have historically been offered on the illicit drugs market in Europe: the commonly available brown heroin (its chemical base form), which comes mainly from Afghanistan; and white heroin (a salt form), which typically originates from south-east Asia, though this form is considerably less common (104).
In addition, some opioid drugs are produced within Europe, principally homemade poppy products (e.g. poppy straw, poppy concentrate from crushed poppy stalks or heads) in some east European countries (e.g. Latvia, Lithuania).
Worldwide reported seizures of opioids increased in 2006 to 384 tonnes for opium and to 104 tonnes for heroin and morphine.
While Iran accounted for most of the opium (81%) seized worldwide, heroin and morphine were intercepted mainly in Pakistan (34%), followed by Iran (20%), Turkey (10%) and China (6%) (UNODC, 2008).
In Europe, an estimated 48 200 seizures resulted in the interception of 19.4 tonnes of heroin in 2006.
The UnitedKingdom continued to report the highest number of seizures, while Turkey again reported the greatest amount seized, with 10.3 tonnes recovered in 2006 (105).
The amount of heroin intercepted in an average seizure varied greatly between these two countries, with the size of the average seizure in Turkey being 100 times that reported for the United Kingdom, reflecting different positions in the supply chain (Figure 6).
Over the last 10 years, heroin seizures have been fluctuating downwards in Europe, with a relative peak in 2001 and a record low in 2003.
The quantity of heroin intercepted in the European Union has shown an overall decline between 2001 and 2006. In contrast, the amount seized in Turkey has increased almost three-fold during this period.
Heroin consumed in Europe originates predominantly in Afghanistan, which remains the world leader in illicit opium supply, followed by Myanmar and Mexico.
Global opium production increased again substantially (34%) in 2007 to an estimated 88 70 tonnes, mainly as a result of an increase in Afghan production, which was estimated at 8 200 tonnes.
Global potential production of heroin has consequently reached a record level in 2007, with an estimated 733 tonnes (UNODC, 2008).
The rising number of laboratories dismantled in Afghanistan over the last few years suggests that opium is increasingly being transformed in to morphine or heroin in the country itself.
However, large seizures of morphine in neighbouring countries (Pakistan, Iran) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan (CND, 2008; UNODC, 2007a).
Global seizures of acetic anhydride (used in the illicit manufacture of heroin) increased to 26 400 litres in 2006, most of it recovered in the Russian Federation (99 00 litres) and Colombia (8 800 litres), followed by Turkey (3 800 litres) (INCB, 2008b).
Heroin enters Europe mainly by two major trafficking routes: the historically important Balkan route and its several branches, following transit through Pakistan, Iran and Turkey; and the increasingly used ‘northern route’ via central Asia and the Russian Federation (Figure 6).
Secondary trafficking routes were reported for heroin from south-west Asia, for example directly from Pakistan to Europe (United Kingdom), but also via Pakistan and countries in the Middle East and Africa to illicit markets in Europe and North America (INCB, 2008a; Europol, 2008; UNODC, 2007a; WCO, 2007). Heroin from south-west Asia is also smuggled to Europe

Trafficking flows represented on the map synthesise the analyses of a variety of international and national organisations (Reitox national focal points, Europol, INCB, UNODC, WCO).
Such analyses are based on information related to drug seizures along the trafficking routes, and also intelligence information from law enforcement agencies in transit and destination countries, and sometimes on reports from complementary sources.
The main trafficking routes represented on the map should be considered as indicative of the main flows, as there may be deviations to other countries along the routes, and there are numerous secondary sub-regional routes not represented here which may change rapidly.
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Figure 7: Estimates of the annual prevalence of problem opioid use ( casesper1000 population aged 15–64) illegally produced fentanyl in Estonia, points to the need to monitor more closely the availability of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl (which is considerably more potent than heroin).
Cases
The retail price of brown heroin varied in 2006 from EUR 14.5 per gram in Turkey to EUR 110 per gram in Sweden, with most European countries reporting typical prices of EUR 30–45 per gram.
The price of white heroin is reported only by a few European countries and ranged between EUR 27 and EUR 110 per gram.
The symbol indicates a point estimate; a bar indicates an estimation uncertainty interval: a 95% confidence interval, or one based on sensitivity analysis.
Target groups may vary slightly, owing to different estimation methods and data sources; therefore, comparisons should be made with caution.
Non-standard age ranges were used in the studies from Finland (15–54) and Malta (12–64).
For Germany, the interval represents the lowest bound of all existing estimates and the highest bound of them, and the point estimate a simple average of the midpoints.

Data in this section are derived from the EMCDDA problem drug use (PDU) indicator, which includes mainly injecting drug use and the use of opioids, although in a few countries users of amphetamines or cocaine are also an important component.
Estimates of the number of problem opioid users are generally uncertain, given the relatively low prevalence and hidden nature of this type of drug use, and statistical extrapolations are required to obtain prevalence estimates from the available data sources.
Moreover, as most studies are based on a localised geographical area, such as a city or district, extrapolation to the national level is often difficult.
For example, in some countries where problem opioid use has historically predominated, recent reports suggest that other drugs including cocaine are growing in importance.
Estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use at national level during the period 2002–06 range roughly between one and six casesper1000 population aged 15–64;
From the relatively limited data available, an estimated average prevalence of problem opioid use of between four and five casesper1000 of the population aged 15–64 can be derived.
Assuming this reflects the EU as a whole, it implies some 1.5 million (1.3 million to 1.7 million) problem opioid users in the EU and Norway in 2006.
Trends and incidence of problem opioid use
Opioid indicators are no longer decreasing
In contrast to trends described in previous annual reports, recent data show some increases in druginduced deaths, heroin seizures and new treatment demands for heroin in the European Union.
Time trends in the prevalence of problem opioid use are difficult to estimate because of the limited number of repeated estimates and the uncertainty around individual estimates.
Data from nine countries with repeated estimates during the period 2001–06 suggest diverse developments.
Prevalence seems relatively stable in the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, Slovakia and Finland, whereas an increase was observed in Austria (most recent data 2004) and signs of a possible decrease in Cyprus (108).
In 2003, the downward trend in the number of druginduced deaths reported in Europe, mostly related to the use of opioids, ceased and between 2003 and 2005 most Member States have been reporting an upward trend.
Numbers of seizures of heroin increased by over 10% in 16 out of 24 reporting countries between 2003 and 2006.
After falling for several years, new demands for treatment with heroin as the primary drug have increased in about half of the countries reporting data between 2005 and 2006.
This may reflect a change in incidence of heroin use beginning a few years earlier, because of the natural time lag between initiation of use and first treatment.
These recent trends occur alongside increased opium production in Afghanistan, raising a concern that these events might be linked through increased availability of heroin on the European market.
This is an important issue for further investigation as available data do not allow a clear picture to be drawn.
Moreover, important confounding factors exist.
For example, the use of pharmaceutical opioids for non-medical purposes is reported to have continued at high levels or increased in several countries (Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Austria, Finland) and may represent an important factor in explaining trends in druginduced deaths.
treatment found that primary opioid users accounted overall for 59% of clients but only for 40% of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives (110).
Incidence of problem opioid use (the number of new cases occurring in a given year) is a more sensitive measure for changes over time, and may provide an early view on future developments in prevalence and in treatment demand. The estimation models used, though, make several assumptions.
Furthermore, these models can provide only a partial estimate of incidence, as they are based on only those cases that come in to contact with treatment.
Only two countries report recent data, showing different trends.
In Italy, incidence is estimated to have declined from around 32 500 new cases in 1990 to about 22000 new cases in 1997, after which it has risen again to around 30 000 new cases in 2006.
In Spain, to the contrary, the incidence of problem opioid use is estimated to have continuously declined since its peak around 1980, although in recent years (2002–04) it seems to have stabilised at a relatively low level (around 3 000 new cases per year).
The EMCDDA, in collaboration with a group of national experts, has recently developed new guidelines for incidence estimation, in order to encourage further work in this area (Scalia Tomba et al., 2008).
Most drug clients entering outpatient treatment for primary opioid use also use other drugs, including cocaine (25%), other opioids (23%) and cannabis (18%).
Of the 387 000 treatment requests reported in 2006 (data available from 24 countries), heroin was recorded as the principal drug in 47% of cases for which the primary drug is known.
In most countries, between 50% and 80% of all treatment demands are reported to be related to opioid use; in the remaining countries the proportion varies between 15% and 40% (109).
Opioids are not only the most frequently reported primary drug among those entering treatment but even more so among those who are already in treatment.
A recent project involving nine countries and focusing on all clients in
Buprenorphine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40% of all clients in Finland and 8% of clients in France.
In Latvia and Sweden, between 5% and 8% of drug clients report primary use of opioids other than heroin or methadone: mainly buprenorphine, painkillers and other opioids (112).
Several countries report

The absolute number of heroin treatment demands reported through the treatment demand indicator increased by over 30 000 cases from 108100 to 138 500 between 2002 and 2006.
Similarly, among clients entering treatment for the first time in their life, there was an increase in the number of primary heroin users from around 33 000 in 2002 to over 41000 in 2006. Factors that might explain this trend include an increase in the numbers of problem heroin users, an expansion in treatment provision or improved reporting coverage.
Injecting drug use
Injecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use, such as blood-borne infections (e.g. HIV/AIDS, hepatitis) or druginduced deaths.
Only 11 countries were able to provide recent estimates of the levels of injecting drug use, despite their importance for public health (Figure 8).
Improving the level of information available on this special population is, therefore, an important challenge for the development of health monitoring systems in Europe.
The available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the prevalence of injecting drug use.
For Estonia, the upper limit of the uncertainty interval is off-scale (37.9 per 1 000).
See Figure PDU-2 in the 2008 statistical bulletin for further details.
Reitox national focal points.
Injecting among opioid users entering treatment
Among opioid users entering outpatient treatment for the first time in 2006, a slightly lower proportion report injecting the drug (around 40%).
Looking at time trends, the proportion of injectors among new opioid clients decreased from 43% in 2003 to 35% 2006 in the 13 countries where sufficient data are available (115).
Overall, 43% of all opioid users entering drug outpatient treatment in 2006 reported injecting the drug.
Changes in the proportion of injectors among heroin users entering treatment may indicate trends in the wider group of problem opioid users.
Declines in this proportion between 2002 and 2006 have been observed by nine countries (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Greece, France, Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, Turkey), whereas two countries report an increase (Romania, Slovakia).
An analysis of the treatment demand data for nine countries taking part in a pilot study revealed that around 63% of all opioid clients (those already in treatment

See Tables PDU-104, TDI-4, TDI-5 and TDI-17 (part v) in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
Chapter 6: Opioid use and drug injection and those entering treatment in the last year) reported injecting the drug at entry to treatment (116
that among clients already in treatment the proportion of injectors at treatment entrance was relatively high.
In general, a large proportion of new injectors has to give cause for alarm, especially if reinforced by a large proportion of young injectors.
While a higher proportion of new injectors can indicate a new upsurge of injecting, other factors could also relate to this (e.g. shorter injecting careers, better treatment availability, higher death rates among the older population).
Studies among injecting drug users may provide another window on national differences and changes over time in injecting drug use within Europe.
Many countries conduct regularly repeated studies on groups of injectors, usually in the context of infectious disease testing, that are often recruited from a variety of settings in order to maximise generalisability.
Comparisons between countries should be made with caution due to potential biases in selective recruitment to these studies (117).
Some countries show large proportions (above 20%) of new injecting drug users (injecting for less than two years) in these studies, whereas in several countries this proportion is under 10% (Figure 9).
Young injecting drug users (under age 25) account for more than 40% of the injectors sampled in the Czech Republic, Estonia,
The varying levels of new injectors in these countries, where information is available, may reflect differences in the average age of initiation as well as increasing injecting incidence among the younger or the older populations.

Clients entering treatment for primary opioid use tend to be older (mean age 32 years) than those entering treatment for cocaine, other stimulants and cannabis (mean age 31, 27 and 24 years respectively), with female clients generally being one or two years younger than their male counterparts.
Opioid clients are generally younger in those countries that have joined the European Union since 2004 and in Ireland, Greece, Austria and Finland (118).
On average, men outnumber women opioid clients by three to one, with higher proportions of men found, in particular, in south European countries (Bulgaria, Greece,
A simple comparison of the estimates of the number of problem opioid users and the reported number of treatments delivered suggests that more than one in three could be receiving substitution treatment.
Opioid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment than other clients (see Chapter 2), and in some countries a higher frequency of co-morbid psychiatric disorders is noted.
About half of opioid users seeking treatment report initiation before the age of 20 and around one third between the age of 20 and 24 years; first use of opioids after the age of 25 is uncommon (120
New pharmaceutical options for the treatment of opioid dependency have been developed and made available in Europe. The aims of these new prescribing options include improving the effectiveness of treatment, responding to the needs of different groups of opioid users and reducing the possibilities for the misuse of substitution drugs.

Treatment provision and coverage
A buprenorphine/naloxone combination was launched on the EU market in 2006 as an alternative to buprenorphine alone, with the aim of reducing the potential and attractiveness for injecting use.
A number of Member States are currently assessing the value of this substance as a treatment option for opioid dependence (1).
Treatment for opioid users is mostly conducted in outpatient settings, which can include specialist centres, general practitioners and lowthreshold facilities.
In a few countries, inpatient centres also play a major role, notably Bulgaria, Greece, Finland and Sweden (122
Drugfree and substitution treatments for opioid use are available in all EU Member States, Croatia and Norway.
In Turkey, the future use of substitution treatment is currently under study.
In most countries substitution treatment is the most widely available option, though in 2005, Hungary, Poland and Sweden reported that drugfree approaches were predominant.
Prescription of medical heroin (diamorphine), as a treatment option for chronic treatment-resistant opioid users, is available to a limited extent in the Netherlands (815 clients in 2006), the UnitedKingdom (400 clients) and Germany, where the participants of the heroin trial continue to receive diamorphine according to a special regulation.
Additionally, a randomised trial of injectable opioids (RIOTT) is currently underway in the UnitedKingdom which will assess the effectiveness of injectable diamorphine, injectable methadone and oral methadone.
In February 2008, it was also decided to introduce a diamorphine prescription scheme in Denmark.
Technical information on the substance is available on the EMEA website (http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/ Humans/EPAR/suboxone/suboxone.htm).
Substitution treatment, generally integrated with psychosocial care, is typically provided at specialised outpatient centres and in shared-care arrangements with office-based general practitioners. The available data
See Tables TDI-10, TDI-32 and TDI-103 in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
the black market.
The UnitedKingdom guidelines on clinical management of drug dependence have also been updated, and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence has issued specific guidance on methadone and buprenorphine prescribing, treatment with naltrexone, detoxification and on psychosocial treatment.
While oral methadone remains the main drug used for substitution treatment in Europe, the use of buprenorphine is becoming increasingly common.
One reason for this is that it may be associated with lower rates of mortality when misused (Connock et al., 2007).
The Danish National Board of Health, after a review of substitution guidelines, has now urged general practitioners to prescribe buprenorphine instead of methadone.
Treatment effectiveness, quality and standards
There is wide recognition among EU policymakers for the need to harmonise practice and quality of services between community and prisons.
However, a report issued by the European Commission (2007a) highlighted the lack of services for drug users available in prisons and drew attention to the importance of intervening in this setting.
Examples of the limitations in the provision of drugs services in prison include: lack of capacity and expertise (Latvia, Poland, Malta), fragmented assistance (Latvia), lack of interventions for specific groups such as young drug-using inmates (Austria), and absence of a public-health based prevention strategy (Greece).
Reviews of randomised controlled trials and observational studies conclude that methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) can both be effective for the management of opioid dependence.
A recent Cochrane review concluded, however, that buprenorphine is less effective than methadone delivered at adequate doses (Mattick et al., 2008).
A number of studies have also found that diamorphine maintenance can be effective for people failing to respond to MMT (Schulte et al., in press).
Overall, substitution treatment has been linked to a number of positive outcomes including: retention in treatment, reductions in illicit opioid use and injecting, reductions of mortality and criminal behaviour, and stabilisation and improvement of health and social conditions of chronic heroin users.
More positively, prison drug programmes have become more widespread, and new initiatives are reported by many countries.
Psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions combined with pharmocotherapy have also shown to be effective in treatment outcome studies, for example NTORS in the UnitedKingdom (Gossop et al., 2002) and DATOS in the United States (Hubbard et al., 2003).
These approaches may not only increase treatment motivation, prevent relapse and reduce harm, but also provide advice and practical support to clients who have to address their housing, employment and family-related problems in parallel to treating their opioid dependence.
The available evidence, however, does not support the use of psychosocial treatments alone (Mayet et al., 2004).
The level of drug treatment provision in prison remains low, compared to the community, although the prevalence of drug use is generally higher.
In many countries, detoxification is the preferred and sometimes the only treatment option available.
Substitution treatment is offered in theory in most countries, but data indicate that few drug users receive it in practice.
Exceptions are Spain, where 14% of all sentenced prisoners (19 600) received substitution treatment in 2006, and the UnitedKingdom (England and Wales), where it is expected that the numbers receiving methadone will increase from 6 000 to 12000 following the introduction of new guidance in April 2007.
A numberofcountries have recently reported making improvements to their treatment guidelines.
In Croatia, Denmark and Scotland, substitution programmes have been reviewed and guidelines have been revised to increase treatment quality and prevent diversion in to

A recent review of research studies on prison-based substitution programmes concluded that positive effects depended on the provision of sufficient dosage and treatment lasting for the duration of imprisonment (Stallwitz and Stöver, 2007).
Furthermore, careful discharge planning and linkage to community care are other key elements of services in this area needed to ensure that gains in health status made during time spent in custody are not subsequently lost (124).

Chapter 7 Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
Drugrelated infectious diseases
Infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis B and Care among the most serious health consequences of drug use.
Even in countries where HIV prevalence in injecting drug users (IDUs) is low, other infectious diseases including hepatitis A, B and C, sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, tetanus, botulism and human T-lymphotropic virus may disproportionately affect drug users.
The EMCDDA is systematically monitoring HIV and hepatitis B and C among injecting drug users (prevalence of antibodies, or other specific markers in the case of hepatitis B).
The data have to be interpreted with caution, given several methodological limitations in the different data systems (125).
newly diagnosed infections among IDUs in the 25 EU Member States for which national data are available was 5.0 cases per million population, down from 5.6 in 2005 (127).
Of the three countries reporting the highest rates of newly diagnosed infections (Estonia, Latvia, Portugal), Portugal continued to report a downward trend in 2005/06, while in Estonia and Latvia the trends levelled off at 142.0 and 47.1 newly diagnosed cases per million population, respectively.
Between 2001 and 2006, no strong increases have been observed in any country in the population rate of HIV infection.
Where some slight increase is observed (e.g. Bulgaria, Ireland), this remained below one additional case per million population per year.
By the end of 2006, the incidence of diagnosed HIV infection among injecting drug users (IDUs) appears to have been low in most countries of the European Union, and the overall EU situation appears relatively positive in a global context.
This may, at least partly, follow from the increased availability of prevention, treatment and harmreduction measures, including substitution treatment and needle and syringe programmes.
Other factors, such as the decline in injecting drug use that has been reported in some countries, may also have played an important role.
Nonetheless, in some parts of Europe, data suggest that HIV transmission related to injecting drug use still continued at relatively high rates in 2006, underlining the need to ensure the coverage and effectiveness of local prevention practice.
The largest numbers of newly diagnosed infections among IDUs were reported in 2006 by countries with the highest infection rates (Portugal, 703 new diagnoses; Estonia, 191; Latvia, 108) (128) and those with large populations (United Kingdom, 187; Germany, 168; France, 167; Poland, 112) (Figure 10).
Against the general background of declining trends, the largest increases in absolute numbers since 2001 are observed in the United Kingdom, with about 13 additional cases per year, and in Germany, with about 10 additional cases, although these are not evenly distributed over the years.
In Bulgaria, the low rate of increase has accelerated recently, with 0, 2, 0, 7, 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006, suggesting the potential for an outbreak.
Trends in HIV infection
Trend data from HIV prevalence monitoring in samples of IDUs are an important complement to data from HIV-case reporting, as they provide information also on non-diagnosed infection.
Data on newly diagnosed cases related to injecting drug use for 2006 suggest that infection rates are still falling overall in the European Union, following the peak in 2001–02, which was due to outbreaks in Estonia, countries, HIV prevalence remained unchanged during the period.
In five countries (Bulgaria, Germany, Spain,
For details on methods and definitions, see the 2008 statistical bulletin.
See Table INF-104 in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
National data are not available from Spain and Italy.
Adjusting for those two countries, the rate would be 5.9 cases per million population, down from 6.4 in 2005.
In Portugal, 703 cases were reported by EuroHIV for 2006, while 432 were reported by the Portuguese Epidemiological Surveillance Centre of Transmissible Disease (CVEDT); the discrepancy is due to classification by reporting year (EuroHIV) versus by year of diagnosis (CVEDT).

No national data are available for Spain and Italy, data are shown for regions where available.

Italy, Latvia) prevalence showed statistically significant decreases, all based on national samples.
Although in two of these, regional increases were also reported: in Bulgaria, one city, Sofia; and in Italy, eight out of 21 regions and one city.
Finally, in five countries, national trends are either not reported or appear stable, while there was at least one sub-national sample indicating an increasing trend, even if prevalence levels remain mostly at low levels (Belgium, Czech Republic, Lithuania, United Kingdom, and possibly Slovenia).
The high annual rate of new HIV diagnoses related to injecting drug use in Estonia, Latvia and Portugal suggests that transmission is still occurring in these countries at high levels.
For Estonia, this is supported by 2005 prevalence data, which suggest that around a third of new IDUs (those injecting for less than two years) were HIV positive.
Further indications of ongoing HIV transmission are given by reports of high prevalence levels (over 5%) among young IDUs (samples of 50 or more IDUs under age 25) in several countries: Spain (national data, 2005), Portugal (national data, 2006), Estonia (two regions, 2005), Latvia (national and in two cities, 2002/03), Lithuania (one city, 2006) and Poland (one city, 2005) (130).
Information on the incidence of AIDS is important for showing the new occurrence of symptomatic disease, though it is not a good indicator of HIV transmission.
AIDS incidence data may also provide information on the coverage and effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). High incidence rates of AIDS in some
The comparison of trends in newly diagnosed infections related to injecting drug use with trends in HIV prevalence among IDUs suggests that the incidence of HIV infection related to injecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level.
See Tables INF-109 and INF-110 in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
The most recent data indicate that the incidence of HIV infection among IDUs is generally low in the European Union.
However, vigilance is needed as some Member States continue to show high rates of new HIV infections linked to injecting drug use, and the situation is even more worrying in some neighbouring countries.
While high prevalence levels of HIV infection are found only in some EU Member States, viral hepatitis and, in particular, infection caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV), is more highly prevalent in IDUs across Europe.
HCV antibody levels among national samples of IDUs in 2005–06 vary from around 15% to 90%, with most countries typically reporting levels in excess of 40%.
Only a few countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland) report a prevalence of under 25% in national samples of IDUs; though infection rates at this level still constitute a significant public health problem (132).
After a recent HIV epidemic in Estonia and Latvia, rates of newly diagnosed infections in IDUs decreased from 2001 but have now stabilised at still high levels (142.0 and 47.1 new cases per million population, respectively, in 2006), suggesting that transmission rates remain high.
Portugal still has the largest number of newly diagnosed infections in the European Union (see p.
78) and, although the trend is down, the annual rate of newly reported diagnoses is still high at 66.5 new cases per million population in 2006.
In neighbouring countries to the east of the European Union, the situation is of particular concern.
In the two largest countries, Russia and Ukraine, the number of newly diagnosed cases is high and still increasing.
In 2006, newly diagnosed infections related to injecting drug use were estimated at over 11 000 in Russia and 7 000 in Ukraine (78.6 and 152.9 new cases per million, respectively).
Within countries, HCV prevalence levels can vary considerably, reflecting both regional differences and the characteristics of the sampled population.
For example, in the United Kingdom, local studies report levels between 29% and 59%, while in Italy different regional estimates range from around 40% to 96%.
While estimates generated from non-probability samples must always be taken with caution, the variations in prevalence levels found are likely to have important implications for the targeting and delivery of prevention and treatment programmes.
Furthermore, understanding the factors responsible for differential levels of infection is likely to inform the development of better intervention strategies.
High rates of ongoing transmission among IDUs indicate the need to review both the availability, level and range of existing service provision, including specific measures aimed at reducing the spread of infectious diseases, such as needle exchange and substitution treatment.
In addition, targeted studies among IDUs are needed to investigate why some populations appear particularly vulnerable, the factors associated with risk behaviour and barriers for self-protection, and to identify promising approaches to prevent new outbreaks.
Studies among young (under age 25) and new (injecting for less than two years) IDUs suggest that the time window to prevent HCV infection is quite short, as many contract the virus early in their injecting careers.
Recent studies (2005–06) typically report prevalence levels of between 20% and 50%, although with considerable variation between samples.
European countries may indicate that many IDUs infected with HIV do not receive HAART at a sufficiently early stage in their infection to obtain maximum benefit from the treatment.
The prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B virus (HBV) varies to an even greater extent than that of HCV antibodies, possibly partly due to differences in vaccination levels, although other factors may play a role. The most complete data set available is that for the antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), which indicates a history of infection.
In 2005–06, six of the 11 countries providing data on IDUs reported anti-HBc prevalence levels of over 40% (133).
The proportion of IDUs among all notified cases of hepatitis B may have declined slightly in some countries, possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vaccination programmes targeted at IDUs.
In the case of hepatitis C, the proportion of IDUs among notified cases has declined in five countries, but has increased in
Access to HIV testing and treatment provision in Europe have increased considerably over the past decade.
Among people with HIV infection in Europe, as many as one in every three may be unaware of being infected (ECDC, 2007), and reports from some EU Member States suggest that levels of awareness may even be lower among infected IDUs.
As a result many of those who become infected with the virus will not have the advantage of early treatment and care.
They may also contribute to the spread of HIV by unknowingly exposing others to the risk of infection.
In addition, the quality of the data collected by the HIV surveillance systems is diminished.
Assessing the coverage of needle and syringe programmes is difficult, and only some countries provide relevant figures.
For instance, the CzechRepublic reports a network of 90 lowthreshold facilities, which reaches about 25 000 drug users per year, 70% of whom are injectors, and provides on average 210 syringes per IDU.
Preliminary data suggest that access to antiretroviral treatment and care by IDUs is disproportionately low (Donoghoe et al., 2007).
Effective antiviral treatment approaches need to take account of the specific situation and needs of IDUs.
These can include coexisting health and social problems (e.g. homelessness and lack of insurance), but also stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings or repeated arrests and incarceration.
To improve the access to HIV testing and treatment, the EMCDDA has developed specific guidelines for offering annual voluntary medical examination to IDUs, including
1 testing for HIV and viral hepatitis (

Increases in the numbers of syringes given out by needle and syringe programmes are reported from some countries: in Estonia, the estimated number of syringes given out per IDU has doubled between 2005 and 2006, reaching 112; in the same period, Hungary’s syringe exchange programmes increased their turnover of syringes by 56% and their clients by 84%; and Finland continues to report arise in the number of clients seen and syringes distributed at health counselling centres.
Not all countries reported increases, however: in Malta and Slovakia, syringe provision remained stable in 2006; Poland reported a decrease in the number of agencies operating and a reduction of 15% in the number of syringes exchanged; Romania reported a 70% decline in the number of syringes exchanged in Bucharest, with financial problems being reported as the main cause.
five other countries (Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Malta, Sweden, UnitedKingdom ) (134).
For both hepatitis B and hepatitis C, the proportion of IDUs among the notified cases continued to differ markedly between countries in 2006, suggesting geographic differences in the epidemiology of these infections, although bias due to different testing and reporting practices cannot be ruled out.
In a number of countries, stabilisation or decreases in syringe exchange may reflect changes in overall patterns of drug injecting and in the availability of treatment: in Luxembourg, the number of syringes distributed by lowthreshold agencies, after increasing for several years, stabilised in 2005 and decreased in 2006; recent declines in syringe provision have also been reported in Portugal and Belgium (the Flemish community), and at the local level in Germany and the Netherlands.
EU Member States employ a combination of some of the following measures to reduce the spread and consequences of infectious diseases among drug users: drug treatment, including substitution treatment (see Chapter 6), health information and counselling, distribution of sterile injection materials, and education towards safer sex and safer use. The availability and coverage of these measures varies significantly between countries.
Levels of both substitution treatment and harmreduction service
The delivery of infectious disease prevention services through outreach teams or at lowthreshold facilities is also established in
See Tables INF-105 and INF-106 in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
In Denmark, free hepatitis A and B vaccinations have been available since 2006 for drug users and their partners, and municipalities must now provide a comprehensive range of services for infectious diseases to those who inject drugs. Finally, in Ireland, a working group on HCV was tasked in 2007 with the development of a national strategy for surveillance, education and treatment.
Transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues among IDUs in Europe, among whom rates of active HBV infection (prevalence of HBsAg) remain high in most countries, compared to the general population (1).
Vaccination is considered the most effective measure to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its consequences.
In line with the 1991 WHO recommendation, most, but not all EU Member States have adopted universal vaccination against this virus.
Infant vaccination policies, however, will mostly affect future generations of drug users.
To reduce the spread of the infection sooner, over half the EU Member States have adopted vaccination programmes specifically targeting injecting drug users and/or prisoners.
Nevertheless, coverage of these programmes varies between countries, and a third of EU Member States still report no vaccination programme specifically for drug users.
Prisons are important settings for interventions targeting infectious diseases related to drug use and for providing healthcare to a population that is otherwise hard to reach (see Chapter 2).
Recent research indicates that it is important to provide viral testing to all those who have ever engaged in illicit drug use and showed that the detection of chronic hepatitis C infection on reception in to prison was a cost-effective measure (Sutton et al., 2006).
In addition to those with infections receiving the necessary treatment and care, drug users in prison could benefit from a range of interventions such as health education and hepatitis B immunisation (135).
Vaccination programmes targeting drug users often face the problem of low compliance resulting in non-completion of vaccination courses.
Given the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, strategies to achieve higher levels of immunisation among those at risk may involve a flexible approach, targeting drug users early in their career and reaching out to those communities with a higher prevalence of drug use.
Repeated offers of vaccination and extra doses for those with decreased immune response may also help to achieve higher immunisation results.
This may require EU Member States to review and possibly fine-tune their policies in order to decrease the occurrence of chronic HBV infection and its consequences.

Drugrelated deaths and mortality a majority of countries, although services in this area are still being developed.
Drug use is one of the major causes of health problems and death among young people in Europe.
The considerable mortality resulting from opioid use, in particular, is illustrated by an international study supported by the EMCDDA, which found that in seven European urban areas, 10% to 23% of mortality among 15- to 49-year-olds could be attributed to opioid use (Bargagli et al., 2005).
The EMCDDA’s key indicator ‘Drugrelated deaths and mortality among drug users’ principally monitors deaths directly caused by drug use (drug-induced deaths) and, to a more limited extent, overall mortality among drug users, which also includes deaths associated with various other health and social problems.
Druginduced deaths
The EMCDDA definition of druginduced deaths (136) refers to those deaths that are directly caused (poisonings or overdoses) by the consumption of one or more drugs, where at least one of the substances present is an illicit
Medical services are provided at lowthreshold clinics and by mobile services, or via referral schemes.
For example, the Czech lowthreshold network works closely with regional public healthcare services to facilitate access to counselling, testing and treatment for somatic co-morbidity, in particular, viral hepatitis.
In Bulgaria, a mobile surgery in Bourgas, on the Black Sea, provided 750 consultations in 2006.
Some Danish municipalities received government funds for healthcare programmes targeted at the most vulnerable drug users.
In addition, the ‘health room’ project in Copenhagen, which combines healthcare and social counselling measures with a lowthreshold approach, is a three-year pilot scheme established in 2008.
See the DUP tables in the 2008 statistical bulletin.
Chapter 7: Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
Drugrelated mortality: a complex concept of reporting between countries mean that any direct comparisons should be made with caution.
During the period 1990–2005, between 6 500 and 8 500 druginduced deaths were reported each year by EU Member States, adding up to about 130 000 deaths.
These figures should be considered as a minimum estimate (138).
Another important issue is the substances considered, which can be limited to illicit drugs or extended to other psychoactive substances and medicines.
Moreover, many druginduced deaths are, in fact, polydrug deaths, and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult.
Population mortality due to druginduced death varies widely between countries, ranging from three to five to over 70 deaths per million inhabitants aged 15–64 years (on average, 21 deaths per million).
Rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 16 European countries and over 40 per million in five countries.
Among males aged 15–39 years, the mortality rates are, on average and in most countries, twice as high (averaging 44 deaths per million in Europe).
In 2005–06, druginduced deaths accounted for 3.5% of all deaths among Europeans aged 15–39 years, and for more than 7% in eight countries (139) (Figure 11).
Conceptually, drugrelated mortality includes two broad components. The first, and best documented, refers to those deaths directly caused by the action of one or more drugs.
These deaths are typically called ‘overdoses’, ‘poisonings’ or ‘drug-induced deaths’.
The second component is broader and covers deaths which cannot be directly attributable to the pharmacological action of the drugs, but are nevertheless linked with their use: long-term consequences of infectious diseases, interactions with mental health issues (e.g. suicide) or with other circumstances (e.g. road traffic accidents).
There are also deaths related to drugs, but due to circumstantial reasons (e.g. violence related to the drug trade).
There is still limited research on the morbidity and other consequences of non-fatal overdoses and limited investment in prevention efforts, despite evidence that the numbers may be considerable.
Studies have estimated that there could be between 20 and 25 non-fatal overdoses for each fatal one.
Although it is difficult to know if these estimations can be applied to the European Union as a whole, it would produce a rough estimation of about 120 000 to 175 000 non-fatal overdoses per year.
Deaths related to opioids
The EMCDDA’s current approach to reporting on overall drugrelated mortality is based on estimating mortality rates among cohorts of problem drug users.
However, other approaches are being explored whereby data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attributable to drugs in a community (see ‘Overall drugrelated mortality’, p. 86).
Opioid overdose is one of the leading causes of death among young people in Europe, particularly among males in urban areas (140
The number of drug users, their patterns of use (injection, polydrug use) and the availability of treatment and emergency services are all factors that can influence the overall number of such deaths in a community.
In general, druginduced deaths occur shortly after the consumption of the substance(s).
metabolites, a represent in the majority of druginduced deaths reported in the European Union, accounting for 55% to almost 100% of all cases, with over half of the countries reporting proportions of over 80% (141).
In the toxicology reports on deaths attributed to heroin, other substances are often found that may have played a role. The most frequently reported of these are alcohol, benzodiazepines, other opioids and, in some countries, cocaine.
Improvements in the quality and reliability of European data in recent years have allowed better descriptions of overall and national trends, and most countries have now adopted a case definition in line with that of the

The calculations of population mortality rates are based on national populations for 2005 as reported by Eurostat.

problems occurring during treatment (144
The majority of opioid overdose deaths (60–95%) are male, mostly between 20 and 40 years of age, with a mean age in most countries in the mid-thirties (142
However, elsewhere (Bulgaria, Estonia, Romania, Austria) a relatively high proportion of overdose deaths are among those under 25 years, which may indicate a younger population using heroin or injecting drugs in these countries (143).
Research shows that substitution treatment reduces the risk of fatal overdose. Each year, however, a number of deaths
The presence of methadone in a substantial proportion of druginduced deaths is reported by several countries, although, in the absence of common reporting standards, the role played by the substance is often unclear.
Most of these deaths are attributable to the misuse of methadone diverted from hospitals, pharmacies, practitioners and pain management physicians, while only a limited number of them are attributed to methadone obtained from substitution programmes (146).
Research has demonstrated that the risk of overdose decreases substantially while heroin users are in methadone substitution treatment.
For example, a recent cohort study, involving more than 5 000 heroin users, reported that the risk of overdose death was reduced by a factor of 9 while users were in substitution treatment compared with time outside, including any other type of treatment or no treatment (Brugal et al., 2005).
Methadone, however, is identified in the toxicological reports of some deaths.
This does not imply the existence, in all cases, of a direct causal link, as other drugs or factors may be present.
Nonetheless, overdose death can occur, and among the factors that may be involved are: changes in tolerance, excessive dosage, inappropriate use by the client, and the drug being used for nontherapeutic purposes.
A worrying epidemic of fatal 3-methylfentanyl poisonings in Estonia has been recently reported based on post-mortem forensic toxicology findings, with 46 fatal poisonings in 2005 and 71 in 2006 (Ojanperä et al., in press).
There have also been sporadic reports of fentanyl deaths from other European countries and recent, generally shortlived, epidemics of deaths have been reported in the United States; for example, 350 deaths were attributed to fentanyl in Chicago between 2005 and 2007 (Denton et al., 2008).
The very high potency of this substance may elevate the risk of drug overdose, while it may be overlooked in toxicological screening.
Increased illicit production and use of fentanyl is therefore likely to challenge both existing monitoring systems and public health responses.
Measures to prevent diversion of methadone in to the illicit market have been linked to reductions in the number of reported methadonedeaths in the UnitedKingdom (Zador et al., 2006) and, overall, good practice in substitution treatment may be an important component in reducing the risk of methadonerelated deaths.
Both patient and community health is, therefore, likely to be safeguarded by improving: quality standards of treatment, including prescription practices; client monitoring during the first phases of treatment; monitoring for possible cardiac toxicities; information on risks of use of other medicines or psychoactive substances; and dispensing practices to decrease the risk of diversion.
Cocaine-induced deaths are more difficult to define and identify than those related to opioids (see the 2007 selected issue on cocaine).
Deaths directly caused by pharmacological overdose seem to be uncommon, and these are usually linked with very large cocaine doses.
Otherwise, most cocaine deaths seem to be the result of the chronic toxicity of the drug leading to cardiovascular and neurological complications.
The role of cocaine in these deaths may not always be identified, and they may not be reported as cocaine-related.
The dramatic expansion of methadone treatment in Europe has not been reflected in a parallel rise of methadonerelated deaths.
A study carried out in the UnitedKingdom found that, between 1993 and 2004, the total quantity of oral methadone prescribed increased by a factor of 3.6, while the number of deaths involving methadone decreased from 226 to 194 (Morgan et al., 2006).
This represents a decrease in the methadonerelated death rate from 13 per 1 000 patient years in 1993 to 3.1 per 1 000 patient years in 2004.
While similar studies in other countries would be very useful, the available evidence suggests that methadonerelated deaths are more likely to be linked to deficiencies in prescribing practices than to overall levels of substitution treatment.
Deaths in which ecstasy is present continue to be infrequently reported.
Most deaths with ‘presence of ecstasy’ are reported in the United Kingdom, but in many cases the drug has not been identified as the direct cause of death.
While amphetamine deaths are also infrequently reported in Europe, in the CzechRepublic a substantial number of druginduced deaths have been attributed to pervitin (methamphetamine).
In Finland, 64 deaths were reported in which amphetamines were identified toxicologically, although this does not necessarily imply that the drug was the direct cause of death.
Trends in druginduced deaths
Europe had a very high mortality rate compared to peers of the same age (see EMCDDA, 2006).
Trends in druginduced deaths over the period 2001 to 2005/06 are more difficult to describe.
In the first years of the decade (2000–03), many EU countries reported decreases and, overall, druginduced deaths fell by 3%
A number of factors could be associated with this, including: increases in polydrug use, a possible growth in the availability of heroin or an ageing population of chronic drug users (152
A recent Norwegian study of a cohort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 189 recorded deaths, overdoses, accounted for half of all deaths, where the causes were known.
Diseases, mainly AIDS and liver diseases, accounted for almost a further quarter, while suicide and trauma each accounted for about one tenth, and alcohol poisonings for about 2% (Figure 12).
It should be noted that the proportion of AIDS deaths can be considerably higher in countries with a high HIV prevalence among drug users.
In the absence of data from some of the larger countries, overall estimates of the number of druginduced deaths for 2006 remain provisional.
However, the available data from 18 countries are suggestive of a small decrease compared to 2005.
The number of druginduced deaths in those younger than 25 years of age has seen a moderate overall decrease in Europe, whereas in those Member States joining the European Union after 2004, until recently there has been an increase in the number of deaths among this age group (153).
This observation requires further investigation, as it could point to increases in the numbers of young people using opioids in these countries.
Cohort studies area valuable tool for estimating and understanding the overall mortality related to drug use, but other approaches can help improve the understanding of the issue and provide an overview at national level.
Several new methods in this area are currently being explored by the EMCDDA, in close collaboration with Member States, with the aim of implementing them at EU level.
In one of these approaches, mortality rates are extrapolated from cohort studies to local (Bargagli et al., 2005) or national estimates of problem drug users (Cruts et al., 2008).
In another approach, drug-attributable fractions, derived from various studies, are applied to the causes of death that are most frequently related to drug use (e.g. AIDS, accidents, suicides and poisonings) and which are recorded in the general population mortality registers.

Reducing drugrelated deaths
Figure 12: Known causes of death among a cohort of drug users in Norway
The reduction of drugrelated deaths is a goal of most national drug strategies, but few countries have adopted action plans or provided systematic guidance on measures to be taken.
However, in 2007, the United Kingdom’s Department of Health issued new guidelines on clinical management of drug misuse and dependence, setting out specific actions for the prevention of drugrelated deaths.
Disease
The contribution that treatment, including substitution along with psychosocial care and psychotherapy, can make to reduce mortality among drug users was shown in a prospective long-term study in Italy (Davoli et al., 2007).
The study was conducted among a cohort of 10 454 heroin users entering public treatment services from 1998 to 2001, and evaluated retention in treatment and overdose mortality.
The risk of death among the cohort was, on average, increased by a factor of 10 compared to the general population; though, among drug users undergoing treatment, the risk of death was four times that of the general population, and those who had stopped treatment were 20 times more likely to die.
The data are from a study based on a sample of 501 drug users admitted for treatment for drug addiction during the period 1981–91.
A total of 189 deaths were recorded up to 2003, of which the cause of death could not be identified in 14 cases.
Ødegard, E., Amundsen, E.J. and Kielland, K.B. (2007), ‘Fatal overdoses and deaths by other causes in a cohort of Norwegian drug abusers: a competing risk approach’, Drug and Alcohol Dependence 89, pp. 176–82.
and EuroHIV (End-year report for 2005, 2006), it can be estimated that, in 2003, over 2 600 people died of
AIDS mortality peaked in the mid-1990s and has decreased substantially following the introduction and increased coverage of HAART.
And, in many countries, overdose mortality is considerably higher
The number of deaths from other causes (e.g. consequences of other infectious diseases, violence, accidents) is more difficult to assess at present and there is a need to improve data collection and estimation in this area (see preceding section).
The proactive monitoring of the psychosocial wellbeing of drug users, including of those in substitution treatment, may have value as drug overdoses are in many cases triggered by previous health or social events, and rates of intentional overdose might be high (Oliver et al., 2007).
A further challenge, in many countries, is that health and social services are dealing with an ageing population of long-term drug users, who may be more vulnerable
Suicide appears to be a frequent cause of death among drug users.
A literature review (Darke and Ross, 2002) found that the suicide rate among heroin users was 14 times higher than that found in the general population.
The year 2003 was taken as the most recent year for which information from almost all Member States regarding causes of death is available through Eurostat.

Drug injectors, in particular, may suffer from high levels of somatic disease, notably chronic infections of the liver, which further increase their vulnerability.
Elevated risk of druginduced death on completion of prison sentences or treatment attributed to drug overdoses or, more generally, to substance use disorders.
Coroners’ records cited the involvement of opioids in 95% of the druginduced deaths, benzodiazepines in 20%, cocaine in 14% and tricyclic antidepressants in 10% of cases.
The risk of druginduced death in the immediate period after release from prison or on relapse after treatment is substantially elevated, according to studies carried out in Europe and elsewhere.
The VEdeTTE study in Italy (Davoli et al., 2007) observed a death rate from overdose of one per 1 000 among heroin users in treatment and 23 per 1 000 in the first month after treatment, corresponding to a risk of overdose death 27 times higher in the first month out of treatment, after adjustment for possible confounders.
A recent study carried out in the UnitedKingdom (England and Wales) compared the records of almost 49 000 prisoners released during 1998–2000 with all deaths recorded up to November 2003 (Farrell and Marsden, 2008).
Of the 442 deaths that occurred among the sample during this period, the majority (59%) were drug-related.
In the year following release, the druginduced mortality rate was 5.2 per 1 000 men and 5.9 per 1 000 women.
In the period immediately after release, expected rates were exceeded by more than 10 times for women and more than eight times for men.
All female and 95% of male deaths that occurred during the first fortnight outside prison were drug-related, and could be
Despite the observed connection between druginduced deaths and prison release or treatment termination, few countries are systematically investing in educating prisoners or those in treatment on the risk of overdose.
Continuity of care and rehabilitation of drug users that are released from prison are also undeveloped in many countries.
Improvements in these two areas could represent valuable opportunities to prevent drugrelated deaths.
Chapter 8 New drugs and emerging trends
Introduction there was a need to control BZP, but the control measures should be appropriate to the relatively low risk posed by the substance.
In March 2008, the Council adopted a decision defining BZP as a new psychoactive substance which is to be made subject to control measures and criminal provisions.
Member States have one year to take the necessary measures, in accordance with their national law, to submit BZP to control measures, proportionate to the risks of the substance, and criminal penalties, as provided for under their legislation complying with their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
In March 2007, the EMCDDA and Europol reported to the Commission on the active monitoring of 1-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazine (mCPP) (159).
This report was produced for information purposes only and concluded that ‘mCPP was unlikely to become established as a recreational drug in its own right’ due to its indistinct psychoactive properties and some adverse effects. Since it appears that mCPP has no particular appeal to users, it is likely that its market in the European Union is driven by supply push rather than demand pull.
The use of new psychoactive substances can have important public health and policy implications, but monitoring emerging trends is a considerable challenge.
New patterns of drug use are difficult to detect because, typically, they first emerge at low levels, and in specific localities or among restricted sub-groups of the population.
Few countries have monitoring systems that are sensitive to this kind of behaviour and the methodological difficulties presented by monitoring this kind of drug use are considerable.
Nonetheless, the importance of identifying potential new threats is widely recognised, and it is indirect response to this that the European Union, through the Council decision on new psychoactive substances, developed an earlywarning system that provides a quick-response mechanism to the emergence of new psychoactive substances on the European drug scene.
Activities in support of the earlywarning system form an important part of the work of the EMCDDA and fit within a broader perspective of using a wide variety of data sources to improve the timeliness and sensitivity of the European drug monitoring system.
EU action on new psychoactive substances
The Council decision on new psychoactive substances (157
During 2007, a total of 15 new psychoactive substances were notified for the first time through the earlywarning system to the EMCDDA and Europol.
The group of newly notified substances is diverse and, besides new synthetic drugs, includes medicinal products and naturally occurring substances.
Nine of the newly reported compounds were synthetic drugs similar to those listed in Schedules I and II of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
They included substances from known chemical groups such as phenethylamines, tryptamines and piperazines, as well as substances with a less common chemical make-up.
The group is equally divided between substances that have pronounced hallucinogenic effects and those that exhibit predominantly stimulant properties.

New substances under control example on the working methods of online shops; the way that they respond to users’ demands, and new trends among young people.
To identify current developments in the online drug market, the EMCDDA conducted a snapshot study in early 2008, which surveyed 25 online shops.
The results of that study a represented here.
Online shops
Since January 2006, 12 countries have reported additions or changes to their lists of controlled substances. mCPP (1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine) has been added to the list of controlled substances in six countries (Belgium, Germany, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Slovakia) and BZP (1-benzylpiperazine) has been added in four countries (Estonia, Italy, Lithuania, Malta).
Of these substances, mCPP had been actively monitored by the EMCDDA and Europol, and BZP had been the subject of a risk assessment in 2007.
Other substances being brought under control in the period include the hallucinogens DOC (4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine), DOI (4-iodo-2,5- dimethoxyamphetamine) and bromo-dragonfly (bromo- benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine) in Denmark and Sweden, and ketamine in Estonia.
Within the European Union, the majority of online shops identified in the snapshot study are based in the UnitedKingdom and the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Germany and Austria.
Online shops often specialise in certain types of drugrelated products, for example some mainly sell drug paraphernalia, some specialise in hallucinogenic mushrooms or ‘party pills’, while others market a wide range of herbal, semi-synthetic and synthetic substances.
Online shops based in Europe advertise over 200 psychoactive products.
The most commonly encountered ‘legal highs’ are Salvia divinorum, kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), Hawaiian baby woodrose (Argyreia nervosa), hallucinogenic mushrooms (EMCDDA, 2006), and a variety of ‘party pills’.
Various plants with psychoactive properties are also being controlled.
To this end, Belgium has restructured its legislation on psychotropic substances to include a new category that lists plants or parts of plants under control, rather than just their psychoactive ingredients as before.
Among the plants placed on the list are khat (qat, Catha edulis) and Salvia divinorum.
Khat is now controlled by 11 countries in Europe (a 2005 risk assessment in the UnitedKingdom recommended against control).
In 2006, Sweden added salvinorine-A, the main active principle of Salvia divinorum, to its list; the plant has also been put under control in Germany in 2008.
In the same period, Tabernanthe iboga has been added to the list of controlled substances in France, following legal control of the active ingredient, ibogaine, in Belgium, Denmark and Sweden.
Finally, in response to deaths associated with hallucinogenic mushrooms, Ireland and the Netherlands have both moved to close earlier loopholes that had allowed sale and possession of fresh mushrooms containing psilocin; in Ireland the law came in to force in January 2006, while in the Netherlands it is in the parliamentary process at the time of writing.
Internet study methodology
For further information, a list of substances controlled across the EU and Norway is presented in the ‘Substances and classifications table’ in the European Legal Database on Drugs (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/ legal-reports).
Internet — a marketplace for psychoactive substances
To obtain a snapshot, Internet searches were conducted in January 2008 using multilingual keywords and the search engine Google (http://www.google.com).
A total of 68 EU-based online shops were identified selling various types of ‘legal highs’.
They were stratified according to their country of origin.
EU country code domains (e.g. ES, FR, DE) or other indications of being EU-based (e.g. contact address) were used for the identification of the country of origin.
More than half of the shops (52%) were located in the United Kingdom, 37% in the Netherlands, 6% in Germany, 4% in Austria and 1% in other countries (e.g. Ireland, Poland).
A random sample of 25 online shops was selected for detailed analysis.
Sampling fractions in each stratum (country of origin) were proportional to those of the total sample of online shops.
Online shops that sold exclusively to the trade, rather than to the consumer, were excluded as were those that sold only hallucinogenic mushrooms.
The Internet offers a window on the world of the drug user through online forums and chat rooms as well as the sites of online shops selling psychoactive alternatives to controlled substances.
Information available can give insights in to different aspects of the online marketplace in drugs, for

Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe in the body, and there is currently no readily available toxicological test to determine which of the two substances has been consumed.
GHB can be readily manufactured from GBL and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD), which are commonly and legally used in many branches of industry (e.g. chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals) and are thus available from commercial suppliers.
The commercial availability of GBL has the potential to make this substance available to drug traffickers and consumers at levels of price and risk much lower than those normally encountered in illicit drug markets in the European Union.
For example, the average price of a 1 gram dose of GBL purchased in bulk on the Internet varies from EUR 0.09 to EUR 2.
The substances offered for sale are advertised to have effects similar to those of controlled drugs. Both Salvia divinorum and Hawaiian baby woodrose, along with the less frequently offered morning glory (Ipomoea violacea) are described as producing hallucinogenic effects similar to those of LSD.
Kratom is often marketed as a substitute for opioids, various preparations are offered as alternatives to cannabis, and ‘party pills’ are sold as alternatives to MDMA. The ‘party pills’ on offer may contain plant material or semi-synthetic or synthetic substances.
The main ingredient of synthetic ‘party pills’ is often benzylpiperazine (BZP), though the online shops appear to have replacement substances ready for when BZP becomes subject to control measures in the EU Member States.
GHB and its precursor GBL: follow-up
In Europe, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) has been under surveillance since 2000, when a risk assessment of the substance was conducted under the terms of the 1997 joint action on new synthetic drugs (EMCDDA, 2002).
The addition of GHB to Schedule IV of the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, in March 2001, obliged all EU Member States to control the drug under their legislation addressing psychotropic substances, and new controls rapidly curtailed the previously open sale of GHB.
Both GHB and GBL have a steep dose–response curve, with rapid onset of symptoms, which greatly increases the risks associated with illicit use.
Nausea, vomiting and various degrees of impaired consciousness are the main adverse affects in most reported cases of GHB intoxication.
However, the frequent presence of other drugs may complicate the clinical presentation.
A Dutch study of 72 GHB users reported that the majority had passed out at least once while on GHB and some had done so frequently (Korf et al., 2002).
In a survey of GHB and GBL users in the United Kingdom, adverse reactions were reported to be more common in club settings than in private homes (Sumnall et al., 2008).
In London and Barcelona, the patient profile for GHB intoxications has been described as mainly young and male, with the majority presenting at weekends, usually with concomitant consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs (Miro et al., 2002; Wood et al., 2008).
GHB occurs naturally in the human body, but is also used as a medicine and as a recreational drug.
Non-medical use of GHB surfaced on the recreational nightlife scene in some parts of Europe, the USA and Australia during the 1990s, specifically in nightclubs where many other drugs were being commonly used.
Concerns quickly arose about the health risks associated with its use.
In particular, anxieties arose about the potential for surreptitiously adding GHB to drinks (commonly referred to as ‘drink spiking’) to facilitate sexual assault.
However, there is a lack of forensic evidence for this, and establishing it is difficult due to the narrow time window for detecting GHB in body fluids.
However, the association of GHB with drug-facilitated sexual assault may have contributed to a relatively ‘negative image’ of the substance (EMCDDA, 2008c).
Intoxications and emergencies associated with GHB have been reported in the scientific literature and to the EMCDDA since the late 1990s, albeit not systematically, in Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, the UnitedKingdom and Norway.
Although GHB is associated with only a very small proportion of all drug intoxication emergencies requiring hospital or ambulance emergency services, numbers appear to have increased since 2000.
In Amsterdam, in 2005, the proportion of requests for emergency assistance that required transportation to hospital was higher for cases related to GHB/GBL than to those involving other drugs.
Concerns are now arising about reports of consumption of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), a precursor of GHB, which is not a scheduled substance in any of the UN drug control conventions.
GBL is rapidly converted in to GHB
In the United Kingdom, one London hospital emergency department — with a catchment area that includes local club venues which typically, but not exclusively, cater for the gay club scene — recorded a total of 158 GHB and
Chapter 8: New drugs and emerging trends
This suggests that GBL use may be more common than was previously thought (Wood et al., 2008).
1,4-BD) under drug control or equivalent legislation and discussions about possible further controls are in progress in the United Kingdom.
In accordance with Community legislation on control of precursors, GBL and 1,4-BD are included in the list of non-controlled substances for which voluntary monitoring measures to prevent their diversion from licit industrial uses are in place in all Member States.
Due to its rapid elimination from the body, it is difficult to establish GHB/GBL as a cause of intoxication or death.
Furthermore, there is an absence of an accurate and comparable system for recording the number of deaths and non-fatal emergencies related to the use of GHB and its precursors.
Responses
Some Member States (Italy, Latvia, Sweden) have chosen to control GBL (or GBL and the other precursor
Interventions for prevention and harmreduction in response to the use of GHB/GBL are commonly provided by national and community drugs projects that target nightlife settings.
These interventions usually consist of training club staff and disseminating information about the risks of using GHB and other drugs.
Such interventions often take place in conjunction with other interventions related to ‘club drugs’ and use of alcohol and drug combinations (EMCDDA, 2008e).

European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
Annual report 2008: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is one of the European Union’s decentralised agencies.
Established in 1993 and based in Lisbon, it is the central source of comprehensive information on drugs and drug addiction in Europe.
The EMCDDA collects, analyses and disseminates factual, objective, reliable and comparable information on drugs and drug addiction.
In doing so, it provides its audiences with an evidencebased picture of the drug phenomenon at European level.
The Centre’s publications area prime source of information for a wide range of audiences including policymakers and their advisers; professionals and researchers working in the field of drugs; and, more broadly, the media and general public.
The annual report presents the EMCDDA’s yearly overview of the drug phenomenon in the EU and is an essential reference book for those seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe.

Furthermore, we make a commitment that the identification of what constitutes effective practice in the drugs field will form an increasingly important part of the EMCDDA’s future activities.
This report provides a timely and detailed assessment of Europe’s drug situation, and we are grateful to our staff who have worked so hard to produce it.
However, we must acknowledge that the strength of this document comes not just from our work here in Lisbon but, more fundamentally, from the efforts within the Member States to develop a sound and comprehensive information system.
As well as making an important contribution to a mature and informed debate on the drug problem, the existence of this monitoring system, we believe, results in better and more effective policies.
Such policies are increasingly necessary, as the challenges in this area grow ever more complex.
A common theme running through this report is the dynamic nature of the drug problem, and we need to ensure that our vision keeps pace with the changing conditions with which we are confronted.
The conference also identified a number of important issues that are echoed in the analysis presented here.
Our information systems need to perform better in identifying, tracking and reporting on new trends.
In achieving this, however, it is essential that our reporting remains accurate, grounded and non-alarmist.
Also highlighted was the need to unite in our analysis both supply-side and demand-side issues.
In this year’s report, we give greater prominence to an analysis of supply-side indicators and the drug market.
We do this cautiously, as insufficient efforts have yet been made to improve the quality, reliability and comparability of the European data set in this area.
This is now widely recognised, and we are committed to working with our national and European partners to address this issue.
This year, the EMCDDA celebrated 15 years of collecting information and reporting on the European drug problem.
To mark this event we held a conference entitled ‘Identifying Europe’s information needs for effective drug policy’.
This provided an opportunity for scientists, professionals and policymakers from across Europe, and beyond, to come to Lisbon to help us map and evaluate the existing knowledge base in the drug field and to identify current and future information needs.
One of the findings of this year’s report is that assessing Europe’s drug situation needs a simultaneous understanding of national features, of subregional specificities and, increasingly, of common European, or even global, trends.
For the future, we need to better describe this complex relationship, as this will help us not only to understand those factors that can promote or inhibit the growth of drug problems, but will also guide us in the development of appropriate interventions.
Finally, it should be noted that the European Union and the United Nations have renewed their drug policy documents almost in parallel in late 2008 and early 2009.
The new EU action plan on drugs and the new UN political declaration and action plan both reflect the international commitment to reduce drug use and the harms it can cause.
To achieve these objectives constitutes a major challenge and will only be achieved if the planned actions are widely implemented.
Monitoring and evaluation are key elements in this process, as they allow us to keep our policies on course and chart the progress made.
The conference demonstrated that Europe has developed as a formidable laboratory to study and understand drug use and drugrelated responses, and this now provides us with considerable opportunities for collective learning and knowledge sharing.
Nowhere else exists such a large group of culturally different countries who demonstrate a common determination in improving their understanding and responses to this complex social problem.
This can be seen in the development of a transversal drug monitoring system that encompasses 30 countries with a combined population of more than half a billion people.
It can also be seen in the EU drugs strategy and action plan, tools that are designed to take stock of the information available and elaborate it into practical and collective action.
This is particularly important now, as our Member States face hard choices about funding priorities, and are ever more focused on the need to gain maximum benefit from the investments that have been made.
We are confident that our current report contributes to this process.

The statistical data reported here relate to the year 2007 (or the last year available).
Graphics and tables in this report may reflect a subset of EU countries; the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest.
Retail prices of drugs reported to the EMCDDA reflect the price to the user.
Reports on purity or potency, from most countries, are based on a sample of all drugs seized, and it is generally not possible to relate the reported data to a specific level of the drug market.
For purity or potency and retail prices, analyses are based on the reported mean or mode or, in their absence, the median.
Reports of the prevalence of drug use based on general population surveys mostly refer to the national population aged from 15 to 64 years.
Countries using different upper or lower age limits include: Bulgaria (18–60), the Czech Republic (18), Denmark (16), Germany (18), Hungary (18–59), Malta (18), Sweden (16) and the United Kingdom (16–59).
Prevalence data for the United Kingdom refers to England and Wales.
In reports on treatment demand, ‘new clients’ refers to those who have entered treatment for the first time in their lives and ‘all clients’ refers to all those entering treatment.
Clients in continuous treatment at the start of the year in question are not included in the data.
Where the proportion of treatment demands for a primary drug is given, the denominator is the number of cases for which the primary drug is known.
Analysis of trends is based only on those countries providing sufficient data to describe changes over the period specified.
Figures for 2006 may substitute for missing 2007 values in trend analysis of drug market data; for the analysis of other trends, missing data may be interpolated.
Trends in price are adjusted for inflation at national level.
Information on the availability and provision of various interventions in Europe is generally based on the informed judgement of national experts, collected through structured questionnaires.

Commentary Hitting a moving target — the challenge of developing a pragmatic policy response to a changing drug problem
Policy consensus permits a more targeted drug action plan to be moving closer to the European model.
A strong consensus also emerged from the UNGASS meeting on the need for effective global monitoring of the drug phenomenon, especially given the continued growth of problems in developing and transitional countries.
The reporting mechanism developed to assess the implementation of the UNGASS action plans has been criticised.
But with its demise, important areas of work, particularly those concerning demand reduction measures remain outside of the existing global reporting framework.
This issue is likely to be an important topic for the forthcoming session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs.
Law enforcement practice confronted by competing policy objectives
This report covers an important period for drug policy, both in Europe and beyond.
In the European Union, we have seen the evaluation of the 2005–08 drug action plan — the fifth since 1990 — and the drafting and launch of its successor, operative for the years 2009–12.
Although attention is often given to the differences that exist between Member States in their drug policies, from a historical perspective the considerable agreement that is now evident in discussions at European level is striking.
Member States may still have distinct policy perspectives, to some extent reflecting distinct national realities; nonetheless, in many areas, the debate appears increasingly mature and consensus driven.
This has permitted a new EU action plan that can be described as pragmatic, focused and targeted.
This approach is concretely illustrated in the attention given to specific areas of practice such as the prevention of drugrelated deaths, working in prison settings and improving the quality of treatment and other interventions.
Drug law enforcement receives a high profile in this year’s annual report, and a ‘Selected issue’ addresses the sentencing and other outcomes of those charged with drug offences.
The number of violations of drug laws reported in Europe continues to grow.
And although the data are difficult to interpret, this observation raises questions about the extent to which law enforcement practice is in step with policy objectives in this area.
Internationally, considerable public and professional interest has been stimulated by the discussions leading up to the adoption of a new United Nations political declaration and plan of action to fight the global drug problem, which followed the review of the goals set at the 1998 Special Session of the General Assembly (UNGASS).
In this debate, Europe has provided a strong voice for drug policies that are balanced, scientifically grounded and humane.
This has helped to ensure that, in the final agreement, the key progressive elements of the original 1998 UNGASS documents were preserved.
Although the UN discussions at times were heated and sometimes reflected entrenched political and ideological positions, there were also signs that a more pragmatic and reasoned approach to identifying what constitutes effective action may be gaining ground.
The USA, for example, softened its approach to the provision of sterile injecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood-borne infections, reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area.
Broadly speaking, the European policy debate has moved towards the view that priority should be given to interdiction activities targeting the supply rather than the use of drugs.
Reflecting this, in some countries the legal penalties applicable to supply-related offences have been raised or minimum tariffs have been introduced.
The extent to which this shift in emphasis away from users and towards drug suppliers is being translated into policing practice is difficult to gauge.
Only in a few countries do offences related to drug supply outnumber those for drug possession.
Overall, the number of supply-related offences has increased; but the number of offences related to possession or use of drugs has also increased, and to an even greater degree.
As well, across Europe the picture for supply-related offences is more mixed, with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium-term data.
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe integrated package of care.
This can be seen, both conceptually and in practice.
For example, harmreduction and treatment interventions are increasingly linked and offered by the same providers.
Despite widespread recognition of the importance of social reintegration, this remains a poorly developed area, and drug users still experience considerable difficulties finding jobs, adequate housing and developing non-drug-related pursuits.
The in-depth review on sentencing for drug law offences in Europe that accompanies this report explores what happens to those who violate drug laws.
Custodial sentences are common for supply-related offences, but they tend to be given at the lower end of the available tariffs, averaging 3 years or less.
This may simply reflect the reality that many of those charged are at the lower end of the supply chain, for example street dealers or addicts who also sell drugs to support their habit.
This finding has implications for the development of minimum sentencing guidelines, if they are intended to deter highlevel career criminals from becoming involved in drug supply.
Although progress has been made in treating drug users in Europe, it is uneven, both in terms of the substances addressed and geographical coverage.
The greatest advances have been seen in the area of opioid substitution treatment, with the treated population now in the region of 650 000 and growing.
However, eastern Europe as a whole only contributes to a small proportion of this total, suggesting that there is a need for an expansion of services in some countries.
A lesson that has emerged from a number of countries is that the involvement of general practitioners can contribute to an expansion of treatment provision.
Shared care arrangements with specialised centres not only provide support to general practitioners, but also assure treatment quality.
In most countries, custodial sentences are rarely handed out for drug use or possession.
That said, a small percentage of those appearing in court will get an immediate prison sentence, possibly because of aggravating circumstances.
This means that increasing numbers of drug users come into contact with the criminal justice system only to receive an administrative or minor sanction.
Leaving aside the possible deterrent effect of this kind of action, it does raise the question as to what extent this contact with certain groups of drug users represents a missed opportunity for other demand reduction activities.
Some countries have developed innovative approaches in this area, but overall these are still rare.
Despite the fact that in most countries it is theoretically possible to continue or start substitution treatment within the prison setting, in practice this is often difficult.
Given the number of drug users within prisons in Europe, there is a pressing need to expand treatment opportunities of all types within this setting.
This fact is recognised in the EU action plan, but currently remains a neglected area in most countries.
As those charged with drug offences are likely to be a diverse group, needs assessment is a particularly important issue for service development in this area.
For healthrelated interventions, these span a continuum from prevention, education and harmreduction approaches, to brief interventions and, when warranted, referral to specialised drug treatment and social support services.
Developing a workable model to ensure appropriate referral trajectories is likely to pose an organisational challenge. Portugal has addressed this problem somewhat differently.
The use of drugs is no longer subject to criminal sanctions, and those found in possession of drugs are directly referred for needs assessment to a special tribunal, known as a ‘commission for dissuasion of drug abuse’.
The tribunal can issue fines, but sanctioning is not its main objective.
For drugs other than opioids, the availability of services and our understanding of what constitutes effective care are less well developed in Europe.
However, this problem has begun to be recognised, with a growing number of European research projects and pilot programmes now addressing the treatment needs of stimulant and cannabis users.
In addition, developments in neuroscience have not only improved our understanding of the biological mechanisms of addiction, but are now beginning to facilitate some innovative approaches.
Examples here include a cocaine vaccine, now undergoing a large-scale trial in Europe.
Developments in information technology have also facilitated innovation, such as Internet-based treatment programmes and the use of text messaging.
Treatment and health interventions: from ‘one fits all’ towards a toolbox of targeted measures
Services for drug users in Europe are becoming increasingly diversified and offered as part of an

The estimates presented here relate to the adult population (15–64 years old) and are based on the most recent data available.
For the complete set of data and information on the methodology see the accompanying statistical bulletin.
Lifetime prevalence: at least 74 million (22 % of European adults)
Last year use: about 22.5 million European adults or a third of lifetime users
Country variation in last year use: overall range 0.4 % to 14.6 %
Cocaine of all European adults report having used the drug at least once.
Subsequently, the situation began to stabilise, and the most recent data strongly support the analysis presented in last year’s report, of an overall decline in the use of this drug.
Of particular interest are the latest results from the ‘European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs’, which provide a window on time trends in drug use among schoolchildren.
Patterns found here are likely later to feed through into older age cohorts.
Interestingly, just as different temporal patterns could be seen in the upward trend in cannabis use in the past, this pattern now appears to be repeating itself in reverse.
The United Kingdom, for example, one of the first countries to record high prevalence levels was also one of the earliest to report a decline in use.
This pattern is now seen in most other west European countries.
In eastern Europe, levels of use were still increasing in most countries until recently.
However, even in these countries, there are signs of stabilisation in the youth population and, if the pattern seen elsewhere is repeated, a subsequent decline could be expected.
Understanding the factors that influence the popularity of a drug such as cannabis is clearly important.
However, caution should be used in inferring any simple causal explanations.
National and EU policy may have played a part in influencing these trends; but declining levels of use are also seen in the USA and Australia, suggesting that broader sociocultural factors are likely to be important.
Standing out in the European picture is a small group of countries, mainly in the north or south of Europe, where levels of cannabis use have remained low and stable for some time.
Understanding the protective factors operating in those countries would also be of great interest; but again analysis will need to take full account of cultural, social and historical factors, as well as considering the influence of drug and social policies.
Lifetime prevalence: about 12 million (3.5 % of European adults)
Last year use: around 2 million or a sixth of lifetime users Last month use: less than 1 million
Country variation in last year use: overall range 0.0 % to 1.3 %
Problem opioid users: estimated at between 1.2 and 1.5 million Europeans
Druginduced deaths accounted for 4 % of all deaths of Europeans aged 15–39, with opioids being found in around three quarters
Principal drug in more than 50 % of all drug treatment requests
About 650 000 opioid users received substitution treatment in 2007
In contrast to the data on overall levels of use, the most recent analysis of patterns of problematic cannabis use in Europe is more mixed and less encouraging.
A caveat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and, though some progress is being made in this direction, we must rely on more indirect measures.
The number of new cannabis treatment demands may now be stabilising, after rising steadily for several years.
Although to what extent this reflects patterns of use or the capacity of services remains unclear.
Currently, the best behavioural indicator of problem cannabis use is provided by extrapolation from estimates of the number of daily users of the drug. Trends in daily use are difficult to assess, but the data available do not point to any overall decline.
The EMCDDA estimates that somewhere between 2 % and 2.5 % of young adults are using cannabis on a daily
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Heroin and cocaine: no strong signs of a diminishing problem trend in heroin-related problems is no longer sustained.
And, while there is currently no evidence of a return to the epidemic spread of heroin use seen in the past, the health and social problems arising from the use of this drug are considerable.
Any indications that the situation may be worsening, especially as Europe enters a period of economic difficulties, are grounds for considerable concern.
Polydrug use and concomitant alcohol problems are now the defining elements of the European drug problem
In drug prevention, it has long been understood that substance use problems are best addressed holistically and in the context of healthy lifestyles and informed choices.
In contrast, the discourse on drug use is more often substance specific.
It is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one-dimensional perspective is becoming increasingly unhelpful in understanding the developing nature of patterns of substance use in Europe.
Individuals who use drugs almost never restrict their consumption to a single substance.
In Europe today, polydrug patterns are the norm, and the combined use of different substances is responsible for, or complicates, most of the problems we face.
And it applies equally to the drug market.
Actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly devalued if they simply open the door for the use of a substitute, which may be even more damaging.
There is little to suggest an improving situation in the use of heroin and cocaine, the two substances that remain at the heart of Europe’s drug problem.
That said, drawing any clear picture in this area is complicated by difficulties in reconciling the information coming from different indicators.
This problem is particularly apparent for cocaine, where as well as a fall in estimated production, the volume of the drug seized in the European Union has fallen in the most recent data, as has the purity of the drug at street level in most countries.
In the United Kingdom, a country with a large cocaine market, recent falls in purity have been considerable.
These data could suggest declining cocaine availability, but other information puts this conclusion into question.
The number of seizures of the drug is still increasing, prices are falling, and there are suggestions of a switch to new trafficking routes through eastern Europe, which may have impeded interdiction efforts.
However, there is evidence of the further diffusion of the drug into other countries. Treatment demands related to cocaine are also growing.
From the evidence available, it is possible to conclude that current consumption levels remain high and not diminishing in established areas and are continuing to grow elsewhere; but there are indications that suppliers may be experiencing difficulties in meeting consumer demand in some major markets.
It will be interesting to see if the future brings more concrete evidence of a decrease in the availability of this drug after recent reports of a decline in global cocaine production.
Heroin still accounts for the greatest share of morbidity and mortality related to drug use in Europe.
Use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid-to-late 1990s, but today the picture is less clear, and in some areas raises concerns.
Following marked decreases, the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002, with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and proportion of treatment demands related to opioid drugs.
Data on drugrelated deaths, which are largely associated with heroin use, also provide no indication of a return to the decreasing trend observed prior to 2004.
Data on the numbers of drug law offences and seizures also show increases.
Worryingly, a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people, suggesting that the drug could be diffusing into new populations.
Altogether, it must be viewed as disappointing that the positive analysis of the declining
This year’s annual report is accompanied by a ‘Selected issue’ on polydrug use, which explores how the use of multiple substances impacts across different groups of drug users.
Among the young, multiple substance consumption can increase the risks of acute problems and is predictive of developing a chronic drug habit in later life.
Among older, regular drug users, polydrug use is a major issue in drug overdose, it complicates drug treatment and is associated with violence and offending.
The choice of drugs available to consumers in Europe is also growing.
Noted in the current report are: the increasing range of largely uncontrolled substances targeting the cannabis market; innovation in the production of synthetic drugs; and increasing worries about the misuse of prescription medicines.
Additionally, it has become recognised that a defining factor in Europe’s substance use problem is the concomitant consumption of alcohol.
This too can be seen across every age group.
Among schoolchildren, the latest data show a strong association between binge drinking and drug use. Binge
Commentary: responding to Europe’s changing drug problem drinking also often goes hand in hand with recreational drug use, increasing the risks of negative outcomes among young adults.
Within the chronic drug-using population, alcohol abuse is so common it often goes without mention, and the need to address coexisting alcohol dependence has become an increasingly important issue for drug treatment centres.
Alcohol problems can be particularly deleterious for those addicted to opioid drugs, as they may already have compromised liver function through hepatitis infection and the risk of overdose is elevated.
Innovation and precursor availability: interacting factors that are having a growing impact on the market for synthetic drugs
The EMCDDA is observing an increasingly complex and volatile situation in the availability and use of synthetic drugs in Europe.
The illicit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes, new products and marketing opportunities, as well as demonstrating the ability to adapt quickly to control measures.
In addition, the growing sophistication of the marketing of ‘legal alternatives’ to illicit drugs represents a worrying development.
effects on the availability and use of other substances.
For example, there are some signs that methamphetamine may be displacing amphetamine in parts of northern Europe.
Again, market factors and precursor chemicals appear important here, with methamphetamine production sites appearing now to be located in Lithuania, whose geographical position facilitates the import of precursors, in this case 1-phenyl-2-propanone (BMK), from outside of the European Union.
The situation in Nordic countries adds to concerns about the possible outward diffusion of methamphetamine use beyond the Czech Republic.
In this country, methamphetamine problems are long established, but with production usually on a small scale for personal or local consumption.
A number of central European countries now also report some methamphetamine use, and Europol reports that a few larger production sites have been detected and dismantled in other parts of Europe.
There is also some evidence that methamphetamine use is growing quickly in some of the countries bordering the European Union.
To date, the drug has failed to make inroads into the large market for stimulant drugs in western Europe, where cocaine or amphetamine use still dominates.
Nonetheless, given the relative ease with which methamphetamine can be produced and the considerable negative impact that this drug can have on public health, there is no room for complacency.
The speed at which problems can develop is illustrated by Slovakia, which provides a recent case study of a country where methamphetamine use has grown significantly.
The Internet and marketing: is ‘spice’ a taste of things to come?
An example of market volatility can be seen in recent developments in the availability of ecstasy.
Until 2007, most ecstasy tablets analysed in Europe contained 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) or another ecstasy-like substance.
However, initial data from the early-warning system from the beginning of 2009 suggest that this may be changing in some Member States, such as Denmark and the Netherlands.
In up to half of all tablets analysed in these countries, no MDMA or any of its analogues were found.
Rather, the pills contained 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) either alone or in combination with another psychoactive substance. Though mCPP is not listed in the UN conventions, it has been subject to control measures in some EU Member States.
The reasons for the current market change are not completely clear, but a shortage of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone (PMK), a main precursor for the synthesis of MDMA, is a possible explanation.
It cannot yet be said if this development is a temporary digression or marks a more significant transition in the ecstasy market.
The EU early-warning system has been monitoring mCPP since 2005, and the EMCDDA and Europol follow developments in this area closely and will produce a report on the market in 2010.
Changes in the ecstasy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals, and these efforts may also have important
This year, the EMCDDA launched a first review of Internet treatment approaches, and it appears that, for some forms of prevention, treatment and harmreduction interventions, the web-based approaches have considerable potential.
Less positively, there are difficulties apparent in regulating this virtual and global phenomenon, and the Internet can be used to promote the use of psychoactive substances.
Added to the concerns raised by the online marketing of alcohol and medicines are those about the appearance of a range of supposedly ‘legal’ alternatives to controlled psychoactive substances.
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe obscure research compounds, some are extremely potent, and little is known about their effects on humans.
This market has grown over the last few years, and now includes a wide range of plant-based products, in particular herbal mixtures, as well as merchandise containing synthetic compounds.
New substances appearing on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world, to experimental chemicals synthesised in laboratories and untested in humans.
Other innovations include the development of distinct brands and the use of attractive packaging.
A notable example of this is the herbal mixtures that have been marketed under the ‘spice’ label.
Numerous brands of ‘spice’ have been found with different packaging and different ingredient lists.
Forensic analysis, however, has largely failed to detect the plant-based substances declared on the labels, but did identify in some samples synthetic cannabinoids that had been added to the mixtures.
These substances were not among the listed ingredients, and would therefore have been consumed unknowingly.
The cannabinoids found are relatively
Attempts to circumvent drug control by marketing unregulated substitutes are not new.
What is new is the wide range of substances now being explored, the aggressive marketing of products that have been intentionally mislabelled, the growing use of the Internet, and the speed at which the market reacts to control measures.
‘Spice’ may also provide us with a warning of problems to come.
The ability of sophisticated chemists, often located outside of European jurisdictions, to cheaply conduct organic synthesis, potentially provides access to a considerable number of psychoactive substances.
This can bring into the picture whole new chemical groups, comprising many analogues, which can be difficult to detect and pose considerable difficulties for control policies based on individual compounds.
Moreover, as some of these substances may have legitimate uses or be sold supposedly for legitimate purposes, they can fall between drug control and trade regulation.
Narcotic Drugs in Vienna (
Other topics addressed are the recent adoption and evaluation of national drug strategies and action plans, new data and trends on drugrelated public expenditure and developments regarding drugrelated research in Europe.
For some nations, the problem declined but for others it worsened, in some cases substantially.
International and EU policy developments
New UN political declaration and plan of action
According to the study, illicit drug markets are not vertically integrated or dominated by major dealers or cartels.
While sales of illicit drugs are estimated to generate more than EUR 100 billion, the vast majority of those involved in the drug trade make modest incomes.
A few individuals make great fortunes, but these account for only a small portion of the total revenue.
A convergence of national drug policies is reported by the study, with demand reduction receiving increasing emphasis and harm reduction finding wider acceptance.
Policies towards sellers and traffickers have toughened.
A new UN political declaration and plan of action (1) was adopted at a highlevel political meeting during this year’s session of the United Nations’ Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND).
This was the outcome of a year-long reflection, undertaken as part of the 10-year review of the progress made in reaching the goals and targets set in 1998 during the twentieth UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on the world drug problem.
The enforcement of drug prohibition is judged by the study to have caused substantial unintended harm; much of which could have been predicted (e.g. geographical displacement of production and trafficking).
(1) European Commission, ‘Report on global illicit drug markets, 2009’ (available at: http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/doc_ centre/drugs/studies/doc_drugs_studies_en.htm).
The European Union and its Member States played a leading role in the UNGASS review.
Europe’s position on the UN drug policy to emerge from the review process was expressed in a common position paper drafted by the Council of the European Union.
The paper stressed the importance of public health as the first principle of
Political declaration and plan of action on international cooperation towards an integrated and balanced strategy to counter the world drug problem.
Its overall aim is to reduce significantly the prevalence of drug use among the population and to reduce the social and health damage caused by the use of and trade in illicit drugs.
The new EU action plan identifies five key priorities that reflect its areas of action: improving coordination, cooperation and raising public awareness; reducing the demand for drugs; reducing the supply of drugs; improving international cooperation; and, improving the understanding of the problem. The new plan is more
EU drugs action plan (2009–12): new features
The new UN document is similar in content to the original UNGASS declarations and action plans agreed in 1998.
It includes many of the elements put forward by the European Union, as can be seen in the plan of action, which reviews current drug policy problems and lists the actions that UN Member States have committed themselves to implementing during the next decade.
Among the key actions and objectives under the heading of drug demand reduction are: better respect of human rights, increased accessibility of services and improved targeting of vulnerable groups.
A better balance in drug policies, in favour of drug demand reduction, and the implementation of evidence-based interventions, as well as monitoring and quality assurance mechanisms, are also called for.
However, the UN document does not explicitly acknowledge the contribution of harm reduction, an approach that has been pursued in Europe under scientific scrutiny.
The participation of civil society in drug policy receives additional attention in the new EU drugs action plan.
Through setting up a ‘European Action on Drugs’, the action plan aims to stimulate European civil society’s commitment about and action on drug problems.
The action plan also calls on Member States to involve civil society at all appropriate levels of drug policy.
In September 2008, the European Commission published its final evaluation of the 2005–08 EU drugs action plan (2
It also examined the action plan’s impact on the national drug policies of EU Member States and looked at recent trends in Europe’s drug situation.
The focus on the quality of interventions in the areas of prevention, treatment, harm reduction and rehabilitation has been reinforced through actions calling for the drafting and exchange of guidelines, good practices and quality standards, and for the development of EU minimum quality standards or benchmarks in these fields.
The prison setting also receives additional attention under the heading of drug demand reduction, with actions calling on Member States to provide services for drug users in prison equivalent to those existing outside prison, to implement follow-up care after release from prison and, overall, to improve the monitoring of drug problems and drug services in this setting.
Most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial cooperation between Member States, often through increased use of EU bodies, projects and tools.
Reducing the diversion and trafficking of drug precursors within and through Europe is the subject of seven different actions, with a broadly operational focus.
The evaluation found that while not all actions had been fully implemented and not all objectives attained, progress had been made in almost all areas of the action plan.
Moreover, the fact that most national drug policy documents contain objectives that echo those of the EU action plan was noted as evidence of increasing convergence among European countries in the field of drug policy.
A relative stabilisation of Europe’s drug situation in recent years was also observed, but the contribution of the EU action plan to this trend could not be determined.
In the area of international cooperation, a stronger emphasis is placed on alternative development, with three actions calling for intensified financial and political support for such programmes.
A better reflection of the balanced approach between demand and supply reduction is also pursued in external agreements and programmes.
Overall, despite some operational shortcomings, the EU drugs action plan was judged to have added value in three distinct areas: in committing Member States and EU institutions to achieving common objectives; in providing a framework for coordination and for developing a coherent approach in the drug field; and as a policy model at international level.
The final evaluation of the drug action plan informed the drafting of its successor, the EU drugs action plan (2009–12), which was endorsed by the European Council
Under the heading of information, research and evaluation, a new action calls for the development of key indicators and strategies for the collection of data on drugrelated crime, illegal cultivation, drug markets and supply reduction interventions.
Increased emphasis is also placed on strengthening research in the drugs field and on developing drug policy evaluation both at national and at EU level.
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor, with only about half the number of objectives (24) and fewer actions (72).
It also contains objectives and actions that were not present in the earlier action plan (4
evaluator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012, and this will be followed by a period of reflection in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents.
National drug strategies and action plans
Civil society and drug policymaking
Drug strategies and action plans are now essential instruments of national drug policies in Europe.
All but one of the 30 countries monitored by the EMCDDA have adopted such documents, which they renew periodically.
In 2008, new drug policy documents (6) were adopted by Greece, France and the United Kingdom.
A key priority of the plan is to dissuade young people from beginning to use drugs by reaffirming the prohibition of drug use and informing young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use.
The involvement of nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) in the preparatory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy.
In May 2008, the European Commission’s Civil Society Forum on Drugs debated the first results of the evaluation of the EU drug action plan (2005–08) and discussed the needs and possible contents of the following action plan (European Commission, 2008a).
Ten other EU Member States had national drug policy documents expiring in 2008.
Spain adopted a new drug strategy in February 2009, and eight other countries (Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Cyprus, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia) were in the process of finalising and adopting new drug strategies and action plans during the first half of 2009; Latvia extended its 2005–08 programme with a 1-year action plan.
The Netherlands also plan to replace their 1995 white paper on drug policy in 2009, while several countries will see at least one of their policy documents coming to the end of its term during this year (Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Turkey).
The contribution of NGOs to the progress made in achieving the goals set at the 1998 UNGASS was reviewed by the Vienna NGO Committee on Narcotic Drugs, with financial support from the European Commission and several EU Member States.
See ‘EU drugs action plan (2009–12): new features’ p. 19. http://www.vngoc.org/details.php?id_cat=8 & id_cnt=56The term ‘national drugpolicy document’ means any official document approved by a government that defines general principles and specific interventions or objectives in the field of drugs, where officially represented as a drug strategy, action plan, programme or other policy document.
policy documents.
In most cases, a progress report based on data collected from service providers and ministries involved in drug policy is submitted to the government or parliament.
Most countries have thereby already started to implement Action 70 of the EU drugs action plan (2009–12), which calls upon EU Member States to evaluate and fine-tune their national drug policies on a regular or ongoing basis.
The total drugrelated public expenditure in Europe has been estimated at EUR 34 billion for 2005 (EMCDDA, 2008a).
The difficulties in information collection in this area are illustrated by the fact that among the 23 countries reporting data for 2007, only the Czech Republic was able to give a breakdown of expenditure across all levels of government.
Most countries could provide data on central government expenditure, and seven also reported expenditure by regional or local government (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Austria, Finland, Croatia) or from social security funds (Germany).
Labelled and unlabelled expenditure
A similar assessment can be made regarding the final evaluation of national drug strategies and action plans, with more than 20 countries reporting that they are currently preparing or have recently carried out such an evaluation.
In some cases, the final report is a summary of annual implementation reviews; in others, there is an attempt to get a deeper understanding of the implementation process, of the effectiveness or of the impact of the policy.
Of the countries taking the more in-depth approach to evaluation, two (Luxembourg, Cyprus) have decided to work with external evaluators from outside the country.
Labelled expenditure is the planned drugrelated public expenditure made by the general government of the state.
It reflects the voluntary commitment of the state in the field of drugs and can be traced back by a detailed review of public budgets.
Of the 23 countries providing data for 2007, 16 reported only labelled expenditure.
Drug policy evaluations face considerable difficulties in their attempts to link the outputs of drug strategies or action plans with changes in the drug situation.
Among these are problems in assessing the effects of large sets of actions and the limited understanding of the influence of key contextual elements, such as drug markets or trends in drug use and lifestyles among young people.
Nevertheless, attempts to establish links between drug strategies or action plans and indicators of the drug situation have been made by some European countries.
And this should become more common in the future, with the new EU drugs action plan (2009–12) calling for the development of instruments to measure the effectiveness and impact of drug policies.
The EMCDDA is also developing guidelines to help Member States assess and interpret the results of their drug policy documents.
Public expenditure
Not all drugrelated expenditure is identified as such in national budgets.
In most countries, the amount expended in some drugrelated activities is embedded in other programmes and interventions (e.g. overall police operations budget, or interventions targeting both licit and illicit substances).
In these cases, such ‘unlabelled expenditure’ must be estimated by a cost-modelling approach.
The results of earlier studies show that, in most cases, unlabelled expenditure represents the greater part of the national expenditure on the drugs problem.
Detailed, reliable information on drugrelated public expenditure is needed by policymakers in order to assess the actual allocation of resources in this area and, ultimately, the cost–benefit relations of drug policy.
Estimating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illicit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use.
Estimates of public expenditure are based on government budgets and accountancy documents.
However, estimating the total expenditure incurred in implementing national
Public expenditure related to drugs can be categorised according to the classification of the functions of government (COFOG) system (EMCDDA, 2008e).
Three countries submitted labelled expenditure classified to the first level of COFOG (Luxembourg, Finland, United Kingdom for England only), with only the United Kingdom including figures for ‘general public services’, ‘education’ and ‘social protection’ (7).
In these three countries, ‘health’ received the highest proportion of the total disbursement, followed by ‘public order and safety’ (Table 1).
In contrast, for those countries providing COFOG data for unlabelled
The COFOG classification has three hierarchical levels. At the first level, government expenditure is broken down into 10 functions.

Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 (OJ L 165, 3.7.2003, p. 31).
Needle and syringe programmes
European Legal Database on Drugs
The European Legal Database on Drugs (ELDD) is the EMCDDA’s online database of information on European drugs-related legislation for the Member States and Norway.
The ELDD provides legal texts in their original formats, profiles of the drug laws in each country and detailed reports on specific topics.
In its Topic overviews, it also provides summaries of the legal position on selected subjects including illegal drug trafficking, substitution treatment, and needle and syringe programmes (1).
Laws reported in Europe in the early part of the last 10 years were largely aimed at providing a legal basis for such interventions (Slovenia in 1999, Poland in 2001, Finland in 2003), or to define or facilitate access rights to needle and syringe programmes (Belgium and France in 1998, Finland in 2003).
The focus of legislation quickly shifted to regulating these programmes, with Belgium, Portugal and Luxembourg passing specific, detailed laws or decrees in 2000, 2001 and 2003 respectively that regulated who may carry out such schemes and whether or not dispensing machines are permitted. In Portugal, the regulatory framework was extended in 2007 to include needle and syringe programmes in prisons.
tightened the legislation on sentencing of traffickers, limiting their rights to conditional release. Changes to the Estonian Criminal Code, in 2002 and 2004, increased the maximum penalties for traffickers of small quantities from 3 to 5 years, and of large quantities from 5 to 10 years.
In Denmark, the penalties for trafficking were raised from 6 to 10 years and, for trafficking large amounts or particularly dangerous substances, from 10 to 16 years. Also in 2004, Lithuania increased penalties for basic trafficking offences from a maximum of 2 years to between 2 and 8 years, and for a large amount from between 2 and 8 years to between 8 and 10 years.
Some countries have adopted legislation to address concerns that needle and syringe programmes could possibly be in conflict with legal provisions intended to criminalise the ‘facilitation’ or ‘incitement’ to use drugs.
In Belgium and Germany, this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exempts certain programmes from any such charge, although limits may be placed on the number of syringes dispensed.
In a few countries, guidance is issued to the police on appropriate law enforcement practice near needle and syringe outlets.
Overall, police confiscation of sterile syringes or needles is reported to be rare across the European Union.
Penalties for trafficking
Over the last 10 years, EU Member States have indicated both individually and collectively that drug trafficking offences should be punished more severely, even if the offences themselves are defined differently in the laws of almost 30 countries.
‘Trafficking’ offences may include production or cultivation, import and export, transporting, offering, selling and/or possession, with intent to distribute or supply, or the concept of acting ‘for gain’ or ‘on a commercial basis’.
In October 2004, the Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA set out minimum provisions of criminal acts and penalties for trafficking.
Since then, four more countries have passed laws to bring basic trafficking penalties into line with the decision.
In 2006, the Netherlands raised the maximum penalty for trafficking of large quantities of drugs from 4 to 6 years, while Poland increased the penalties for possession of large quantities and supply to minors from a maximum of 5 years to a maximum of 8 years, setting also a minimum period of 6 months.
In Slovakia, the basic penalty for trafficking was increased from between 2 and 8 years to between 4 and 10 years, with the maximum penalty for larger amounts increasing from 10 to 15 or even 20 years.
Finally, in Austria, the maximum penalty for giving narcotic substances to others, or cultivation of some narcotic plants, was increased in 2007 from 6 to 12 months’ imprisonment.
Penalties for more serious offences were not changed, though the definition of a large quantity was reduced from 25 to 15 times the threshold quantity.
In the period 1999–2004, six countries passed laws increasing the penalties for certain drug trafficking offences.
In 1999, Ireland created the new offence of possession of a large amount of drugs (worth more than EUR 12 700) with intent to supply, which would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment.
In 2000, the United Kingdom introduced a minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment for a third conviction of trafficking in class A drugs, and in 2001 Greece
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe research efforts in those priority areas that are underrepresented, in particular drug supply.
Analysis of drugs research in the European Union published by the EMCDDA in 2008 (10).
This year, references to national research in the latest Reitox reports are analysed to provide an insight into the research recently conducted in European countries.
Also reported on in this section is a study on drugrelated research in the EU released this year by the European Commission.
Research projects in Member States
European countries referred to more than 350 research projects undertaken or published in 2007 and 2008 in the latest Reitox national reports.
The United Kingdom referred to the highest number of research projects, over 80, followed by Germany and the Netherlands, each with over 30, and the Czech Republic, Ireland and Finland, with over 20.
Drug supply is also among the areas identified as being underrepresented in current research by a study carried out for the European Commission entitled ‘Comparative analysis of research into illicit drugs in the European Union’.
The report noted prevention, legal frameworks and interdiction as other fields disproportionately underresearched, while research on epidemiological topics was found to be more common (11).
The study found that, although comprehensive expertise exists in Member States, improved data comparability between countries and increased visibility of research should be pursued.
Research on responses to the drug situation accounted for more than one third of the recent studies, while another third focused on prevalence, incidence and patterns of drug use, and one fifth on the consequences of drug use.
Among the subject areas that appeared to attract considerably less research attention were: determinants and risk and protective factors, mechanisms and effects of drugs, supply and markets, and methodological issues.
The results of this analysis, while limited in scope, give support to the new EU action plan’s calls for increased
Participation in European research activities was found to vary considerably between countries, with much of the international cooperation taking place on an informal basis.
However, the study emphasised that drugrelated research can be facilitated by European and international networks of researchers.
Research capacity, overall quality and funding availability vary widely in the EU, and there is a considerable need for capacity building and for funding to cover a broader range of policy areas linked to the EU drug action plan.

Introduction in all these countries.
The effectiveness of this type of intervention, however, is not supported by the available evidence.
However, interventions with better scientific foundations, such as prevention programmes following standardised protocols, are now reported from additional countries (Czech Republic, Cyprus, Austria, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia).
This chapter presents an overview of the responses to drug problems in Europe, where possible highlighting trends, developments and quality issues.
Prevention measures are first reviewed followed by interventions in the areas of treatment, harm reduction and social reintegration.
Taken together, all these measures form a comprehensive drug demand reduction system.
They can be considered as complementary, and are sometimes provided in combination and by the same facilities.
This is, for example, increasingly the case for treatment and harm reduction measures.
The limited number of prevention programmes of proven effectiveness is being addressed in Europe by the EU-Dap study (www.eudap.net).
Involving 7 000 students aged 12–14 in seven European countries, the study is evaluating a programme based on the comprehensive social influence approach, which combines training in life-skills with normative education and knowledge acquisition on substances.
The responses developed in the framework of drug law enforcement are also addressed in a new section which includes the most recent data on drug law offences.
The chapter ends with a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting.
Drug prevention can be divided into different levels or strategies, which range from targeting society as a whole (environmental prevention) to focusing on at-risk individuals (indicated prevention).
Ideally, the different strategies do not compete but complement each other.
The following overview focuses on recent developments and on newly reported results of controlled trials in the prevention field.
The EU-Dap results are influenced by gender, with the overall effectiveness of the programme being accounted for by its effect on boys only. It is not clear if this is because girls are less at risk or if they did not respond to the programme.
Gender-dependent effects also came up in a Danish controlled trial on a life-skills programme.
Girls accounted for the largest effect in terms of bullying, past-week and past-month alcohol consumption, while boys accounted for the largest effect for drinking more than five drinks on one occasion and having tried cannabis.
Universal prevention addresses entire populations.
It aims to deter or delay the onset of drug use and drugrelated problems by providing young people with the information and skills necessary to avoid starting to use drugs.
Prevention measures undertaken in Europe are now, for the first time, being systematically monitored by the majority of Member States.
A controlled trial in Prague compared a communitybased programme, which included an educational component, a peer approach, life skills training and parent programmes, against the standard ‘minimum preventive programme’ in schools (Miovský et al., 2007).
The communitybased programme was more effective in reducing alcohol use and affecting attitudes towards substance use among pupils aged 13–15, especially in certain vulnerable groups of children, including those from single-parent families.
Selective and indicated prevention
New information on selective prevention targeting ethnic groups has been reported by Belgium and Luxembourg.
Both selective and indicated prevention acknowledge that problem drug use is concentrated in vulnerable groups or individuals with limited social and personal opportunities (EMCDDA, 2008c).
Selective prevention intervenes with specific groups, families or communities, where people, due to their scarce social ties and resources, may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency.
The evidence base for this approach is presented in a new section of the EMCDDA’s Best practice portal (12).
Indicated prevention aims to identify individuals with behavioural or psychological problems that may be predictive for developing problem substance use later in life, and to target them individually with special interventions.
Substance-specific mass media campaigns
Substance-specific mass media campaigns targeting cannabis use (Denmark, Ireland, France, Netherlands, United Kingdom) and, more recently, cocaine use (Ireland, Spain, United Kingdom) have been developed in Europe.
New indicated prevention projects are reported only from Germany, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden, and they continue to be very rare in Europe despite information about their effectiveness (EMCDDA, 2009b).
Current examples of indicated prevention projects in Europe include the Parent Management Training-Oregon model, which is implemented in the Netherlands and Norway for parents of children aged 4–12 with disruptive behaviour disorder.
Similarly, the ‘Komet för föräldrar’ method, which is used in nearly 30 % of Sweden’s municipalities, targets parents of children showing externalising behaviour problems combined with difficulties in establishing positive peer relations.
A randomised controlled trial involving 159 families showed significantly improved competences in parenting among participating parents and reduced behavioural problems among their children.
Almost all these campaigns warn of the dangers of using the drug, and some of them use shock tactics.
Only two campaigns take a different approach.
The United Kingdom–Colombian campaign ‘Shared responsibility’ addresses the responsibility of users for the environmental and social harm associated with cocaine production.
The Dutch cannabis campaign in 2006 targeted normative beliefs with real-life stories of young people as positive role models, instead of warnings and depiction of use.
Its evaluation found that negative social norms against cannabis smoking were reinforced and that there were no negative effects on intention to use and on normative beliefs (Wammes et al., 2007).
Around 400 000 drug users are reported to have entered drug treatment in 2007 (14).
Overall, the great majority of treatment demands (86 %) were made in outpatient treatment centres.
This proportion has grown in recent years for various reasons, including the increased availability and diversification of specialised outpatient treatment.
Mass media campaigns highlighting the danger of drug use are only rarely evaluated for changes in behaviour, attitudes or intention to use drugs.
In addition, concerns have been expressed about their poor effectiveness and possible harm.
For example, a thorough evaluation of the outcome of the US national cannabis campaign revealed no overall effects.
There was, however, evidence that the campaign had unintended effects in favour of cannabis, and individuals who had previously been uninterested in the drug, reported an intention to use it (Hornik et al., 2008).
Similar problems were reported in the evaluation of the Scottish cocaine campaign ‘Know the score’ (EMCDDA, 2007a).
Decision-making by young people is a complex process, strongly influenced by peer group interactions and perception of social norms.
So far, mass media communication appears not to have responded effectively to this complexity.
In Europe, the main modalities used for the treatment of drug problems are psychosocial interventions, opioid substitution and detoxification.
Psychosocial interventions offer support to users as they attempt to manage and overcome their drug problems.
These interventions include counselling, motivational enhancement, cognitivebehavioural therapy, case management, group and family therapy and relapse prevention.
Psychosocial interventions form the foundation of communitybased outpatient and inpatient treatment, and they also normally complement opioid substitution treatment. Drug detoxification is a

Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe short-term, medically supervised intervention aimed at resolving the withdrawal symptoms associated with chronic drug use.
It is generally provided in inpatient settings.
The relative size of the different treatment modalities in each country is influenced by several factors, including the organisation of the national health care system.
Outpatient treatment
Outpatient psychosocial treatment is mostly provided by public institutions (16 countries) or by nongovernmental organisations (10 countries).
According to national experts, this type of treatment is available to the majority of those who seek it in 10 countries, and available to nearly all of them in a further 13 countries.
In four countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Romania, Turkey), however, outpatient psychosocial treatment is estimated to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it (see Figure 1A).
These ratings may hide considerable variation within countries and differences in the availability of specialised treatment programmes for cannabis or cocaine users.
In 2007, opioids, chiefly heroin, continued to be the main drug reported by users entering treatment in outpatient settings, cited as primary drug by 54 % of clients, followed by cannabis (21 %) and cocaine (18 %).
Substitution treatment combined with psychosocial care is the predominant treatment option for opioid users in Europe.
It is generally provided as an outpatient treatment, though in some countries it is also available in inpatient settings.
For example, in Austria, 65 % of clients undergoing long-term inpatient treatment are prescribed slow-release morphine.
Substitution treatment is also increasingly provided in prisons (17).
Drug users entering treatment in outpatient settings are predominantly young men, with an average age of 31 years and males almost four times as numerous as females (3.7:1).
The age and sex profile of treatment clients varies with primary drug.
Cannabis clients are on average much younger (25) than opioid (32) and cocaine (33) clients.
Regardless of primary drug, the average age of clients entering treatment for the first time is about 2 years lower than that of all clients.
With the introduction of high-dosage buprenorphine treatment in Cyprus in 2007, opioid substitution treatment is now available in all EU Member States, as well as Croatia and Norway (18).
In Turkey, substitution treatment has yet to be introduced, though it is permitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres. In 16 countries, specialised public outpatient services are the main providers of substitution treatment.
See Tables HSR-1 and HSR-2 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.See Table HSR-3 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.

rehabilitating them into society. A therapeutic community approach is often used in this context.
Inpatient drug treatment is also provided by psychiatric hospitals, notably for clients with co-morbid psychiatric disorders.
Inpatient treatment
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Guidelines are becoming an important tool in the quality assurance of drug treatment.
Treatment guidelines include recommendations based on scientific evidence, expert opinion, service user preferences and national health care systems.
They are designed to help choose and apply the appropriate drug treatment interventions.
In 20 out of 27 reporting countries, national drug treatment guidelines are drawn up by an authorised institution.
The mean age of drug users entering inpatient treatment is 30 years, but opioid and cocaine clients are on average older (31) than those in treatment for non-cocaine stimulants (28) and cannabis (26).
Most inpatient clients are men, with an overall male to female ratio of 3.6:1.
The ratio is lower among primary users of non-cocaine stimulants (2.2:1) and higher among users of cocaine (5.1:1) and cannabis (8:1).
Existing guidelines cover, in particular, pharmacological drug treatment.
National guidelines for substitution treatment are reported by 18 countries, and 11 countries report guidelines for detoxification.
However, about one third of these countries do not report adherence to the guidelines as a condition for operating or receiving funding for a treatment facility.
The main providers of inpatient treatment are nongovernmental organisations (12 countries) and public institutions (11 countries).
Private institutions play this role in Denmark and Luxembourg, while they are the second most important providers in 10 countries.
National experts estimate that inpatient psychosocial treatment is available to the majority of those seeking it in 12 countries and to almost all who seek it in a further nine countries.
However, in six countries (Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Romania), this treatment modality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it (see Figure 1C).
National guidelines for psychosocial treatment and social reintegration are less common.
The scarcity of national guidelines is probably due to the limited evidence available, and this points to the need for more multisite randomised controlled trials in these fields.
Detoxification is generally a prerequisite to initiate long-term, abstinence-based residential treatment.
It is commonly, but not exclusively, an inpatient intervention provided in hospitals, specialist treatment centres or residential facilities with medical or psychiatric wards.
Continued staff training is important in ensuring the delivery of high quality services. Training courses designed specifically for addiction treatment staff and some form of continued training related to drug treatment for medical doctors are common in the European Union.
Most countries make similar training opportunities available to other professionals including nurses, social workers and psychologists.
Regular outcome evaluations for all types of drug treatment are reported by few countries.
Five Member States evaluate substitution and detoxification treatment, and only Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom evaluate the outcome of psychosocial treatment interventions on a regular basis.
Single or irregular treatment outcome evaluations are also reported by some countries.
Public institutions are the main providers of detoxification in 21 countries.
Nongovernmental organisations are the largest providers in Belgium (Flanders) and the Netherlands, while the private sector is predominant in Luxembourg and Bulgaria.
National experts estimate that detoxification is available to a majority of those who seek it in nine countries, and to almost all in a further 10.
In eight countries (Estonia, Ireland, Greece, France, Latvia, Romania, Slovenia, Norway), detoxification is estimated to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it (see Figure 1D).
Quality assurance
Among the main interventions in this field are opioid substitution treatment and needle and syringe exchange programmes,
Health planners and policymakers in Europe increasingly look for mechanisms to ensure high quality in drug treatment.
They also tend to give priority to ‘evidencebased’ interventions when considering the provision of treatment and the allocation of funds.
Best practice portal: new module on treatment
Following the introduction of the modules on universal and selective prevention in 2008, the EMCDDA has launched a new module dedicated to drug treatment on its ‘Best practice portal’.
It includes a synthesis of findings about the efficacy of pharmacological and psychosocial treatment for opioid, stimulant and cannabis disorders, based on the latest reviews.
The treatment module presents the findings of studies that compare the efficacy of different interventions.
Efficacy is ideally determined by carrying out controlled trials or randomised controlled trials where interventions are compared against specific outcome measures. Most of the evidence base in this area comes from studies conducted in the United States.
Studies in Europe are now becoming more common, and include some ground-breaking work on new agents for opioid substitution treatment.
Responsibility for quality assurance lies with national institutions in 14 countries, while in countries with a federal system, agencies at sub-national level can be in charge.
Guidance can be underpinned by research findings on cost-effectiveness, as is the case in the United Kingdom’s guidance on needle and syringe programmes (NICE, 2009).
Client involvement and feedback by staff is also sought to develop and improve service quality.
Mechanisms to disseminate best practice and new research findings to professionals include national knowledge platforms, such as ‘resultaten scoren’ (scoring results) in the Netherlands and international awareness events, for example on hepatitis C (21).
A data collection protocol for specialist lowthreshold harm reduction agencies was also produced by the European Network of Social Inclusion and Health in cooperation with the EMCDDA (Hedrich et al., 2008a), as part of EU-funded projects to develop and implement European health indicators.
The new module also includes: links to other information sources, evaluated interventions, a glossary and a brief synopsis of the gaps in the current evidence base.
The portal will be expanded to include additional topics in the future.
EMCDDA Best practice portal: http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/best-practice which target overdose deaths and the spread of infectious diseases.
These measures are reported to be available in all countries except Turkey.
Social reintegration is recognised as an essential component of comprehensive drug strategies.
It can be implemented at any stage of drug use and in different settings, and includes capacity building, improvement of social skills, measures to facilitate and promote employment and to obtain or improve housing. In practice, reintegration programmes may offer vocational counselling, work placements and housing support.
Prison-based interventions, which have an impact on relapse and re-offending, may link inmates to communitybased housing and social support services in preparation for their release (Directorate-General on Health and Consumers, 2008a).
Homelessness, together with living in unstable accommodation, is one of the most serious forms of social exclusion facing drug users, affecting about 10 % of those entering treatment in 2007 (22).
This figure is likely to be much higher for certain groups of drug users.
Most countries provide a range of health care and social services, including individual risk assessment and advice, safer use training, infectious diseases testing and counselling, vaccination and treatment of viral hepatitis.
These services are often provided at lowthreshold agencies.
The focus of harm reduction responses has expanded beyond the HIV/AIDS epidemic into the broader perspective of catering for the health and social needs of problem drug users, especially those who are socially excluded.
All Member States report the availability of housing schemes that can accommodate drug users.
Information on the extent to which the housing needs of drug users are met, however, is scarce.
A process of professionalisation can also be observed in recent years, and more scrutiny is applied to assure high quality standards.
For example, in 2006/07, harm reduction services in England were inspected in order to identify areas for improvement.
Quality may also be assured through stipulating adherence to specific standards in funding contracts, as reported by the Czech Republic and Estonia.
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
The nature and intensity of drug law enforcement efforts may vary, depending on national legislation and its application, as well as on the resources and priorities of the institutions involved, which include general law enforcement agencies and specialised units (‘drug squads’).
Finland, Sweden, United Kingdom). These temporary housing schemes usually consist of bed and breakfast accommodation or small furnished flats with shortterm tenancies, and are often provided at discharge from residential treatment to enable individuals to live independently.
In Ireland, for example, users are responsible for paying the rent and some domestic services, while support workers help them with their tenancy and to gain access to education, training or employment.
Unlike some other areas of law enforcement, where police officers typically respond to breaches of the law, often reported by members of the public, the bulk of drug law enforcement work may be defined as proactive, as it is performed mostly on the initiative of drug law enforcement institutions.
This is because many drug offences can be viewed as a ‘consensual crime’, where consenting individuals secretly participate in an unlawful activity of which the police will remain unaware unless discovered by chance (e.g. during a foot patrol) or by active detection.
As 45 % of users entering treatment have at best completed primary school, and about 40 % of users entering treatment are unemployed (23), helping drug users to find employment and vocational training are key elements of social reintegration.
In Hungary, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia, the reintegration of drug users into the labour market has benefited from projects funded under the EU initiative against discrimination in the labour market (EQUAL).
Most of these projects help stabilised drug treatment clients to find work placements in line with their abilities.
The value of this approach is supported by the results of a Scottish study, which found that recovering drug users who received employment-related support were three times more likely to have found paid employment (McIntosh et al., 2008).
As a consequence, drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering, processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means, including computerised databases and dedicated communication networks.
Controlled deliveries of drugs and targeted operations aimed at disrupting or eliminating drug selling points are some of the operational tactics used by law enforcement agencies in Europe.
Performing checks and searches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations, such as ports, airports and land borders, is a more generic tactic, which also includes other aims, such as immigration control.
The enforcement of the legislation on drugs involves various authorities located in different departments of government (e.g. police, justice, health).
In practice, the term ‘drug law enforcement’ is commonly associated with the set of activities implemented by police and police-like institutions (e.g. customs) to enforce the laws relating to drug use and the drug market.
Among the areas covered are drug use and possession, trafficking and production, as well as diversion of chemicals and money laundering.
Law enforcement institutions, especially customs, are also tasked in many countries with enforcing laws on controlled chemicals.
This involves processing importation and exportation requests as well as identifying and investigating suspicious transactions.
Dismantling clandestine illicit drug laboratories may be another task of law enforcement forces in countries where synthetic drugs are manufactured.
Initial reports on drug law offences, mainly from the police, are the only data on drugrelated crime routinely
Drug law enforcement is a central component of Europe’s response to drugs, and it receives a large, possibly the largest, share of the resources devoted to the drug problem.
A recent attempt to compare the allocation of drugrelated public expenditure in Europe suggested that, on average, government spending on drugrelated ‘public order and safety’ (police forces, courts and prisons) could be nearly three times the amount spent to deal with the health problems associated with drug use.
The reports usually refer to
23) See Tables TDI-12 and TDI-13 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.24) For a definition of drug supply reduction, see the box on p.
The EMCDDA published in 2009 a new ‘Selected issue’ on sentencing statistics, which examines the outcomes of drug-law offences in European countries. The report looks at available national statistics from police, prosecutors and courts, and examines them according to the type of offence (possession, trafficking) and the type of outcome (fine, custody, treatment).
Furthermore, national information systems may differ, especially in relation to recording and reporting practices. For these reasons, it is difficult to make valid comparisons between countries, and it is more appropriate to compare trends rather than absolute numbers.
Offences related to the supply of drugs also increased during the period 2002–07, but at a much lower pace, with an increase of about 14 % in the European Union. Over this period, eight countries report an overall decline in supply-related offences, and eight report an increase (30).
On the basis of data provided by 21 Member States, representing 85 % of the population aged 15–64 in the European Union, the number of reported drug law offences increased by an estimated 29 % between 2002 and 2007.
The data reveal upward trends in all reporting countries except Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Luxembourg, Hungary and Slovenia, all of which were stable or observed an overall decline over the period (26
Use- and supply-related offences
Cannabis continues to be the illicit drug most often mentioned in reported drug law offences in Europe (31). In the majority of European countries, offences involving cannabis accounted for between 55 % and 85 % of reported drug law offences in 2007.
Offences related to other drugs exceeded those related to cannabis in only two countries: Lithuania, heroin (26 %); and the Czech Republic, methamphetamine (59 %). In Latvia, drug law offences are evenly distributed between cannabis, heroin and ecstasy.
There has been no major shift in the balance between drug law offences related to use and those related to supply (dealing, trafficking, production) compared to previous years.
In most European countries, offences related to drug use or possession for use continue to comprise the majority of drug law offences, accounting for as much as 91 % (Spain) of the total in 2007 (27).
Offences related to supply are, however, predominant in the Czech Republic (87 %) and the Netherlands (69 %) (Figure 2).
In the Czech Republic, possession of small quantities of drugs without intent to supply is punishable by a warning or a fine, while in the Netherlands drug-use related offences are generally not prosecuted (28).
In the 5-year period 2002–07, the number of drug law offences involving cannabis increased or remained stable in most reporting countries, resulting in an estimated increase of 23 % in the European Union.
Downward trends are reported by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia (32).
Between 2002 and 2007, the number of drug law offences related to use increased in most reporting countries, with only Bulgaria, Greece, the Netherlands and Slovenia reporting a decline across the period (29
Cocaine-related offences increased over the period 2002–07 in all reporting countries except Bulgaria and Germany. In the European Union, overall, offences related to cocaine increased by about 59 % over the same

Health and social responses in prison
The downward trend in heroin-related offences in the European Union noted in previous reports now appears to have ceased, and an increase of about 7 % has been observed for the period 2002–07.
However, national trends have been diverging, and the upward trend is mainly due to increases during the last 2 years in Belgium, Greece, Spain, France, Poland and Portugal, and a stabilisation in Germany and Austria (34).
On a given day, there are over 600 000 people in prison in the European Union (36), giving an average imprisonment rate of about 120 prisoners per 100 000 population.
National prison population rates range from 65 to 320 prisoners per 100 000 population with most Member States from central and eastern Europe reporting higher than average rates.
Nevertheless, the national figures, and the EU-average, remain considerably below the rates reported from Russia (629) and the
The number of offences related to amphetamines reported in the European Union continues to show an upward trend, with an estimated increase of 59 % between 2002 and 2007.
Ecstasy-related offences, in contrast, have decreased

There is still a lack of standardisation of definitions, research questions and methodologies used in studies on prison drug use (Vandam, 2009; Directorate-General for Health and Consumers, 2008a), though existing studies show that drug use continues to be more prevalent among prisoners than among the general population.
Services offered to prisoners in European countries include: information on drugs and health; screening for infectious diseases and vaccination; treatment for drug dependence, including detoxification, substitution treatment and drug-free approaches; preparation for release.
Studies carried out since 2002 show that between 1 % and 50 % of inmates report having used drugs within prison, and that up to 27 % report regular use while incarcerated (39). A study of 1 457 prisoners, from six German prisons, found that 22 % had injected drugs in prison, while studies in four other countries reported rates of 10 % or more (40).
Injecting drug users in custody appear to share their equipment more often compared to users not in prison.
This raises issues around the potential spread of infectious diseases among the prison population.
Prison health in Europe
The continuation of substitution treatment when imprisoned is approved in official regulations of 26 countries, but not used in five of them, while initiation of this type of treatment in prison is approved in 21 countries.
According to expert ratings, however, there are differences in the provision of this intervention.
Prisoners are entitled to the same level of medical care as persons living in the community, and prison health services should be able to provide treatment for problems related to drug use in conditions comparable to those offered outside prison (CPT, 2006; WHO, 2007).

provision of this type of treatment in prison (42).
Other obstacles to receiving substitution treatment in prison reported by Member States include: the lack of a regulatory framework for its initiation (Finland), and the requirement to pay for the treatment (French-speaking community in Belgium).
The provision of substitution treatment is also often dependent on local conditions, and sometimes relies on the initiative of the individual prison doctor.
The level of provision of measures to prevent overdoses is similar. While pre-release counselling on overdose risk is available in 18 countries, it is estimated that it has been provided to more than a few prisoners over the past 12 months only in eight countries.
Information materials on drugrelated deaths and emergencies, elaborated specifically for the prison environment, are available in only seven countries (43).
Expert ratings of the availability and level of provision of other prevention and harm reduction measures in prison are available for 26 EU countries, Norway and Turkey.
Individual counselling on infectious diseases and assessment of drugrelated risk behaviour is reported to exist in prisons in 26 countries.
Hepatitis C testing upon prison entry is available in 22 countries, but not in Hungary, Poland and Turkey; however, in Hungary, more than 14 % of all prisoners were screened for HCV in the first 9 months of an ongoing campaign that began in 2007.
Other interventions include targeted prison hepatitis B
The provision of needle and syringe exchange in prison settings is reported by Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, Portugal and Romania, and it is planned in the United Kingdom (Scotland).
Resistance from prison staff and lack of confidentiality have been reported as obstacles to the successful implementation of some needle and syringe exchange programmes in prison.

Introduction
Supply and availability
Cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world.
It is currently estimated that cannabis is cultivated in 172 countries and territories (UNODC, 2009) (44).
These facts taken together mean that it is difficult to produce accurate estimates of the worldwide production of cannabis.
The UNODC (2009) estimates global production of herbal cannabis in 2008 at between 13 300 tonnes and 66 100 tonnes.
Cannabis cultivation in Europe is widespread and possibly increasing (Korf, 2008).
In 2007, 19 European countries mentioned domestic cannabis cultivation, though the scale of the phenomenon seems to vary considerably.
Herbal cannabis in Europe is also imported, mostly from Africa (e.g. Nigeria, Morocco, Ghana, South Africa)
The use of cannabis in Europe has evolved considerably over the last decade, as has the debate on how to respond appropriately to the widespread use of this drug.
In the early and mid-1990s, a few countries stood out as having a high prevalence, whereas the European norm was levels of use which, by today’s standards, were low.
In most countries, cannabis use increased during the 1990s and early 2000s, and this has resulted today in a less varied European picture, even if important differences between countries still exist.
Moreover, the last few years have seen a growing understanding of the public health implications of the long-term and widespread use of this drug, and rising reported levels of treatment demand for cannabis related problems.
Europe may now be moving into a new phase, as data from general population and school surveys point to a stabilising or even decreasing situation.
Levels of use remain high by historical standards, however; and what constitutes an effective response to cannabis use remains a key question in the European debate on drugs.

) For information on the sources of data for drug supply and availability, see p. 39.
Chapter 3: Cannabis and less often from south-west Asia (Pakistan) and the Americas (Jamaica) (INCB, 2009a).
Seizures of cannabis plants have increased steadily since 2002, reaching an estimated 15 000 cases in 2007. Countries report the quantity seized either as the number of plants or as an estimate of the weight.
The number of plants seized was 2.4 million, a figure that has been relatively stable over the past 2 years, up from about 1.5 million in 2002.
The weight of plants seized has increased markedly over the period and reached 27 tonnes in 2007, of which 25 tonnes were reported by Spain.
Potency and price
Global production of cannabis resin in 2008 is estimated at between 2 200 tonnes and 9 900 tonnes (UNODC, 2009), with Morocco continuing to be the main producer.
The area under cannabis resin production is reported to have declined from 134 000 hectares to 76 400 hectares between 2003 and 2005 (UNODC and Government of Morocco, 2007).
Resin production is also reported in other countries, including Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNODC, 2009).
Cannabis resin produced in Morocco is typically smuggled into Europe via the Iberian Peninsula and the Netherlands, being then further distributed to other European countries.
North America continued to account for the bulk of herbal cannabis seized (66 %), while quantities of resin seized remained concentrated in western and central Europe (66 %) (UNODC, 2009).
Systematic and routine information to describe illicit drug markets and trafficking is still limited.
Production estimates of heroin, cocaine and cannabis are obtained from cultivation estimates based on fieldwork (sampling on the ground) and aerial or satellite surveys. These estimates have some important limitations, linked for instance with variations in yield figures or with the difficulty of monitoring crops such as cannabis, which may be grown indoors or are not restricted to certain geographical areas.
The amount of herbal cannabis seized halved during the first 2 years of this period thereafter increasing, though remaining well below the 130 tonnes seized in 2002.
The highest number of seizures of herbal cannabis was reported by the United Kingdom, accounting for approximately half of the total in 2005 and 2006.
Turkey (25.5 tonnes) and Belgium (12.8 tonnes) reported record seizures in 2007.
Drug seizures are often considered as an indirect indicator of the supply, trafficking routes and availability of drugs.
They are a more direct indicator of drug law enforcement activities (e.g. priorities, resources, strategies), while also reflecting both reporting practices and the vulnerability of traffickers.
Data on purity or potency and retail prices of illicit drugs may also be analysed in order to understand retail drug markets.
However, the availability of this type of data may be limited and there may be questions of reliability and comparability. Intelligence information from law enforcement agencies may help complete the picture.
Seizures of cannabis resin in Europe exceed herbal cannabis seizures, both in number and amount seized (
Information on drug precursors is obtained from the European Commission, which collects data on seizures of these substances in the EU, and the INCB, which is involved in international initiatives to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs.
Between 2002 and 2007, the number of cannabis resin seizures increased, though the amount seized fluctuated over the same period.
) The data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR-1 to SZR-6 in the 2009 statistical bulletin. )
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe include those using the drug more regularly, though not necessarily in an intensive way.
It is estimated that about 12 million Europeans used the drug in the last month, on average about 3.6 % of all 15- to 64-year-olds.
Population surveys: an important tool for understanding drug use patterns and trends in Europe
Drug use in the general or school population can be measured through representative surveys, which provide estimates of the proportion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time.
Surveys also provide useful contextual information on patterns of use, sociodemographic characteristics of users and perceptions of risks and availability.
The extent to which the samples analysed reflect the overall market is unclear and, for this reason, data on potency should be interpreted with caution.
In 2007, the reported national mean THC content of cannabis resin ranged from 2.9 % to 13.3 %.
The mean potency of herbal cannabis, excluding home-grown sinsemilla (‘nederwiet’) in the Netherlands, ranged from 1.2 % to 10.2 %.
Over the period 2002–07, the reported mean potency of resin and herbal cannabis remained stable or decreased in most of the 16 European countries for which this analysis could be made.
However, upward trends in the mean THC content of cannabis resin were registered in Portugal and Luxembourg.
Increases in the potency of herbal cannabis were observed in five other countries.
Information on the potency of locally produced herbal cannabis over a number of years is available only for the Netherlands, where a recent decline in the mean potency of nederwiet was observed, from a peak of 20.3 % in 2004 to 16.0 % in 2006, remaining at that level in 2007 (47).
The EMCDDA, in close collaboration with national experts, has developed a set of core items for use in adult surveys (the ‘European Model Questionnaire’, EMQ).
However, there are still differences in the methodology used and year of data collection, and this means that small differences, in particular between countries, should be interpreted with caution.
Surveys are expensive to conduct and few European countries collect information each year, although many collect it at intervals of two to four years.
In this report, data is presented based on the most recent survey available in each country, which in most cases is between 2004 and 2007.
The mean retail price of cannabis resin, in 2007, ranged from EUR 3 to EUR 11 per gram in the 18 countries providing information, with half of them reporting values between EUR 5 and EUR 9.
The mean retail price of herbal cannabis ranged between EUR 1 and EUR 12 per gram in the 17 countries supplying information, with about half of them reporting prices of between EUR 4 and EUR 9.
For the 11 countries with data covering the period 2002–07, the mean retail price of cannabis resin, corrected for inflation, declined. Over the same period, the data available for herbal cannabis point to a more stable situation.
Of the three standard time frames used for reporting survey data, lifetime prevalence (use of a drug at any point in one’s life) is the broadest.
This measure does not reflect the current drug use situation among adults, but can be helpful to understand patterns of use and incidence.
For adults, the EMCDDA’s standard age ranges are 15–64 years (all adults) and 15–34 years (young adults), and the focus is on the last year and last month time frames (use during the last 12 months or last 30 days before the survey) (1).
For school students, lifetime and last year prevalence are similar, as illicit drug use before age 15 is rare.
The European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs (ESPAD) uses standardised methods and instruments to measure drug and alcohol use among representative samples of 15- to 16-year-old school students.
Surveys have been conducted in 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007.
In 2007, data were collected in 35 countries, including 25 EU Member States, Norway and Croatia (2).
Considerable differences exist between countries, with national prevalence figures varying from 1.5 % to 38.6 %.
For most of the countries, the prevalence estimates are in the range 10–30 %.
(1) For more information, see http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/methods/gps-overview
Many countries report comparatively high prevalence levels of last year and last month use of cannabis.
It is estimated that around 22.5 million Europeans have used cannabis in the last year, or on average 6.8 % of all 15- to 64-year-olds.

European prevalence estimates are based on weighted averages from the most recent national surveys conducted from 2001 to 2008 (mainly 2004–08), therefore they cannot be attached to a single year.
The average prevalence for Europe was computed by a weighted average according to the population of the relevant age group in each country.
In countries for which no information was available, the average EU prevalence was imputed.
Populations used as basis: 15–64 (334 million), 15–34 (133 million) and 15–24 (63 million).
The data summarised here are available under ‘General population surveys’ in the 2009 statistical bulletin.
Cannabis use among young adults olds. This is the case in almost all European countries, with the exception of Portugal (48
Cannabis use is largely concentrated among young people (15–34 years), with the highest levels of last year use generally being reported among the 15- to 24-year-
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe among young adults (15–34 years, recalculated by the EMCDDA) and a last year prevalence of 21 %.
For the same age group, lifetime prevalence of cannabis use was 58 % and last year prevalence 28 % in Canada (2004), while in Australia (2007) the figures were 47 % and 16 %.
All these figures are above the corresponding European averages, which are respectively 31.1 % and 12.5 %.
Still higher proportions of Europeans in the 15–24 age group are estimated to have used cannabis in the last year (15.9 %) or last month (8.3 %).
National prevalence estimates of cannabis use vary widely between countries in all measures of prevalence, with countries at the upper end of the scale reporting values up to 10 times those of the lowest-prevalence countries.
Among school students, only Spain and the Czech Republic report levels of lifetime prevalence of cannabis use that are comparable to those reported in the United States and Australia.
Cannabis use is generally higher among males than among females (see EMCDDA, 2006a), though marked differences between countries are observed.
For example, the ratio of males to females among those reporting use of cannabis in the last year ranged from 6.4:1 in Portugal to 1.4:1 in Austria.
Cannabis use among school students
The ESPAD survey (49) provides comparable data on alcohol and drug use among 15- to 16-year-old school students in Europe (Hibell et al., 2009).
In 2007, the survey was conducted in 25 EU Member States as well as Norway and Croatia.
Some countries (e.g. Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom) conduct their own national school surveys which provide data, including on cannabis use, that is comparable with the ESPAD and the HBSC (Health-Behaviour in School-aged Children) surveys.
National survey data reported to the EMCDDA show that in almost all EU countries cannabis use increased markedly during the 1990s, in particular among young people (Figure 3) and school students.
By the turn of the century, in most European countries a sizable proportion of the young population had used or were using the drug, as illustrated by the fact that between 1998 and 2003, lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among the 15- to 34-year-olds increased to levels of around 30 % in seven countries and exceeded 40 % in an additional two.
Corresponding levels of last year prevalence among this age group were as high as 15–20 % in seven countries and last month prevalence reached 8–15 % in six countries.
The 2007 ESPAD data revealed that the highest lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among 15- to 16-year-old school students is in the Czech Republic (45 %) (50), while Estonia, France, the Netherlands, Slovakia and the United Kingdom report prevalence levels ranging from 26 % to 32 %.
Lifetime prevalence levels of cannabis use of between 13 % and 25 % are reported by 15 countries.
The highest last month prevalence of cannabis use among 15- to 16-year-olds in Europe is reported by Spain (20 %)
European figures can be compared with those from other parts of the world.
For instance, in the United States, the National survey on drug use and health (Samhsa, 2007) estimated a lifetime prevalence of cannabis use of 49 %
The trend in cannabis use in the United Kingdom is particularly interesting.
In the early and mid-1990s, this country stood out in the European picture as the one reporting the highest prevalence estimates.
This picture has progressively changed, as levels of use rose in other countries.
Moreover, cannabis use in the United Kingdom has been steadily declining since around 2003, particularly among the 16–24 age group (52), suggesting a generational shift.
A downward or stabilising trend can now be seen elsewhere, in both school and some general population survey data.
Of the 11 countries for which it is possible to analyse the trend in last year prevalence among young adults between 2002 and 2007, four report decreases of at least 15 % of the initial value, and in a further four the situation appears stable (53).
In three countries, prevalence levels have increased by at least 15 %, although other data put this upward trend into question.

In this region, six countries report a stable situation and two report an increase of more than three percentage points (56).
As with adults, increases in cannabis use among school students occurred in a number of European countries between 1995 and 2003, but in general have come to a halt or decreased more recently.
Only two of the countries monitored by the EMCDDA that participated in ESPAD school surveys in 2007 (Lithuania, Slovakia) report an increase of more than three percentage points in lifetime cannabis use since 2003, while nine countries report an equivalent decrease during this period (54).
Available data point to a variety of patterns of cannabis use.
Figure 4: Different patterns in trends in lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among 15- to 16-year-old school students
Studies show that the development of cannabis dependence is less abrupt than with other drugs (e.g. cocaine) and that among those who used the drug at least once in their life, the proportion ever developing dependence might not exceed 10 % (Wagner and Anthony, 2002).
In general population survey data from the United States, dependence was detected in some 20–30 % of daily users (61).
Other studies suggested that cannabis dependence can be relatively stable over time (Swift et al., 2000). Nevertheless, probably over half of
The European averages are an estimation based on a weighted average (for the population) for countries with information, and imputed for countries without information.
The figures obtained are 1.2 % for all adults (15–64 years) and 2.3 % for young adults (15–34 years).
See Table
Chapter 3: Cannabis dependent cannabis users who stop using the drug are able to do so without treatment (Cunningham, 2000; Ellingstad et al., 2006).
Patterns among school students
The 2007 ESPAD surveys also show that lifetime cannabis use is correlated with perceptions of lower risk and higher availability of the drug (62
Compared with the general population of students, cannabis users are more likely to use alcohol, tobacco and other illicit drugs (63
There is evidence that cannabis dependence can be measured in the general population as reliably as in samples of treated users, including the measurement of withdrawal symptoms (Mennes et al., 2009).
The EMCDDA is therefore developing, in collaboration with several countries, methods for monitoring the more intensive and significant long-term forms of cannabis use.
In 2007, cannabis was the primary drug in about 20 % of all treatment entries (73 000 clients), making it the second most reported drug after heroin.
However, country differences are considerable, with Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovenia reporting less than 5 % of their clients as primary cannabis users and Denmark, France, Hungary, the Netherlands and Turkey reporting more than 30 %.
These differences may be explained by the prevalence of cannabis use, drug treatment needs, treatment provision and organisation or referrals practices.
In the two countries with the largest proportions of cannabis clients, counselling centres target young drug users in France, and cannabis offenders in Hungary are offered drug treatment as an alternative to punishment. The criminal justice system plays a substantial role in treatment referral in both of these countries but, overall, Member States report that most cannabis users entering treatment in Europe do it on their own initiative.
Different methodologies to estimate, within the general population surveys, the prevalence of intensive and problematic forms of drug use, mainly cannabis use, have been tested in recent years.
German experts have reviewed the literature and the work currently done in this field, and have identified four short cannabis scales that have been tested in samples of the general population in Europe.
These are the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), Problematic Use of Marijuana (PUM), the Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) and the Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test (CUDIT) (Piontek et al., 2008).
Clients entering outpatient centres because of cannabis use often also report the use of other drugs.
Based on a data collection in 14 countries, 85 % of them take another drug, mostly alcohol (65 %) or cocaine (13 %), and some report use of both alcohol and cocaine (12 %) (65).
Trends in new demands for drug treatment
2002 and 2007 (66).
Some difficulties remain, however, in this field because of the lack of consensus regarding which construct (e.g. dependence, abuse, harmful use, use related problems) or set of constructs should be measured to assess problematic forms of cannabis use.
There are also estimation difficulties, as measures of a phenomenon with a low prevalence may produce many ‘false positive’ cases and, therefore, an overestimation of problematic cannabis use in the overall population.
Additional validation studies, which are currently in progress or planned, might help overcome these difficulties.

This might be linked with recent trends in cannabis use, but can also reflect changes in reporting practices, service capacity saturation or use of other services (e.g. primary health care, mental health care).
Cannabis users entering outpatient treatment in Europe are mainly young males, with a male to female ratio of
5.5:1 and a mean age of 25 years (67
Among drug users entering outpatient treatment for the first time, primary cannabis use is reported by 67 % of those aged 15–19 years (68
) and by 78 % of those younger than 15 years.
may also reduce the risk of young people mixing with more problematic and older drug users.
In 2008, the EMCDDA collected information on the availability of such programmes in Europe.
National experts reported that they existed in 13 out of 25 reporting countries (Figure 5).
Availability of services varied between countries.
It was estimated that: nearly all those seeking specific treatment would obtain it in France, Greece and Slovenia; more than half of them in Germany and the United Kingdom; and only a minority in the remaining eight countries.
Among the 12 countries reporting that specific programmes for cannabis users do not exist, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Romania and Turkey are planning to set them up during the next 3 years.
Figure 5: Availability of specific treatment programmes for cannabis users and last month prevalence of cannabis use (%) among 15- to 24-year-olds
Treatment availability
Overall, 24 % of primary cannabis users entering outpatient treatment are occasional users, probably often referred by the criminal justice system; 12 % use cannabis weekly or less often; about 18 % use it 2–6 times a week; and 47 % are daily users, the most problematic group.
Considerable differences are observed between countries.
In Hungary, Romania and Croatia, the majority of cannabis clients are occasional users, while in Belgium, Denmark, Spain, France, Malta and the Netherlands the majority are daily users (69).
A French study, among clients of specialised counselling centres, found that 63 % of daily cannabis users were dependent (Obradovic, 2008).
Not available No information
Many cannabis clients are still students and are living in stable accommodation (EMCDDA, 2008a).

Treatment programmes for cannabis users in Europe
In Greece, OKANA’s Units for Adolescents provide an early intervention programme for experimental or occasional cannabis users, while more structured treatment is provided to intensive and problem users.
The treatment is mostly based on systemic and family therapy.
Internet-based treatment
Internet-based drug treatment has existed in the European Union since 2004 and its provision is still limited.
A recent study provides insights into the current state of development of this type of intervention in the European Union (EMCDDA, 2009a).
Internet-based treatment can be defined as ‘specifically elaborated or adapted, structured and scheduled drug treatment interventions, offered in and communicated over the World Wide Web’.
Interventions for treating cannabis use disorders have been identified in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, while others designed for cocaine and ‘club drug’ (e.g. ecstasy) users were also found in the Netherlands.
programme ‘Quit the shit’ (70) has been transferred to 12 drug counselling facilities in seven federal states.
FRED (see Chapter 2) offers motivational interviewing-based counselling for those referred by the criminal justice system.
Candis, a treatment programme for patients with cannabis-related disorders, based on motivational enhancement, cognitive behavioural therapy and psychosocial problem solving is currently implemented in Dresden.
An evaluation of this programme showed positive results and findings from an ongoing follow-up study in 10 further centres will determine whether it will be implemented elsewhere.
Internet-based treatment is developed by organisations in the treatment or prevention fields and aims at helping users to assess their substance use and to assist them in their attempts to change this behaviour.
Interventions provide information and knowledge tests or games about drugs and drug dependence, or drug consumption self-tests.
Common to all of them is the availability of a structured treatment intervention, which is either a pre-tailored self-help programme without contact to counsellors, or a structured programme with scheduled contacts.
The latter can be implemented via one-to-one chats or message boards.
Contact with other users via a forum is also sometimes provided, thereby creating virtual self-help groups.
Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland are also collaborating in an international study named Incant, which investigates the effectiveness of a comprehensive family-based treatment for problematic cannabis use.
The scientific literature suggests that a number of psychotherapies, such as motivational and cognitivebehavioural therapies, are effective for cannabis treatment but that none has been found to be more effective than the others (Nordstrom and Levin, 2007).
Some problem cannabis users may also benefit from brief interventions, delivered for example by social services for juveniles, general practitioners and schools.
There is still a lack of available evidence on the efficacy of these types of interventions, but findings from the first randomised controlled trials point towards a potential benefit.
Preliminary evaluation results of the ‘Quit the shit’ intervention for cannabis users in Germany has shown that 32 % of participants reported abstinence after completing the programme and that first-time treatment seekers, in particular, were reached.
At the same time, they might also be confronted with severe problems, such as drug dependence or other mental health problems, which lie beyond the capacities of Internet-based treatment.
A recent randomised controlled trial involving 326 young intensive cannabis users found, at either 3 or 6 months
(MDMA), but other analogues are also sometimes found in ecstasy tablets (MDA, MDEA).
Ecstasy use was virtually unknown in Europe before the late 1980s, but increased rapidly during the 1990s.
The drug’s popularity has historically been linked with the dance-music scene and, in general, synthetic drug use is associated with particular cultural subgroups or social settings.
Amphetamines (a generic term that includes both amphetamine and methamphetamine) and ecstasy are among the most commonly used illicit drugs in Europe.
In terms of the absolute numbers, cocaine use may be higher, but its geographic concentration means that in many countries, after cannabis, the second most commonly used illicit substance is either ecstasy or amphetamines.
Moreover, in some countries, use of amphetamines constitutes an important part of the drug problem, accounting for a substantial proportion of those in need of treatment.
The most widely known synthetic hallucinogenic drug in Europe is lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), consumption of which has been low and somewhat stable for a considerable time.
In recent years, there appears to have been a growing interest among young people in naturally occurring hallucinogens such as those found in hallucinogenic mushrooms.

Other terms, such as ‘essential chemicals’, may also be applied to these substances.
Global amphetamine production remains concentrated in Europe, which accounted for 81 % of all amphetamine laboratories reported in 2007 (UNODC, 2009), but it is also found in other parts of the world, notably North
America (72). Global seizures of amphetamines in 2007
‘Captagon’ tablets (73) produced in southeast Europe
Western and central Europe accounted for 36 % of global seizures, reflecting Europe’s role as both a major producer and consumer of this drug (CND, 2008; UNODC, 2009).
Article 12 was transposed into the initial European legislation adopted in 1990 to discourage diversion of these substances to illicit ends (EEC No 3677/90), and regulations adopted later in order to regulate their trade within the EU (EC No 273/2004), between the EU and non-EU countries (EC No 111/2005), and establish licensing procedures and monitoring rules (EC No 1277/2005).
Most amphetamine seized in Europe is produced, in order of importance, in the Netherlands, Poland and Belgium, and to a lesser extent in Estonia and Lithuania.
In 2007, 29 sites involved in the production, tableting or storage of amphetamines were discovered in the European Union and reported to Europol.
In 2007, an estimated 40 000 seizures amounting to 8.1
tonnes of amphetamine powder were made in Europe (Over the period 2002–07, the number of seizures has increased steadily while the amount of amphetamine intercepted has fluctuated, though on a generally upward
Category 1 of the EU regulations includes mostly substances that are indispensable for the manufacture of synthetic drugs, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine (for methamphetamine); 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone (PMK), isosafrole and safrole (for ecstasy); and 1-phenyl-2-propanone (P2P, BMK) (for amphetamine and methamphetamine).
Category 2 contains important reagents such as potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride, which are widely used to manufacture cocaine and heroin, respectively.
Category 3 lists more common reagents including hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid (for heroin and cocaine), and solvents such as acetone (for cocaine and MDMA) and toluene (for methamphetamine and MDMA).

74) This analysis is preliminary, as data for the United Kingdom are not yet available for 2007.75) The data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR-11 to SZR-18 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.
Between 2005 and 2007, both the number and the quantity of methamphetamine seized in Europe have been increasing, though both remain low in comparison to other drugs.
Nevertheless, mean purity of samples range from less than 10 % in Denmark, Germany, France and United Kingdom to greater than 30 % in the Netherlands, Poland and some Baltic and Nordic countries.
Over the past 5 years, the purity of amphetamine has been stable or falling in most of those 20 countries where sufficient data are available to allow analysis of trends.
Of the 11 countries where a comparison of data for 2007 and 2006 was possible, Spain, France and Austria reported increases in the retail price, while the rest reported stable or decreasing prices.
In 2007, 18.2 tonnes of methamphetamine was seized, continuing a stable trend since 2004. Most of the drug was seized in east and southeast Asia (56 %), followed by North America, with Europe contributing with only 2 % of seizures (UNODC, 2009).
Global ecstasy seizures in 2007 reached 7.9 tonnes, with increases reported in most regions.
West and central Europe accounted for 36 % of the global seizures, and southeast Europe for 2 % (UNODC, 2009).
Overall, more than 24 000 seizures, resulting in the interception of an estimated 13 million ecstasy tablets were reported in Europe in 2007.
The Netherlands reported the largest quantity seized, which at 8.4 million tablets represents a doubling of the quantity reported in 2006.
Only two other European countries reported seizures approaching this magnitude in 2007, with France and Germany both reporting about one million tablets seized.
The United Kingdom also reported seizing over 6 million tablets in 2006, but data for 2007 are not yet available.
Over the period 2002–07, the number of ecstasy seizures reported in Europe dropped sharply in 2003, but has since shown a slight increase year on year.
Over the same period, the quantity seized declined to a low in 2005, but has increased again, and appears to be approaching the 2002 level.
In 2007, almost 4 500 seizures of methamphetamine, amounting to approximately 340 kg of the drug, were reported in Europe.
Methamphetamine production in Europe: EMCDDA–Europol joint publication
In 2009, the EMCDDA and Europol launched a series of joint publications on the supply of drugs in Europe.
In Europe, most ecstasy tablets analysed in 2007 contained MDMA or another ecstasy-like substance (MDEA, MDA) as the only psychoactive substance present, with 17 countries reporting that this was the case in over 70 % of all tablets analysed.
Countries reporting lower proportions of ecstasy tablets with MDMA or its analogues included Bulgaria (47 %), Cyprus (44 %) and Austria (61 %).
In Luxembourg, most tablets (83 %) analysed contained no controlled substance, as was the case in Cyprus (53 %).
In Turkey, only 23 % of the tablets analysed were found to contain MDMA-like substances.
Reports on the supply of other synthetic drugs in Europe, including amphetamine and ecstasy, will be added to the series at a later stage.

The typical MDMA content of ecstasy tablets tested in 2007 was between 19 and 75 mg in the 11 countries providing data.
In addition, high-dose ecstasy tablets containing over 130 mg of MDMA were reported by

Relatively high levels of amphetamines or ecstasy use among the general population are reported by some EU Member States (Czech Republic, Estonia, United Kingdom).
In a few countries, the use, often by injection, of amphetamine or methamphetamine accounts for a substantial proportion of the overall number of problem drug users and those seeking help for drug problems.
In contrast to these chronic user populations, a more general association exists between the use of synthetic drugs, ecstasy in particular, and nightclubs and dance events; this results in significantly higher levels of use being reported among young people, and exceedingly high levels of use being found in some settings or specific sub-populations.
Finally, the overall consumption levels of hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and hallucinogenic mushrooms are generally low and have been largely stable in recent years.
Amphetamines some countries (Bulgaria, France, Netherlands, Slovakia, Norway).
There are no clear trends in the purity of ecstasy tablets.
Ecstasy is now considerably cheaper than it was in the 1990s, when it first became widely available.
While there are some reports of tablets being sold for less than EUR 2, most countries are reporting mean retail prices in the range of EUR 4–10 per tablet (Figure 6).
The data available for 2002–07 suggest that the retail price, adjusted for inflation, has continued to fall.
Hallucinogenic substances
Recent population surveys indicate that lifetime prevalence of the use of amphetamines (76) in Europe varies between countries, from nearly zero to 11.7 % of all adults (15–64 years).
On average, it is estimated that 3.5 % of all European adults have used amphetamines at least once.
Last year use of the drug is much lower, with a European average of 0.5 %. These estimates suggest that around 12 million Europeans have tried amphetamines, and about 2 million have used the drug during the last year (see Table 5 for a summary of the data).
LSD use and trafficking in Europe is still considered marginal.
The data available indicate a decline in quantities seized over the period 2002–07, while the number of seizures increased slightly between 2003 and 2007.
LSD retail prices (adjusted for inflation) have been slightly declining since 2003, and in 2007 the mean value ranged between EUR 5 and EUR 12 per unit for the majority of reporting countries.
Among young adults (15–34 years), lifetime prevalence of amphetamines use varies considerably between countries, from 0.1 % to 15.3 %, with a weighted European average of about 5 %.
Last year use of amphetamines in this age group ranges from 0.1 % to 3.1 %, with the majority of countries reporting prevalence estimates of between 0.5 % and 2.0 %.
It is estimated that, on average, 1.1 % of young Europeans have used amphetamines during the last year.
Among 15- to 16-year-old school students, lifetime prevalence of amphetamines use ranges from 1 % to 8 % in the 26 EU Member States, Norway and Croatia, surveyed in 2007, though prevalence levels of more than 5 % were reported only for Bulgaria, Latvia (both 6 %) and Austria (8 %) (77).
76) Survey data on ‘amphetamine use’ often do not distinguish between amphetamine and methamphetamine, though, as use of methamphetamine is uncommon in Europe, prevalence should typically reflect the use of amphetamine (sulphate or dexamphetamine).77) Data from all ESPAD countries and Spain.

Amphetamine users in treatment frequently report the use of other drugs, mainly cannabis and alcohol, and
In those countries where primary sometimes opioids ( amphetamine users make up a high proportion of those entering treatment, injection is the most frequently reported method of use (63–83 %).
Last year use of the drug varies across Europe, from 0.1 % to 3.5 %.
On all measures, and as with most other illicit drugs, reported use is far higher among males than among females.
In contrast to other parts of the world, where the use of methamphetamine has increased in recent years, levels of its use in Europe appear limited.
Historically, use of this drug in Europe has been concentrated in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
In 2007, the number of problem methamphetamine users in the Czech Republic was estimated to be approximately 20 400–21 400 (2.8 to 2.9 cases per 1 000 aged 15–64 years), twice the estimated number of problem opioid users; and in Slovakia, approximately 5 800–15 700 (1.5 to 4.0 cases per 1 000 aged 15–64 years), around 20 % fewer than the estimated number of problem opioid users.
Ecstasy consumption is much more common among young adults (15–34 years), where lifetime prevalence estimates ranged at national level from 0.6 % to 14.6 %, with between 0.2 % and 7.7 % of this age group reporting last year use of the drug. It is estimated that 7.5 million young Europeans (5.6 %) have ever tried ecstasy, with around 2 million (1.6 %) using it during the last year.
Estimates of prevalence are higher still if attention is restricted to a younger age band: among the 15–24 age group, lifetime prevalence ranges from 0.4 % to 18.7 %, though most countries report estimates in the 2.1–6.8 % range.
Last year use of ecstasy among this age group is estimated at between 1.0 % and 3.9 % in the majority of countries, though there is a considerable difference between the lowest national estimate at 0.3 % and the highest at 12 % (83).
In both of these countries, methamphetamine is reported as the primary drug by a large proportion of clients entering treatment: 61 % in the Czech Republic and 26 % in Slovakia.
Between 2002 and 2007, the demand for treatment related to methamphetamine use has been increasing in both countries (82).
Among 15- to 16-year-old school students, lifetime prevalence of ecstasy use ranges from 1 % to 5 % in most of the 28 countries surveyed in 2007.
Only four countries report higher prevalence levels: Bulgaria, Estonia, Slovakia (all 6 %) and Latvia (7 %).
Injection is the most commonly reported means of administration reported by methamphetamine users in treatment (82 % in Czech Republic, 41 % in Slovakia).
Use of other drugs is also often reported, mainly cannabis, alcohol and opioids.
In Slovakia, a sharp increase has been noted in the number of recipients of opioid substitution treatment reporting the use of methamphetamine.
The number of primary ecstasy users entering treatment in 2007 remained trivial.
In two thirds of the countries, ecstasy is mentioned by less than 1 % of drug clients; elsewhere, the proportion varies between 1 % and 5 %.
With an average age of 24 years, ecstasy clients are among the youngest groups entering drug treatment and often report the concomitant use of other substances, including cannabis, cocaine, alcohol and amphetamines (84).
Lifetime prevalence of LSD use among the adult population (15–64 years) ranges from almost zero to 5.2 %.

EMCDDA ‘Selected issue’ on polydrug use where lifetime prevalence estimates for young adults range from 0.3 % to 8.3 %, and last year prevalence estimates between 0.2 % and 2.8 %.
Most countries report lifetime prevalence estimates for the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms of between 1 % and 4 %, with Slovakia (5 %) and the Czech Republic (7 %) reporting higher levels (86).
Alongside the 2009 annual report, the EMCDDA is publishing a ‘Selected issue’ on polydrug use.
The document reviews the available definitions of this very common pattern of drug use and presents data which allow a better understanding of the prevalence and characteristics of polydrug use in different populations (school-aged children, adults, problem drug users).
Existing interventions that target this phenomenon in the prevention, treatment and harmreduction fields are also described. The report also includes a brief overview of the risks associated with some of the most common drug mixtures and a discussion on monitoring polydrug use in the future.
Trends in the use of amphetamines and ecstasy
This ‘Selected issue’ is available in print and on the Internet in English only (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/selected-issues/polydrug-use).

reports, are supported by the most recent data.
After general increases in the 1990s, population surveys now point to an overall stabilisation, or even moderate decrease, in the popularity of both drugs, although this pattern is not seen in all countries.
Cocaine could be replacing amphetamines and ecstasy in some countries and among some sectors of the drug-using population.
This hypothesis can be illustrated in the United Kingdom and, to some extent, in other countries (e.g. Denmark, Spain), where concurrent increases in cocaine consumption and decreases in the use of amphetamines have been observed (EMCDDA, 2008b).
Last year use of amphetamine among young adults (15–34) in the United Kingdom has declined substantially from 6.2 % in 1998 to 1.8 % in 2008.
In Denmark, amphetamine use increased from 0.5 % in 1994 to 3.1 % in 2000, with a similar figure in 2008 (87).
Among the other countries reporting repeated surveys over a similar time span (Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Netherlands, Slovakia, Finland), the trends are largely stable (Figure 7). During the 5-year period 2002–07, of the 11 countries with sufficient data on last year prevalence of amphetamine use among the 15–34 age group, four report a decrease of at least 15 % of the initial value, three report stabilisation and four report an increase.
ESPAD and other school surveys conducted in 2007 suggest, overall, little change in the levels of experimentation with amphetamine and ecstasy among students aged 15 to 16 years.
Considering differences of at least two percentage points between 2003 and 2007, lifetime prevalence of amphetamine use increased in nine countries.
By the same measure, ecstasy use increased in seven countries.
A decrease in lifetime prevalence of amphetamine use was observed only in Estonia, while Czech Republic, Portugal, Croatia reported a decrease in ecstasy use.
For ecstasy use among young adults (15–34), the picture is more mixed.
After general increases in use in some European countries in the late 1980s and early 1990s, leading to similar levels of ecstasy use in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s, last year prevalence of use has decreased to an estimated European average of 1.6 %.
Among countries with more recent surveys, prevalence remains higher in the United Kingdom compared to other countries (88). Over the 5-year period 2002–07, last year prevalence of ecstasy use among young adults decreased by at least 15 % of the

using amphetamines and ecstasy or other drugs such as ketamine and GHB.
Estimates of drug use in these settings are typically high, but are not generalisable to the wider population, and much of the drug use tends to occur on weekends and during holiday periods (EMCDDA, 2006b).
Treatment
Users of amphetamines generally receive treatment in outpatient drug services which, in countries with histories of significant levels of the use of amphetamines, can be specialised in treating this type of drug problem.
Treatment for the most problematic users of amphetamines may be provided in inpatient drug services or in psychiatric clinics or hospitals.
Prevalence data from studies conducted in recreational settings in 2007 are available from five countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria).
Lifetime prevalence estimates ranged from 15 % to 71 % for ecstasy use and from 17 % to 68 % for amphetamines.
Four of these studies also reported lifetime prevalence estimates for hallucinogenic mushrooms, ranging from 4 % to 64 %.
Frequent use of ecstasy or amphetamines can also be found in these settings but it is generally much lower.
An indication of the extent to which the use of these drugs may be concentrated among the young, club-going population can be gleaned from the 2007/08 British Crime Survey.
Among 16- to 24-year-olds, those who reported visiting a nightclub four or more times in the last month were more than three times as likely to have used ecstasy (8 %) in the last year than those not attending nightclubs (2.3 %) (Hoare and Flatley, 2008).
Specific treatment programmes for problem amphetamines users are reported in nine countries (Germany, Estonia, Spain, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, United Kingdom).
The availability of these programmes varies between countries.
Only three of these countries (Portugal, Slovenia, United Kingdom) report that specialised programmes are available to the majority of amphetamines users who actively seek treatment.
In the other six countries, national experts estimate that specialised amphetamines treatment is available to less than half of the users seeking it.
The content of these specific programmes for users of these drugs is often not well documented.
The health and safety of people who attend nightclubs and use drugs is a growing public health concern.
Guidelines, such as the ‘Safer dancing’ guidelines developed in the United Kingdom, have become an important tool in this field.
However, while 12 countries now report having developed such guidelines for nightlife venues, only the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom report that they are monitored and enforced.
Therapeutic options with robust evidence of effectiveness are generally lacking to guide the treatment of dependence on psychostimulants, such as amphetamines.
Promising results have been reported for recent investigations on pharmacological agents to manage abstinence or reduce the cravings associated with amphetamines dependence, which up to now have been lacking.
A Finnish study on the use of methylphenidate and aripiprazole reported positive initial results, with those who received methylphenidate producing fewer amphetamine-positive urine samples than those receiving aripiprazole or a placebo (Tiihonen et al., 2007).
Dexamphetamine has long been available for the treatment of highly problematic users of amphetamines in England and Wales, where it may be prescribed by any doctor. However, information on this practice in the United Kingdom is limited.
A survey of pharmacy services conducted over 10 years ago estimated that 900 to 1 000 clients were receiving this treatment (Strang and Sheridan, 1997). Most prescriptions were issued by doctors working in hospitals or clinics, and almost
Five countries report immediate availability of first aid in the majority of relevant nightclubs (Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, United Kingdom, Norway); the measure is available only in a minority of relevant nightclubs in 15 countries, and is unavailable in Greece and Sweden.

all from doctors working in the National Health Service (NHS).
A survey of 265 NHS specialist services, carried out in 2000, revealed that dexamphetamine prescribing was available in about one third of the services surveyed (Rosenberg et al., 2002).
However, the United Kingdom guidelines on clinical management of drug dependence recommend against substitute prescribing of dexamphetamine, due to a lack of demonstrated effectiveness (NTA, 2007).
As yet, no one psychosocial intervention has shown strong evidence of effectiveness in helping psychostimulant users to maintain abstinence.
In the literature, the interventions that have demonstrated the most efficacy in treating users of stimulant drugs are cognitive behavioural approaches such as relapse prevention.
The effectiveness of other types of intervention is not well supported.
The literature is particularly hindered by the paucity of wellconducted studies among primary amphetamine users, especially treatment outcome studies (Baker et al., 2004).
Further research into psychosocial and pharmacological treatment for those with problems related to the use of amphetamines, especially injectors, is needed.
Current treatment practices and treatment coverage in Europe also needs to be better documented, and much remains to be done in the sharing of best practice.
The lack of dedicated programmes might be failing to encourage amphetamine or methamphetamine users to seek treatment, especially at early stages of use.
In addition, the availability of such programmes could help bring more users into treatment; as was found for problem cannabis users in Germany and France, when these countries expanded the availability of dedicated treatment programmes.
Such measures may be particularly useful in those countries that have recently seen a growth in the numbers of problem amphetamine and methamphetamine users, especially injectors (Talu et al., 2009).
Introduction profiles among cocaine users, assessing the prevalence of the drug’s use, its health and social consequences and the necessary responses presents a unique set of challenges.
An overall increase in cocaine use and cocaine seizures has been observed in the European Union during the last decade, although this has been largely confined to western Member States, and major differences exist between countries.
The data available also indicate considerable diversity among cocaine users, both in terms of patterns of use and in terms of sociodemographics.
Those who only experiment with the substance on one or a few occasions make up the largest group.
Another group includes socially integrated regular users who, in some countries, account for a relatively large number of young people.
Some of them will intensify their use of cocaine, or use it over a long period, which may lead to chronic health and social problems and to the need for treatment.
Most of the process to convert coca leaves into cocaine hydrochloride remains located in Colombia, Peru and

Laws to counter drug trafficking in the high seas
Success in disrupting drug trafficking at sea relies on cooperation between states, and this is facilitated by two international conventions.
Bolivia, although it may also occur in other South American countries.
Colombia’s importance in the production of cocaine is corroborated by information on laboratories dismantled and seizures of potassium permanganate, a chemical reagent used in the synthesis of cocaine hydrochloride.
In 2007, 2 471 cocaine laboratories were dismantled (78 % of the world total) and a total of 144 tonnes of potassium permanganate was seized in Colombia (94 % of global seizures) (INCB, 2009a).
Under Article 108 of the International Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982), a state that suspects that a ship flying its flag (1) is involved in drug trafficking can request the help of other states to suppress such trafficking.
This convention establishes a mechanism that allows any state, having reasonable grounds for suspecting that a ship registered in another country is engaged in drug trafficking, to request the ship’s flag state for permission to board the vessel, search for and seize any drugs, and subsequently prosecute the offenders. These acts may take place anywhere outside territorial waters.
Competent national authorities are nominated to act as contact points, permanently on-call, in order to reply to such requests as soon as possible.
Requests may be granted, granted with conditions or refused.
The available information suggests that cocaine continues to be trafficked to Europe via different routes (EMCDDA, 2008d).
Cocaine consignments transit through South and Central American countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela, before reaching Europe.
Caribbean countries are also frequently used in the transhipment of the drug to Europe.
On these routes, cocaine is smuggled through commercial flights or by sea.
In recent years, an alternative route through West Africa has been identified.
From there, cocaine is often transported to Europe by fishing and sailing vessels, though trafficking by air or overland through north Africa has also been reported (Europol, 2007).
Other transiting countries have also been mentioned in recent years.
These include South Africa, Russia, but also countries in central and eastern Europe, where the number of cocaine seizures increased from an estimated 412 cases in 2002 to 1 065 in 2007.
Belgium, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom have been mentioned as important transit countries for cocaine shipments inside Europe.
Seizures quantity of cocaine seized and the highest number of seizures of the drug — about half of the total — in Europe.
Cocaine is the most trafficked drug in the world after herbal cannabis and cannabis resin.
In 2007, global seizures of cocaine remained stable at about 710 tonnes.
South America continued to report the largest amount seized, accounting for 45 % of the global figure, followed by North America with 28 %, and west and central Europe with 11 % (UNODC, 2009).
22 % and 57 % in 2007 ( sufficient data for analysis of trends over time report a decline in the purity of cocaine over the period 2002–07, with the exception of Spain and Portugal.
In Europe, the number of cocaine seizures has been on the increase for the last 20 years, and more notably since 2003.
In 2007, the number of cocaine seizures increased to 92 000 cases, though the total quantity recovered dropped to 77 tonnes, down from 121 tonnes in 2006.
The fall in the total amount of cocaine seized is largely accounted for by Portugal, and to a lesser extent Spain and France, reporting smaller quantities seized in 2007 compared to the previous year (90).
In 2007, Spain continued to be the country reporting both the largest
For those countries reporting sufficient data to make a comparison, cocaine sold on the street became cheaper between 2002 and 2007.
These estimates are likely to be conservative.
Overall, cocaine use appears to be concentrated in a few countries, notably Denmark, Spain, Italy, Ireland and the United Kingdom, while use of the drug remains relatively low elsewhere in Europe.
In countries where amphetamines dominate the market in illicit stimulant drugs, estimates of cocaine use are low in nearly all cases. Conversely, in most countries where cocaine is the main illicit stimulant, low levels of amphetamine use are reported.
Since 2000, cocaine prices adjusted for inflation have been falling in Europe, while the demand for this substance has increased, as shown by the prevalence of cocaine use in the general population and among problem drug users.
This counter-intuitive finding could be explained by several factors.
An increase in the supply of cocaine to Europe, reflected in rising volumes of seizures, is certainly a key factor here.
The search for an alternative to the United States’ market, by South American cocaine traffickers, may be a ‘push’ factor driving the increased targeting of the European market.
Additionally, a ‘pull’ factor may have been the growing demand for cocaine in Europe.
The increased volume of European cocaine consumption together with the relative strength of European currencies compared to the US dollar could have compensated for declining prices and, possibly, smaller profit margins.
Only a small proportion of those who have used cocaine at least once in their life appear to develop intensive patterns of use.
Data from general population surveys suggest high discontinuation rates among cocaine users.
In countries where lifetime prevalence is above 2 %, most adults who have ever used cocaine (80–95 %) have not used it within the last month (92).
Other factors, however, might also have influenced the price of cocaine.
Technological developments and the use of new trafficking routes, such as the West African route, where drug control is poorly enforced and which provides low-paid traffickers, could have led to a decrease in transportation costs and a reduction of trafficking risks.
More competition inside the cocaine market (Desroches, 2007) might also have influenced the drug’s price in Europe.
The lack of data in this area makes this analysis necessarily speculative and underlines the importance of obtaining a better understanding of the factors that influence Europe’s drug market.
The EMCDDA is committed to continue developing collaborations and research in this area.
The European average for last year use of cocaine among this age group is estimated at 2.2 % (3 million) and for last month use at 0.8 % (1 million).
Use is particularly high among young males (15–34 years), with last year prevalence of cocaine use reported at between 4.2 % and 7.7 % in Denmark, Spain, Ireland,
Cocaine use among the general population
Overall, cocaine remains the second most used illicit drug in Europe, after cannabis, though levels of use vary greatly between countries.
It is estimated that around 13 million Europeans have used it at least once in their lifetime, on average 3.9 % of adults aged 15–64 years (see Table 8 for a summary of the data).
National figures vary from 0.1 % to 8.3 %, with 12 out of 23 countries, including most central and eastern European countries, reporting low levels of lifetime prevalence among all adults (0.5–2 %).
Last year prevalence of cocaine use among 15- to 24-year-olds is estimated at 2.2 %, which translates into 1.5 million users in Europe.
In contrast to the prevalence estimates for cannabis or ecstasy use, which are highest among the 15–24 age group, measures of more recent cocaine use (last year and last month) are similar among the 15–34 and the 15–24 age groups (94).
Cocaine use is also associated with alcohol use and certain lifestyles.

not visited a pub.
Visiting nightclubs was also associated with increased cocaine use, as nearly 10 % of the 16- to 24-year-olds who visited a club on four or more occasions during the last month report last year use of cocaine, compared with 3.3 % among those who had not visited a club.
The survey also reported low levels of crack use, even among cocaine users, confirming findings from other studies that report differences in the profiles of the users of these two substances (Hoare and Flatley, 2008).
Lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among 15- to 16-year-old school students in the ESPAD survey is between 1 % and 2 % in half of the 28 reporting countries.
Most of the remaining countries report prevalence levels of between 3 % and 4 %, while France, Italy and the United Kingdom report 5 %.
Lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among males is higher than that among females in most countries, and the highest levels (6 %) are reported by France and Italy (95).
International comparisons
The 2008 Eurobarometer survey, which was conducted in the 27 EU Member States, shows that 85 % of 15- to 25-year-olds perceive cocaine use as a high risk to a person’s health.
The proportions of respondents perceiving a similar level of health risk from using other substances are much lower: 40 % for cannabis, 28 % for tobacco and 24 % for alcohol.
Only heroin use is perceived as a high risk by a greater proportion of respondents.
There is little variation between countries, and 95 % of the respondents considered that cocaine should continue to be banned (European Commission, 2008b).
Estimates of the prevalence of cocaine use among school students are much lower than those for cannabis use.

Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Among those entering treatment for the first time, the proportion reporting cocaine as their primary drug is higher (22 %).
Network (DAWN) estimated that cocaine, alone or in combination with other drugs, was involved in six out of every 10 drugrelated emergency visits in 2006.
Spain reports the highest proportions among all clients (45 %) and new clients (60 %), followed by the Netherlands (32 % and 29 %) and Italy (23 % and 26 %).
In Belgium, Ireland, Cyprus, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom, cocaine clients represent between 11 % and 13 % of all drug clients and between 11 % and 19 % of new clients; elsewhere in Europe, cocaine accounts for less than 10 % of drug treatment clients, with seven countries reporting less than 1 % (98).
Cocaine injection and crack use are associated with the highest health risks (including cardiovascular and mental health problems, health deterioration). These are generally aggravated by social marginalisation and additional specific problems, such as the risks associated with injection.
The concomitant use of opioids and cocaine appears to be linked to a higher risk of opioid overdose (EMCDDA, 2007a).
Dependence is one of the negative consequences of cocaine use for the individual.
A study conducted in the United States showed that about 5 % of cocaine users can become dependent in the first year of use, though not more than around 20 % of users developed dependence in the long term (Wagner and Anthony, 2002).
Another study showed that, among those who become dependent, close to 40 % recover without drug or alcohol treatment (Cunningham, 2000).
There is also evidence that many cocaine users controlled their use of the drug by setting rules, for example, about the amount, frequency or context of use (Decorte, 2000).
Problem cocaine use and treatment demand
Profile of treatment clients and Italy, while regional and crack cocaine estimates (97
Cocaine clients have one of the largest male to female ratios (five men for every woman) and one of the highest mean ages (around 32 years) among drug treatment clients.
This is particularly the case in some countries with large numbers of primary cocaine clients, especially Italy where the sex ratio is 8:1 and the mean age 35 years.
are available for the United Kingdom. In Italy, in 2007, there were estimated to be between 3.8 and 4.7 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults.
According to the most recent data for Spain, in 2002 there were between 4.5 and 6 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adult population (15–64 years).
Estimates of problem cocaine users probably underestimate the population in need of treatment or brief interventions, because socially integrated problem cocaine users might be underrepresented in the data sources used.
Chapter 5: Cocaine and crack cocaine especially among clients with a primary heroin problem
Crack cocaine use in Europe
Cocaine is available in two forms in Europe: as cocaine powder (cocaine HCI, a hydrochloride salt) and the less commonly used crack cocaine (a free base).
Crack is typically smoked, and is known for inducing an intense ‘high’ that may lead to problematic patterns of use.
In general, it is manufactured from cocaine HCl in locations close to where it is retailed and used.
In 2007, around 8 000 clients are reported to have entered outpatient treatment for primary use of crack cocaine, representing 15 % of all cocaine clients and 2.7 % of all drug clients in outpatient treatment.
Most crack clients (around 6 500) are reported by the United Kingdom, where they account for 45 % of the cocaine clients in treatment.
Almost one quarter (22 %) of primary crack clients also use heroin, and these clients report high levels of unemployment and homelessness (104).
The use of crack started to spread in the United States in the mid-1980s, mainly in deprived inner city sections of metropolitan areas, disproportionately affecting ethnic minorities.
It has been feared that a similar phenomenon could happen in Europe but, until now, a serious crack epidemic has not been observed.
Crack cocaine is, however, used in some European cities, although it is difficult to know the exact size of the phenomenon.
Reports on the situation in London (GLADA, 2004) and Dublin (Connolly et al., 2008) also suggest that increases can take place.
In London, crack use is considered to be a major component of the city’s drugs problem, and its increase since the mid 1990s is mainly attributed to a growing population of opioid users who also use crack.
The first group typically reports snorting the drug, and sometimes consuming it in conjunction with other substances such as alcohol or cannabis, but not with opioids. Some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system.
The second group often reports injecting drugs, uses both cocaine and opioids, sometimes smokes crack, and presents precarious health and social conditions.
It includes former heroin users re-entering drug treatment for cocaine use.
Most of the treatment demands related to crack and most of the seizures of the drug are reported by the United Kingdom.
One study has estimated the number of problem crack cocaine users in England at 5.2–5.6 per 1 000 adult population in 2006–07.
Sizable crack problems have also been reported by cities in other European countries.
Crack use occurs mainly among marginalised and disadvantaged groups such as sex workers and problem opioid users, and some countries report it among specific ethnic minorities (e.g. France, Netherlands, United Kingdom).
Among socially integrated individuals, including regular powder cocaine users, crack use is very unusual (Prinzleve et al., 2004).
Nevertheless, the persistence of crack use in some groups and cities underlines the risk of its spread to larger populations.
In Europe, public drug treatment facilities are mostly oriented towards the needs of opioid users, and those focusing on the treatment of cocaine users are rare and often private.
Some countries (e.g. Ireland, Italy, Spain), however, have implemented strategies or treatment programmes targeting cocaine users, and France is in the process of developing such programmes.
Almost half the cocaine clients start using the drug before the age of 20, and 88 % before the age of 30.
Long time lags (9–12 years) between first cocaine use and first treatment entry are reported in Spain, Italy and the
Netherlands (
Most cocaine clients snort (55 %) or smoke (32 %) the drug and less than 7 % report injecting it (102
Certain populations of cocaine users are hard to reach, and therefore difficult to get into treatment. For instance, marginalised cocaine injectors and crack users often do not seek treatment voluntarily.
For this reason, in Ireland outreach work and other interventions are recommended in order to attract into treatment users who would otherwise not be reached (Connolly et al., 2008).
Outreach treatment programmes can also be beneficial for certain groups.
Among them, 42 % also use alcohol, 28 % cannabis and 16 % heroin. Cocaine is also often mentioned as a secondary drug,
(101)See Tables TDI-10, TDI-11 (part iii), TDI-21 and TDI-103 (part ii) in the 2009 statistical bulletin.(102) See Table TDI-17 (part iv) in the 2009 statistical bulletin.
See ‘Crack cocaine use in Europe’, and Tables TDI-7 and TDI-115 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.
Germany, Ireland, Austria, the Netherlands, France and Spain estimated that they were available only to a minority of them.
For example, they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where opioid users are the main clientele. Measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries.
For example, in Italy, ‘Progetto nazionale cocaina’, launched in 2007, provides specialised services with opening times more suitable for socially integrated cocaine users and their families (e.g. after work).
A similar approach is also reported in Ireland, where specific programmes are developed to attract powder cocaine users.
Following a period during which almost all the research originated in the United States, several studies on the treatment of cocaine dependence are now carried out in Europe.
In the United Kingdom, a clinical trial is investigating the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy in conjunction with contingency management (see EMCDDA, 2008b) in primary cocaine users.
According to a recent Cochrane review, this combination has yielded the best results for the treatment of stimulant dependence (Knapp et al., 2007).
Another clinical trial in the United Kingdom is investigating the efficacy of modafinil, in conjunction with voucher-based contingency management, among patients receiving opioid substitution treatment and using crack cocaine.
Modafinil has already shown therapeutic potential in several trials as a substitute agent for stimulant dependence.
The results showed a significant reduction of cocaine consumption compared with the standard treatment.
It is also important to maintain problem cocaine and crack users in treatment, as intensive cocaine use is associated with behavioural, social and psychological dysfunctions (e.g. impulsive and aggressive behaviour) and, in some groups, with chaotic lifestyles and severe mental and physical deterioration.
Thus, maintaining regular attendance at therapy sessions and meaningful therapeutic dialogue is reported as difficult by professionals (Connolly et al., 2008).
Use of cocaine can also disrupt treatment for dependence on other drugs and jeopardise successfully achieved abstinence from heroin.
In Germany for example, concomitant cocaine use has been identified as a decisive factor in those dropping out of opioid substitution treatment.
Finally, a joint Spanish and Italian multisite study is investigating the efficacy of the cocaine vaccine TA-CD.
It is the largest trial conducted on this vaccine to date, with several hundred volunteers participating.
Initial safety studies of the TA-CD vaccine in the US have shown reductions in the subjective effects of cocaine and in the use of the drug, and better treatment retention.
Attracting and maintaining users in treatment is also difficult in a context where there is no particular psychosocial intervention with strong evidence of effectiveness and no effective pharmacotherapy available to help dependent users maintain abstinence or reduce use during this period.
Harmreduction interventions targeting problem crack and cocaine users is a new area of work in many Member States.
One reason for the limited provision of interventions in this field, in particular for crack users, might be a lack of knowledge among key workers about the drug, the target group and their needs.
These difficulties can be tackled by the development of specific treatment programmes and training courses adapted to the problems associated with cocaine and crack use.
Cocaine-specific training for treatment staff is reported from Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom.
In addition, 11 Member States, including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand, report that specific treatment programmes, alongside traditional treatment services, are available for cocaine or crack cocaine users.
However, while national experts from Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and the United Kingdom estimated that these programmes were available to a majority of cocaine users in need of treatment, experts from Denmark,
Member States usually provide cocaine-injecting users with the same services and facilities as are provided to opioid users, including: recommendations for safer use, training for safer injecting, and needle and syringe programmes.
However, cocaine injecting can be associated with higher risks of equipment sharing and with frequent injection, which can lead to vein collapse
Chapter 5: Cocaine and crack cocaine and to injecting in higher-risk parts of the body (e.g. the legs, hands, feet and groin). Therefore, safer use recommendations should be adapted to these specific risks.
Programmes offer advice and information to young people on the risks associated with alcohol and drug use in general, usually including material on the risks of cocaine use.
However, large seizures of opium and morphine in neighbouring countries (Pakistan, Iran) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan (CND, 2008; UNODC, 2009).
Heroin use, particularly injecting the drug, has been closely associated with problem drug use in Europe since the 1970s.
Today, this drug still accounts for the greatest share of morbidity and mortality related to drug use in the European Union.
A decline in heroin use and associated problems has been observed in the last 10 years, though more recent data suggest that, in some countries, the trend may have changed direction.
In addition, reports of the use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, and the injection of stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, reflect the increasingly multi-faceted nature of problem drug use in Europe.

Heroin consumed in Europe originates predominantly in Afghanistan, which accounts for most of the global illicit opium output.
The other producing countries are Myanmar, which mainly supplies markets in east and southeast Asia, Pakistan, Laos, followed by Mexico and Colombia, which are considered the largest suppliers of heroin to the United States (UNODC, 2009).
Global opium production is estimated to have decreased from a peak in 2007, mainly due to a decrease in Afghan production from 8 890 tonnes to some 8 000 tonnes in 2008.
The most recent estimate of global potential heroin production is 735 tonnes in 2007 (UNODC, 2009).

Heroin prices at different levels of the market
East and East Africa to illicit markets in Europe (INCB, 2009a; WCO, 2008).
Heroin from south-west Asia is also smuggled directly to Europe (United Kingdom) by air from Pakistan.
Within the European Union, the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Belgium play an important role as secondary distribution hubs (Europol, 2008).
Worldwide reported seizures of opium increased markedly in 2007 to 510 tonnes, with Iran accounting for 84 % of the total.
Global reported seizures of morphine decreased sharply to 27 tonnes, while global heroin seizures increased slightly to 65 tonnes.
The largest seizures of heroin were reported by Iran (25 % of the world total), followed by Turkey and Afghanistan (UNODC, 2009).
Comparable data on both wholesale and retail prices for 2007 are available for only a few countries (Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Romania, United Kingdom).
Among these countries, the reported wholesale price of heroin ranges from EUR 12.5 to EUR 35.8 per gram, and the mean retail price, where available, ranges from EUR 36 to EUR 62.7.
At both wholesale and retail levels of the market, the lowest prices are reported for Romania and the highest for Spain.
The ratio between retail and wholesale price also varies considerably, from 1.6:1 in the Czech Republic to 2.8:1 in the United Kingdom.
Possible differences in drug purity, either between countries, market levels or over time, necessitate caution when making comparisons.
Nonetheless, analysis in this area can be informative, especially in respect to trends over time as it can point to important changes taking place in the market.
In Europe, an estimated 58 000 seizures resulted in the interception of 22 tonnes of heroin in 2007.
The United Kingdom continued to report the highest number of seizures, while Turkey again reported the greatest quantity seized, with 13.2 tonnes recovered in 2007 (106).
Data for the years 2002–07 from 25 reporting countries indicate that after a fall in the first year, the number of seizures has increased steadily since 2003.
The overall trend in the quantity of heroin intercepted in Turkey differs from that observed in the European Union.
While Turkey reported a five-fold increase in the quantity of heroin seized between 2002 and 2007, the amount seized in the European Union has shown an overall decline during this period, albeit with an increase from 2006 to 2007.
Global seizures of acetic anhydride (used to manufacture heroin) increased to 56 300 litres in 2007, with almost half of it recovered in Russia (25 000 litres), followed by Turkey (13 300 litres) and Slovenia (6 500 litres) (INCB, 2009b).
The INCB estimates that ‘almost 80 %’ of the acetic anhydride used in Afghan heroin laboratories is smuggled through eastern and south-eastern Europe, and encourages the EU Commission and EU Member States to prevent the diversion of acetic anhydride from the internal market (INCB, 2009a).
Purity and price
Data in this section are derived from the EMCDDA problem drug use (PDU) indicator, which includes mainly injecting drug use and the use of opioids, although in a few countries users of amphetamines or cocaine constitute an important component.
It is worth noting that many countries report that most ‘problem opioid users’ could be described as polydrug users who also use opioids.
Given the relatively low prevalence and the hidden nature of this
In 2007, for most reporting countries the mean purity of brown heroin tested ranged between 15 % and 30 %, although values under 15 % were reported in France (12 %) and Austria (9 %), and higher ones in the United Kingdom (50 %) and Norway (35 %).
Note that where data for 2007 is absent, the corresponding data for 2006 are used to estimate European totals.
This analysis is preliminary as data for the United Kingdom are not yet available for 2007.)
See Tables PPP-2 and PPP-6 in the 2009 statistical bulletin for purity and price data.

Figure 10: Estimates of the annual prevalence of problem opioid use (cases per 1 000 population aged 15–64) type of drug use, statistical extrapolations are required to obtain prevalence estimates from the available data sources.
0 Estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use in European countries during the period 2002–07 range roughly between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15–64; overall prevalence of problem drug use is estimated to range from under three cases to 10 cases per 1 000.
The countries reporting the lowest welldocumented estimates of problem opioid use are the Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland and Finland (though both the Czech Republic and Finland have large numbers of problem users of amphetamines), while the highest estimates are reported by Malta, Italy, Austria and Spain (Figure 10).
NB: The symbol indicates a point estimate; a bar indicates an estimation uncertainty interval: a 95 % confidence interval, or one based on sensitivity analysis.
Target groups may vary slightly, owing to different estimation methods and data sources; therefore, comparisons should be made with caution.
Nonstandard age ranges were used in the studies from Finland (15–54), Malta (12–64) and Poland (all ages).
All three rates were adjusted to the population aged 15–64, assuming that drug use in other age groups will be negligible.
For Germany and Cyprus, the interval represents the highest and lowest bounds of all existing estimates, and the point estimate a simple average of the midpoints.
Methods of estimation are abbreviated: CR = capture–recapture; TM = treatment multiplier; MI = multivariate indicator; MM = mortality multiplier; CM = combined methods; OT = other methods.
Opioids, mainly heroin, continue to be cited as the principal drug by the majority of those seeking treatment in Europe.
However, considerable differences exist across Europe in the proportion of drug users entering treatment for problems related to these drugs; with opioid clients accounting for more than 90 % of those entering treatment in Bulgaria and Slovenia, between 50 % and 90 % in 15 countries, and between 10 % and 49 % in a further nine (109).
Overall, of the around 325 000 treatment entries for which the primary drug is known, 49 % cited heroin as their primary drug; if other opioids are included, time (112).
The percentage of primary opioid users among this figure rises to 55 % of these clients (110
In some countries, both the proportion and the number of treatment entries related to opioids other than heroin have increased
1 11 those clients who were in treatment for more than 1 year was reported to be over 50 % in all countries participating in the study.
Clients entering treatment for primary opioid use often report the use of other drugs.
In 2006, an analysis of data from 14 countries found that 59 % of heroin clients use a secondary drug, mainly cocaine (28 %), cannabis (14 %)
Many opioid users are enrolled in programmes providing long-term care.
This is reflected in a higher proportion of primary opioid users among drug users already in treatment.
A recent analysis of data on clients in drug treatment in 14 countries found that primary opioid users and alcohol (7 %) (113).
) This estimate has been adjusted from 1.5 to 1.4 million on the basis of new data.
Because of large confidence intervals and the fact that the estimate is based on data from different years, it is not possible to conclude that the new estimate indicates a decrease in the prevalence of problem opioid use in Europe.
(109) See Table TDI-5 (part ii) in the 2009 statistical bulletin.

Incidence of problem opioid use
Monitoring the incidence of problem drug use — the number of individuals who start using a substance during a given year and who become problem drug users — is necessary in order to track trends in Europe’s drug situation and to devise suitable policies and interventions.
Where adequate and up to date estimates of the incidence and prevalence of problem opioid use are not available, it may still be possible to analyse trends over time using other, mainly indirect, indicators such as treatment demand data.
Based on a sample of 19 countries, the overall number of primary heroin users entering treatment increased between 2002 and 2007.
Focusing on a more recent time frame, users entering treatment for primary heroin use increased both in number and as a proportion of all drug clients in eight countries between 2006 and 2007. These increases often followed marked decreases in previous years.
Furthermore, since as early as 2004, 10 countries report increases in both the number and proportion of new clients entering treatment with heroin as the primary drug (115).
The EMCDDA has been stimulating research into estimating the incidence of problem drug use and has recently published guidelines on this topic (Scalia Tomba et al., 2008).
It has also launched, in collaboration with the University of Zurich, a study to test a new ‘one-day’ method using the distribution of ‘latency time’ (time to treatment) in a cross-sectional sample of treated heroin users.
The method uses a function that describes the probability of being in substitution treatment (General Inclusion Function, GIF) when no regulations restrict access to treatment, taking into account latency time, mortality and rates of drug use cessation.
Estimates can be derived from treatment data for a single day, whereas the established methods need long time series covering at least 8 to 10 years.
The study was conducted in six EU Member States (Spain, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Slovakia, United Kingdom) and suggested that the GIF method allows the estimation of incidence of problem heroin use, even with incomplete substitution treatment data sets.
In at least five regions, the incidence estimates allowed the derivation of prevalence estimates that were in a good accordance with other existing estimates (e.g. by the capture–recapture method).
Similarly, a decline noted in the number of heroin seizures in the European Union until 2003 has now been replaced by a steady increase. In the most recent data on drug law offences, an increase in the number of heroin-related cases may also be observed.
The GIF method seems to be robust and might, in addition to incidence estimates, also provide cost-effective estimates of problem opioid use prevalence as well as of substitution treatment coverage, and their change over time.
Future work might include studies in other EU countries, analyses of spatial differences and by gender and routes of administration.
The available data suggest that the downward trend in opioid indicators observed until 2003 has levelled off.
This is perhaps most clearly visible since 2003 among seizures and druginduced deaths, and after 2004 in new treatment demands related to heroin use.
These changes have occurred alongside increased opium production in Afghanistan, raising concerns that these events might be linked through increased availability of heroin on the European market.
Injecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use, such as blood-borne infections (e.g. HIV/AIDS, hepatitis) or druginduced deaths.
Only 12 countries were able to provide recent estimates of the levels of injecting drug
Data from nine countries with repeated prevalence estimates during the period 2002–07 suggest a relatively stable situation.
In Cyprus, an estimate made in 2007 indicates that there has been a significant increase in problem opioid use, which has been linked with an increase in foreign nationals in treatment (114). Information from the
Chapter 6: Opioid use and drug injection
EMCDDA ‘Selected issue’ on injecting drug use
Another indicator of more recent initiation into injecting is the proportion of young injectors (under age 25) found in samples.
These accounted for more than 40 % of injectors sampled in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Romania and Slovakia, whereas less than 20 % of injectors sampled were under 25 years of age in 11 other countries.
Injecting drug use is one of the main determinants of serious public health problems among drug users, including HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C and overdose.
Across Europe, the prevalence and trends of injecting drug use vary between Member States, and may change over time.
Alternative routes of administration (e.g. smoking) may co-exist with drug injecting, and drug users may alter their route of administration.
Injecting among opioid users
The ‘Selected issue’ focuses on the situation and trends of injecting drug use and on specific interventions that target injecting drug users in Europe.
The publication also discusses the possible mechanisms behind decreases of drug injecting observed in some countries or regions, and why levels may still be high (or increasing) in other regions.
It also discusses interventions and policies that aim to reduce injecting and those that may promote users to adopt less harmful routes of administration.
This ‘Selected issue’ is available in print and on the Internet in English only (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/selected-issues/injecting-drug-use) from December 2009.
Injecting is frequently reported as the usual mode of administration by opioid users entering treatment, accounting for over half of opioid clients in most countries, between 25 % and 50 % in seven countries and less than 25 % in five countries.
The lowest proportions of injectors among opioid users entering treatment are reported by Denmark and the Netherlands, and the highest by Lithuania, Latvia and Romania (120).
Treatment reports also suggest that among opioid users, the popularity of injecting may vary considerably within countries. For example, in the autonomous communities of Spain the proportion of injectors among new opioid clients ranges from 0.9 % to 47.2 %.
Improving the level of information available on this special population continues to be an important challenge for the development of health monitoring systems in Europe.
This is the case in almost all of the 22 reporting countries.
An analysis of the data on drug users in treatment in 14 countries found that injection among all drug users in treatment remains high, at 62 %, though there are some notable exceptions, such as the Netherlands with a value of 6.1 % (121).
The available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the prevalence of injecting drug use.
The lack of data makes drawing conclusions on time trends in the prevalence of injecting difficult, although the available data suggest a stable situation in the Czech
An increase was also observed in Cyprus.
The proportion of injectors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007. This trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed (e.g. Czech Republic, Germany).
Between 2002 and 2007, the proportion of injectors among primary opioid clients entering treatment has decreased in most countries, with statistically significant declines reported in 13 countries.
Two countries, however, report an increase over this period (Bulgaria, Slovakia) (122).
Data from infectious disease surveys may also provide information on national differences and changes over time regarding drug injection. Comparisons between countries should, however, be made with caution due to the variety of recruitment settings used.
Relatively high proportions (above 20 %) of new injecting drug users (injecting for less than 2 years) have been found in three countries, possibly indicating significant new recruitment into injecting. In
Other studies generally confirm a declining trend of injection among opioid users.
In France, for example, a decrease in the prevalence of injecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001, and studies reveal that initiation of heroin use has become increasingly

Comorbidity: drug use and mental disorders
Co-morbidity is the often unrecognised co-occurrence of drug use problems and psychiatric disorders in the same individual.
Studies have identified both an elevated prevalence of psychiatric problems among patients in drug treatment and an elevated prevalence of drug problems among patients in psychiatric services (EMCDDA, 2005).
Opioid analgesics are the most powerful drugs available for the management of severe and chronic pain.
Opioids are also used as substitution drugs in the management of opioid dependence.
These drugs, available on prescription, can be misused and this may lead to adverse health effects such as dependence, overdose and harms associated with injection.
Prescription opioids may enter the illicit drug market through the diversion of substitution drugs from their proper use.
Internet pharmacies seem also to play a substantial role in the availability of prescription opioids in the United States (INCB, 2009a), but their role in Europe appears to be limited.
In Europe, the expansion in the prescription of substitution drugs to opioid-dependent drug users has been accompanied by increasing reports of the misuse of these drugs.
The mental disorders most commonly reported among drug users in Europe include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, personality disorders, attention deficit and hyperactivity.
Specific treatment for drug users with co-morbidity in Europe remains limited.
National experts report that specific programmes exist in 18 countries, but in 14 of these they are available only to a minority of clients in need.
In seven other countries, there are no dedicated programmes at all, but five of them plan to develop such programmes in the next 3 years.
A European prospective multi-centre study (Isadora) has recently been conducted involving dual-diagnosis patients
Its findings highlight the difficulties of comparative analyses in this area, underlining the need for a more harmonised approach for diagnosis, treatment and study of co-morbidity in Europe (Baldacchino et al., 2009).
Opioids other than heroin are reported as the primary drug by about 5 % (17 810) of clients entering drug treatment in Europe.
The most frequently reported substances are: buprenorphine, which in Finland is recorded as the primary drug for 41 % of all treatment demands and in France for 7 %; methadone, which accounts for 18.5 % of all treatment demands in Denmark; and other prescription opioids in Latvia, Austria and Sweden, where they account for between 5 % and 15 % of all treatment demands (1).
The German Phar-Mon system, which monitors a wide range of medications that have potential for misuse, also recorded an increase in the misuse of prescription opioids, where substitution drugs play a more important role than analgesics (Roesner and Küfner, 2007).
in the Member States that have joined the EU since 2004 are on average younger than their counterparts.
The misuse of prescription opioids raises important issues regarding the prevention of diversion of substitution drugs and opioid analgesics to the illicit market.
At the same time, care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substances is not compromised (Cherny et al., 2006).
Female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group.
Overall, the male to female ratio among opioid clients is 3.5:1, though females make up a higher proportion of opioid clients in northern countries (e.g. Sweden, Finland) and a lower proportion in southern

associated with snorting, and injection now appears to occur at a later stage of the drug using career than it did in the past.
Opioid users entering treatment report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment than other clients (see Chapter 2).
High levels of psychiatric disorders are reported in this population; for example an Italian study found that most (72 %) drug treatment clients with a concomitant psychiatric morbidity were primary opioid users (125).
Treatment of problem opioid use
The mean age of clients entering outpatient treatment for primary opioid use is 33 years and almost all countries
Almost all opioid users entering treatment report initiation before the age of 30 and about half before the age of 20.
An average time lag of about 8 years is reported between have reported an increase since 2003 (123

In a few countries, inpatient centres are a major component of the drug treatment system, notably in Bulgaria, Greece, Finland and Sweden (127).
The range of options available in Europe for the treatment of opioid dependence is broad and increasingly differentiated, though it varies geographically in terms of accessibility and coverage.
Drug-free and substitution treatment for opioid use are available in all EU Member States, Croatia and Norway. In Turkey, the future use of substitution treatment is currently under study.
NB: The percentage of substitution treatment clients receiving their treatment from general practitioners in the Community is indicated on the map.Sources: Reitox national focal points.
Drug-free treatment is a therapeutic approach, which generally requires individuals to abstain from all substances, including substitution medication.
especially for younger or first-time clients, or due to difficulties in gaining access to substitution treatment.
In Greece for example, the waiting time for opioid substitution treatment is on average more than 3 years.
In four countries (Estonia, Luxembourg, Hungary, Netherlands), it is estimated to be provided only to a minority of clients in substitution treatment.
Substitution treatment, generally integrated with psychosocial care, is typically provided at specialised outpatient centres. Thirteen countries report that substitution treatment is also provided by general practitioners, usually under shared-care arrangements with specialised treatment centres (see Figure 11).
In the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Croatia, any general practitioner may provide substitution treatment, while in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Austria and Norway, only those that are specifically trained or accredited are entitled to provide it.
A number of countries report that, by improving geographical coverage, reducing waiting times and facilitating access to treatment, the involvement of general practitioners has helped to improve the availability and coverage of substitution treatment (Czech Republic, Germany, France, Austria, United Kingdom).
According to expert estimates, the availability of opioid substitution treatment is relatively high in 16 countries, where it is available to at least half of opioid users (see Chapter 2).
In those countries, drug-free treatment is the treatment of choice for between 10 % and 25 % of opioid users.
In a further 10 countries (Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Finland, Norway), substitution treatment is estimated to be available to a minority of opioid users.
The total number of clients receiving substitution treatment in the EU, Croatia and Norway is estimated to be about 650 000 in 2007, up from 560 000 in 2005 and 500 000 in 2003.
The available data suggest an increase in all countries except Spain, where the numbers receiving substitution treatment have been declining since 2002, and France, Luxembourg, Hungary and the Netherlands, where small decreases or stable figures are reported.
Among the countries that have expanded their provision of substitution treatment, the highest rates of increase have been seen in Estonia, where the number of clients increased within 5 years from 60 to more than 1 000, and Bulgaria, where the number of treatment places increased from 380 to nearly 3 000 between 2003 and 2007. The number of clients in substitution treatment has also more than doubled
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe over this period in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Finland and Norway, while increases in excess of 40 % are reported by Greece, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden.
A simple comparison of the estimated number of problem opioid users and of delivered treatments suggests that more than 40 % could be receiving substitution treatment.
However, there is still a lack of precision in both data sets, and this estimate should be viewed with caution.
Comparisons are difficult for the same reason, though available data indicate that the proportion of problem opioid users receiving substitution treatment differs considerably between countries, with estimated rates ranging from 5 % to over 50 % (128).
A set of minimum requirements and international guidelines for psychosocially assisted pharmacological treatment of persons dependent on opioids was recently developed by WHO (2009).
This document is a response to a resolution from the United Nations Economic and Social Council (Ecosoc) and it is based on systematic reviews of the scientific literature and consultations with a range of renowned experts from different parts of the world.
Drugrelated infectious diseases highest rates of newly reported infections, Portugal and Estonia continued their downward trends, although in Portugal this trend seems to be levelling off.
In contrast, in Latvia an increase from 47.1 cases per million population in 2006 to 58.7 cases per million in 2007 was reported (Figure 12).
Infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis B and C are among the most serious health consequences of drug use.
Even in countries where HIV prevalence in injecting drug users is low, other infectious diseases including hepatitis A, B and C, sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, tetanus, botulism and human T-lymphotropic virus may disproportionately affect drug users.
The EMCDDA is systematically monitoring HIV and hepatitis B and C among injecting drug users (prevalence of antibodies, or other specific markers in the case of hepatitis B) (129).
Overall, marked increases in new HIV infection have not been observed between 2002 and 2007, and reported rates remain low.
However, in Bulgaria and Sweden, the rate of newly reported infections accelerated — from 0.3 new cases per million population in 2002 to 5.6 cases in 2007 in Bulgaria, and in Sweden from 3.5 new cases per million in 2002 to a peak of 6.7 cases in 2007 before returning to previous levels in 2008 — suggesting the continued potential for HIV outbreaks among injecting drug users.
Prevalence data are

Recent studies (2006–07) show a wide range of prevalence levels among injecting drug users under 25 years and those injecting for less than 2 years, suggesting different levels of HCV incidence in those populations across Europe (136
However, some insight into the epidemiology of these infections may be provided by the proportion of injecting drug users among all notified cases where risk factors are known (Wiessing et al., 2008a).
For hepatitis B, the proportion of injecting drug users has declined between 2002 and 2007 in four out of 17 countries.
The prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B virus (HBV) also varies to a great extent, possibly partly due to differences in vaccination levels, although other factors may play a role.
The most complete data set available is that for the antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen (antiHBc), which indicates a history of infection.
For 2006–07, three of the 10 countries providing data on injecting drug users report anti-HBc prevalence levels of over 40 % (137).
Seventeen EU Member States and Turkey report that the prevention of infectious diseases among drug users is part of their national drug strategy, and six other countries report that it is the subject of a specific strategy.
Ten of these 23 countries also report existing strategies to prevent infectious diseases at local or regional level.
Trends over time in notified cases of hepatitis B and C show different pictures, but these are difficult to interpret.
Hepatitis C prevalence as a possible indicator of injection-related HIV risk
A group of modellers and epidemiologists brought together by the EMCDDA has examined the potential for using information on the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) among drug injectors as an indicator of HIV transmission risk.
HCV is transmitted via needle sharing in similar ways to HIV.
As HCV is much more infectious, it might reveal the overall level of risk behaviour, including needle sharing, paraphernalia sharing and changing of injecting partner, in populations of injecting drug users where HIV has not yet spread.
EU Member States respond to the spread of infectious diseases among drug users by a combination of approaches, including: drug treatment; the provision of sterile injection equipment; and communitybased activities that provide information, education, testing and behavioural interventions, often through outreach or lowthreshold agencies.
Experts from 27 countries reported on the level of priority given to selected interventions to prevent infectious diseases among drug users (139).
Access to sterile injecting equipment through needle and syringe programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries, testing and counselling for infectious diseases by 16 countries and the dissemination of information, education and communication material by 14 countries.
Access to sterile syringes is the most frequently reported priority, as was found in a similar exercise carried out in 2005. An increased number of countries now report infectious disease counselling and testing, and targeted hepatitis immunisation programmes as a priority.
Analysis of paired HCV and HIV prevalence data has shown that HCV prevalence among injectors of up to about 30 % (95 % confidence interval, 21–38 %) is associated with zero or very low prevalence of HIV.
At higher levels of HCV prevalence, a linear relationship was found between HIV and HCV prevalence, and time series data suggest that the observed HIV prevalence increases at about half the rate of HCV prevalence.
These results suggest that HCV prevalence could be used to help develop targeted prevention and harmreduction interventions among injecting drug users.
In addition, it might also be used to assess the risk of an HIV outbreak in countries where HIV prevalence among injecting drug users is still low.
Research has shown that sustained treatment is associated with reductions in injecting drug use and related risk behaviours, and thereby with protection from HIV infection.
In most European countries, harm reduction and treatment service provision have increased considerably since the mid-1990s (Hedrich et al., 2008b). Opioid
See Table INF-115 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.)
Chapter 7: Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths drug users, involving peer educators, are also reported by 17 countries.
Treatment of injecting drug users with chronic hepatitis C
Up to 30 % of patients with untreated chronic hepatitis C will develop liver cirrhosis within 30 years, and the costs incurred in the management of end-stage liver disease are considerable (Jager et al., 2004).
To reduce the burden of hepatitis C in Europe, it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group — chronic carriers of the virus who are active drug injectors.
Needle and syringe programmes exist in all EU Member States, Croatia and Norway.
The programme in Cyprus, however, has hardly been used in 2007. In 15 countries, most injecting drug users are estimated to have received syringes from such a programme during the last 12 months at least once.
In 11 countries, only a minority of injectors received syringes during the same period, despite nine of these countries listing access to sterile injecting equipment as a priority measure to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
Current treatments for chronic hepatitis C — a 6 to 12 months course of combination therapy with longacting interferon and ribavirin — are effective with more than 50 % of patients achieving a sustained virological response.
Although the number of long-term studies remains limited, available research has shown good compliance and success in antiviral treatment of injecting drug users (e.g. Moussalli et al., 2007).
Cost-effectiveness of treating hepatitis C in prisons (Sutton et al., 2008) and the safety and effectiveness of the treatment for drug users with co-morbid psychiatric disorders have also been shown (Loftis et al., 2006).
The number of syringes provided through needle and syringe programmes increased between 2005 and 2007 in 18 of the 26 countries for which data are available.
Access of drug users to hepatitis C treatment, however, remains low.
Reasons for this might include insufficient treatment capacity, lack of information about treatment options, or low prioritisation of drug users.
Several EU countries, including Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have in recent years reviewed their policies in order to expand access to testing and treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus carriers who are active injecting drug users.
The total number of syringes given out in 2007 was 33 % higher than in the year 2003 in the 14 countries for which reliable data or estimations are available.
Ongoing increases over this period were reported from Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and Finland.
The number of syringes supplied in Latvia remained the same, while decreases were reported in Spain, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and Poland.
Hepatitis C therapy in the context of drug addiction is sometimes challenging, but it can improve with carefully planned and organised clinical management and with the patients’ cooperation following informed consent.
Multidisciplinary teams, which can manage drug dependence, liver treatment and co-morbid mental problems, improve treatment outcomes (Grebely et al., 2007).
substitution treatment is available in all EU Member States, Croatia and Norway, but in several countries the provision of this intervention remains limited (see Chapters 2 and 6).
Data provided from 15 countries show that more than 125 000 persons have accessed agencies with needle and syringe programmes in 2007 (142).
Information on client access is, however, not available for four of the largest EU Member States (Germany, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom).
A national survey conducted in the 120 French ‘CAARUD’ harmreduction centres showed that they had been used by an estimated 40 000 individuals in 2007 (Toufik et al., 2008).
In the United Kingdom, a new needle exchange monitoring system was established in 2008.
Lowthreshold facilities can provide the opportunity to deliver primary health care services and harm reduction interventions to hard to reach populations.
A recent evaluation of lowthreshold health service centres targeting injecting drug users in Finland concluded that this combination of services had played a significant role in the prevention of infectious diseases.
It was also considered as a cost-effective innovation, capable of operating within the country’s restrictive drug policy (Arponen et al., 2008).
(140) Experts from 26 EU countries, Turkey and Norway rated the level of provision of selected interventions to drug users.(141)See Table HSR-5 (part i) and (part ii) in the 2009 statistical bulletin.
) See Table HSR-5 (part ii) in the 2009 statistical bulletin.
Training in health promotion, based on formal curricula or training handbooks, is offered to staff of needle and syringe programmes in 20 countries and to pharmacists in nine countries.
Guidelines for work in lowthreshold settings, which cover topics such as infectious disease testing, syringe exchange, outreach work and peer training, are also reported in 11 EU Member States.
Drugrelated mortality includes deaths that are directly caused by the pharmacological action of one or several substances (drug-induced deaths) and deaths that are indirectly caused by the use of drugs, often with other concurrent factors (e.g. accidents).
Known causes of deaths include acute toxicity, traffic accidents in particular when combined with alcohol (EMCDDA, 2007c), violence, suicide among already vulnerable people, or chronic conditions due to repeated use (e.g. cardiovascular problems in cocaine users).
While most drugrelated deaths occur among problem drug users, some occur among other groups of users, including those using drugs only occasionally (143).
Druginduced deaths
The EMCDDA definition of druginduced deaths refers to those deaths that are directly caused (overdoses) by the consumption of one or more drugs, of which at least one is an illicit drug.
The number of deaths can be influenced
Drug use is one of the major causes of health problems and death among young people in Europe.
This can be illustrated by an international study supported by the EMCDDA, which found that, in seven European urban areas, between 10 % and 23 % of mortality among those aged 15 to 49 could be attributed to opioid use (Bargagli et al., 2005).
Figure 13: Mortality rates among all adults (15–64 years) due to druginduced deaths
40 a te per million R
Factors associated with heroin overdoses include injection and simultaneous use of other substances, in particular alcohol, benzodiazepines and some antidepressants, as well as co-morbidity, having experienced previous overdoses and being alone (Scottish Government, 2008). The time immediately after release from prison or discharge from drug treatment was identified as a particularly high-risk period for overdoses.
During the period 1990–2006, between 6 400 and 8 500 druginduced deaths were reported each year by EU Member States, Croatia, Norway and Turkey, adding up to more than 135 000 deaths. In 2006, the United Kingdom and Germany accounted for half of all reported deaths.
Population mortality rates due to druginduced death vary widely between countries, ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15–64 years, with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe.
Rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries, and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries (Figure 13).
Among Europeans aged 15–39 years, drug overdose accounted for 4 % of all deaths (145).
Research shows that opioid substitution treatment reduces the risk of fatal overdose. A number of deaths showing the presence of substances used in substitution treatment (methadone or buprenorphine) are nevertheless reported each year, mostly due to misuse or, in a small number of cases, to problems occurring during treatment.
Deaths related to opioids
Opioids, mainly heroin or its metabolites, are present in the majority of druginduced deaths reported in Europe.
In the 22 countries providing data, opioids accounted for 35 % to almost 100 % of all cases, with 11 of these countries reporting proportions of over 85 % (146).
Other substances are also found in the toxicology reports in addition to heroin.
The most frequently reported are alcohol, benzodiazepines, other opioids and, in some countries, cocaine.
This suggests that a substantial proportion of all druginduced fatalities may be related to polydrug use.
In Finland, however, buprenorphine is now the most common substance detected in druginduced deaths, usually in combination with sedative medicines or alcohol, or taken by injection.
Men account for most heroin overdose deaths occurring in Europe (82 %).
In most countries the mean age of those dying from drug overdose is in the mid-thirties, and in many instances it is increasing, suggesting a possible stabilisation or decrease in the number of young heroin
An epidemic of fentanyl poisonings in Estonia caused the death of 117 injecting drug users in 2005/06 (EMCDDA, 2008b).
(144) For detailed methodological information see the 2009 statistical bulletin.(145) See Figure DRD-7 (part i) and Tables DRD-5 (part ii) and DRD-107 (part i) in the 2009 statistical bulletin.(146) As most cases reported to the EMCDDA are opioid overdoses (mainly heroin), general characteristics of reported druginduced deaths are used for description of opioid cases.
See Figure DRD-1 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.)
See Figures DRD-2 and DRD-3 and Table DRD-1 (part i) in the 2009 statistical bulletin.
Chapter 7: Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths instance, in the case of mortality related to HIV/AIDS, Eurostat and EuroHIV information is combined.
This suggests that the total mortality in this population could be around two to five times the number of registered druginduced deaths.
This multiplier varies across countries according to different factors, including risk behaviours, rate of fatal overdoses and prevalence of other possible causes of death.
Mortality cohort studies track the same groups of problem drug users over time and, through linkage with mortality registries, try to identify the causes of all deaths occurring in the group.
This type of study can determine overall and cause-specific mortality rates for the cohort, and can estimate the group’s excess mortality compared to the general population.
Large-scale longitudinal cohort studies can be used to test hypotheses about, for example, the reasons for changes in the numbers of druginduced deaths, as well as to monitor the overall risk and detect changing patterns in the causes of death.
In 2008, a project in collaboration with researchers from the Czech Republic reviewed the literature, data sources and possible methods in this field (1).
Both methods have been successfully pilot-tested in the Czech Republic, and the EMCDDA plans to set up a group of interested countries that could use this work in the near future.
Depending on recruitment settings (e.g. studies carried out in drug treatment facilities) and inclusion criteria (e.g. injecting drug users, heroin users), most cohort studies show mortality rates in the range of 1–2 % per year among problem drug users.
Although the relative importance of the causes of death varies between countries and over time, the main cause is generally drug overdose, accounting for up to 50–60 % of deaths among injectors in countries with low prevalence of HIV/AIDS.
To improve the validity of the description of causes of deaths other sources of information (i.e. special police or forensic mortality registries) can be consulted too.
France, Italy and Portugal. Following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996, HIV/AIDS mortality decreased markedly in most EU countries, although the decrease was much less pronounced in Portugal.
Increases observed in recent years in Estonia are consistent with the high estimates of HIV prevalence among injecting drug users in this country (5 to 6 out of 10) and the high proportion of them reportedly unaware of their infection.
Recent increases have also been reported in Latvia.
At present, estimated HIV/AIDS mortality rates among drug users are low in most countries, except in Spain and Portugal.
In Italy, France and Latvia, HIV/AIDS mortality and overdose mortality are of similar levels (153).
The EMCDDA has developed a protocol to encourage Member States to undertake mortality cohort studies, with the aim of providing comparable information about mortality risks in problem drug users and to inform prevention and care policies.
The most recent European studies were conducted in Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Norway. A third of the EU Member States have yet to carry out a mortality cohort study, though several countries report studies that are ongoing or planned for 2009 (e.g. Czech Republic, France, Latvia, Poland).
Deaths indirectly related to drug use
It can be estimated that in 2006, over 2 100 people died of HIV/AIDS attributable to drug use in the European
Other diseases that also account for a proportion of deaths among drug users include chronic conditions such as liver diseases (due to hepatitis C infection and heavy alcohol use), cancer and cardiovascular problems.
Other causes have received much less attention, despite indications that they have a considerable impact.
For instance, trauma (accidents, homicides and other violence) and suicide could account for 25 % or more of the mortality of problem drug users. A literature review

) The year 2006 was taken as the more recent year for which information from almost all Member States regarding causes of death is available through Eurostat.

See Figure DRD-7 (part ii) in the 2009 statistical bulletin.
Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
In recent cohort studies in Europe, suicide accounted for 6 % to 11 % of deaths among problem drug users. However, the overall impact of these causes is difficult to assess due to the limited availability of data.
Reducing drugrelated deaths families of drug users to recognise and manage drug overdoses; in eight countries, such materials are available for police officers; and in seven countries, they have been developed for prison staff (155).
Other target groups include workers of drugs agencies, ambulance personnel, accident and emergency staff, as well as immigrants from Russian-speaking countries and the Roma population. The number of countries where materials for several target groups are available, however, is limited, and not all materials are accessible nationwide.
Education about overdose risk is reported by all countries, and in nine of them it exists in most relevant cities with a significant number of problem drug users.
However, in four countries, such activities take place only in a minority of relevant cities, and in a further 12 countries in just a few cities.
Twelve countries report that their national drug strategy includes a part dedicated to the reduction of druginduced deaths.
One country, the United Kingdom, has a specific action plan to reduce drugrelated harm, which sets out specific actions for the prevention of drugrelated deaths.
Thirteen countries have neither a specific strategy or a section of the national drug strategy dedicated to the reduction of druginduced deaths, and two countries reported no information.
Drug users are informed about overdose risks, including decreased tolerance after periods of abstinence, the effects and risks of polydrug use, in particular concomitant alcohol use, risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid.
It is estimated by national experts that in seven countries a majority of problem drug users received some overdose response training in the last 12 months, while in 10 countries only a minority received it, and in a further six countries (Belgium, Latvia, Austria, Poland, Romania, Slovakia) only a few problem drug users received this type of instruction.
Overdose response training is not available in Estonia, Hungary and Turkey.
A prospective long-term study among problem drug users entering treatment in Italy showed that the risk of death among the cohort was, compared to the general population, increased by a factor of 10 (Davoli et al., 2007).
Being in treatment lowered the risk of death to four times that of the general population, confirming thereby that drug treatment reduces drugrelated mortality.
However, the study also showed that the highest mortality rate among drug users was observed in the 30 days after cessation of treatment.
This finding highlights the need for careful after-care management, as well as the avoidance of very short treatment episodes, where risks could outweigh the benefits of treatment.
Drug users with previous experience of nonfatal overdose are at high risk of experiencing future overdoses (Coffin et al., 2007) and should be specifically targeted.
Individual overdose risk assessments are conducted by trained staff, and aim at identifying those in need of additional support.
According to experts, in nine countries most problem drug users received an overdose risk assessment at least once during the last year, while in 16 countries only a minority received this type of intervention.
No information is available from Bulgaria, Germany and France.
The provision of awareness raising and prevention materials is reported from most countries for which information is available.
According to experts from 28 countries (154), printed or multi-media overdose prevention materials for drug users have been provided during the last year to most or nearly all problem drug users in nine countries, and to a minority of them in 12 countries and in the French Community in Belgium.
Such materials do not exist in Turkey, and few problem drug users have access to them in Estonia, Latvia, Hungary and Slovakia.
No information is available from Bulgaria.
A large proportion of fatal and nonfatal drug overdoses are witnessed by others, including drug users’ peers or family members, health and social staff, police or prison guards, who would be in a position to intervene.
The provision of naloxone to users is not a standard approach in overdose prevention throughout Europe, though the distribution of take-home supplies is common in drugs services in Italy, where they may also be purchased in pharmacies without prescription.
In the United Kingdom, the legal status of naloxone was changed in June 2005, permitting its administration by any member of the public in life-saving circumstances.
Experts from 26 EU countries, Turkey and Norway rated the level of provision of selected interventions to prevent drugrelated deaths.)
See Table HSR-8 (part ii) in the 2009 statistical bulletin.
Reducing overdose deaths after prison
In England, it has been estimated that 15 % of the 1 506 drug overdose deaths in 2005 occurred in people recently released from prison (Department of Health, 2007).
International studies confirm this elevated risk of death due to unintentional drug overdose in the time immediately after release from prison (e.g. Farrell and Marsden, 2008).
supply was assessed in a cohort study with 239 opioid users recruited from treatment services (Strang et al., 2008). Results show improved knowledge of signs of overdose and increased confidence of using naloxone.
During the first 3 months, all 12 overdoses where naloxone was used had been reversed successfully, while one death had occurred in the six overdoses in which it was not used.
The authors conclude that wider provision may reduce drugrelated deaths further and recommend additional studies of the impact of overdose training and emergency naloxone-supply among opioid users.
According to expert ratings from 24 countries, prison pre-release counselling on overdose risk and prevention is currently not provided in six European countries, only provided to a few problem drug users in prison in 10 countries, and to less than half of them in a further six countries.
Only Italy and Luxembourg provide this service to the majority of the target population.
As the day of release may be difficult to predict, especially for remand prisoners, overdose risk awareness education should ideally be offered on a regular basis in prisons to reduce risk behaviours.
Another controversial approach is the provision of supervised drug consumption facilities (156), which aim to reduce the risk of death for their clients by providing prompt and appropriate medical attention in the event of an on-site overdose.
Operational data from such facilities in Europe, Canada and Australia indicate that drug overdoses that occur in the facility are successfully managed, with no reported fatal overdoses.
Milloy and colleagues calculated the number of deaths potentially averted by the operation of the drug consumption facility in Vancouver.
They estimated that between two and 12 deaths a year may have been averted (Milloy et al., 2008).
This confirms earlier findings regarding the likely beneficial effect of these facilities on overdose deaths in neighbourhoods where coverage is sufficient.
Opioid substitution treatment, which has shown a protective effect in the prison context (Dolan et al., 2005), appears to be becoming more available in prisons in the EU, and the legal option to initiate substitution treatment in prison exists in 21 countries (see Chapter 2).
The opportunity to start this type of treatment in prison reduces the risk of overdose and death on leaving prison, and reduces reincarceration rates (WHO, 2009).
It is, however, important that prison health services and communitybased treatment providers are appropriately linked to avoid any gaps in the continuity of treatment.
Chapter 8New drugs and emerging trends
During 2008, 13 new psychoactive substances were officially notified for the first time in the EU through the early-warning system.
Besides new synthetic drugs, which accounted for 11 of the newly notified substances, the group included two plants, but no medicinal products.
The chemical make-up of the two plants reported — kratom and kava — is relatively well known from the literature.
They have been traditionally used in other parts of the world and their presence on the European drug scene seems to be limited.
The use of new psychoactive substances and new patterns of drug use can have important public health and policy implications.
They are, however, difficult to detect because, typically, they first emerge at low levels and in specific localities or among restricted subgroups of the population.
Few countries have monitoring systems that are sensitive to new phenomena in the drug field, and methodological difficulties to detect them are considerable.
Nonetheless, the importance of identifying potential new threats is widely recognised.
The European Union’s early-warning system provides a quick-response mechanism to the emergence of new psychoactive substances on the drug scene.
Activities in support of the early-warning system form an important part of the work of the EMCDDA and fit within a broader perspective of using a wide variety of data sources to improve the timeliness and sensitivity of the European drug monitoring system.
Most of the newly reported synthetic compounds are psychotropic substances similar to those listed in Schedules I and II of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
Of the new substances reported in 2008, compared with previous years, fewer belong to the main chemical groups — phenethylamines (one), tryptamines (two) and piperazines (none).
Notably, six of the newly notified substances are cathinone derivatives.
Most of the new synthetic substances have stimulant properties, while only three produce hallucinogenic effects.
) establishes a mechanism for the rapid exchange of information on new psychoactive substances that may pose public health and social threats (the early-warning system) (158
More than 90 substances have been reported through the early-warning system since its establishment in 1997.
Until recently, phenethylamines and tryptamines accounted for a large proportion of notifications.
However, in the past few years, a much more diverse range of substances has appeared.
Included among these are numerous piperazine and cathinone derivatives, as well as a heterogeneous mix of other substances, including plant products, a few
The appearance of synthetic cannabinoids marks the latest stage in the development of ‘designer drugs’: from those based on fentanyl in the 1980s; to ring-substituted phenethylamines in the late 1980s and tryptamines in 1990s; to piperazines and cathinone derivatives in the 2000s.

Products of five psychoactive plants have been reported in recent years.
The species detected by the early-warning system are not under international control, but may be controlled by EU Member States.
doses, kratom has opioid-like effects, and has been used in traditional medicine to treat pain and opioid withdrawal.
The main active principles of kratom are mitragynine, mitraphylline and 7-hydroxymitragynine; though mitragynine is probably responsible for kratom’s analgesic activity and for relieving the opioid withdrawal symptoms.
The plant, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are controlled in Denmark, while Lithuania controls the plant and mitragynine.
Kava (Piper methysticum) is a shrub that has been used for centuries in the South Pacific Islands for ceremonial purposes.
A tea brewed from the roots of the plant can be taken for its anti-anxiety and relaxant effects.
Concern has been growing that long-term use of kava can cause liver damage.
Neither the plant or its active principles (kavalactones) are reported to be controlled in any EU Member State.
Salvia divinorum is a perennial herb native to southern Mexico, where due to its hallucinogenic properties it is traditionally used for ceremonial purposes.
The main active principle, salvinorin-A, is a potent kappa opioid receptor agonist.
Recreational modes of use of Salvia include chewing the leaves, and smoking or sublingual administration of concentrated extracts, which appear to produce intense effects.
Ingestion of the leaves or seeds of the plant produces a longer-lasting, but less intense effect.
Salvia divinorum or its active principles are controlled in six Member States and Croatia.
Khat is comprised of leaves and fresh shoots of Catha edulis, a shrub cultivated in East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.
It is used as a mild stimulant by chewing the fresh vegetable matter.
The active components, cathinone and cathin, are close chemical relatives of synthetic drugs such as amphetamine and methcathinone, and are internationally controlled under the 1971 UN Convention.
Catha edulis is controlled in 12 EU Member States.
Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tree native to southeast Asia.
The leaves can be chewed, smoked or brewed into a tea.
At low doses, it has stimulant effects.
Its seeds contain the active principle d-lysergic acid amide (LSA, also known as d-lysergamide), a substance closely related to LSD, and can produce mild hallucinogenic effects.
LSA is controlled as a drug in Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Products marketed on the Internet and in some specialised shops under the name ‘spice’ have been available since at least 2006. Although ‘spice’ may be advertised as incense, when smoked the effects are described by some users as similar to those of cannabis.
Following a report from Sweden, the early-warning system has been monitoring ‘spice’ products since the beginning of 2008.
The chemical structure of JWH-018 differs substantially from that of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active principle in all cannabis products.
In experimental animals, JWH-018 produces the same effects as THC, and has been reported to be more potent.
Early in 2009, a second synthetic cannabinoid, CP 47,497 (160), and three of its homologues were detected in ‘spice’ samples in Europe.
Synthetic cannabinoids have been identified only in a limited number of samples, and in varying amounts.
It would appear that these synthetic substances have been added surreptitiously, as packaging information on ‘spice’ products only mentions herbal ingredients.
Packaging information on ‘spice’ products indicates that they are composed of as many as 14 ingredients of plant origin.
While at least two of the ingredients — Pedicularis densiflora and Leonotis leonurus — may have some psychoactive effect, little is known about the pharmacology and toxicology of the plant materials purportedly contained in ‘spice’ products.
Thus, no definite statements can be made as to the potential health risks or possible psychoactive effects of these products.
Synthetic ingredients are not mentioned in the product information.
The substances JWH-018 and CP 47,497 and its homologues are not known to have been widely used as psychoactive drugs, in their own rights.
Therefore, it is still to be established if a specific demand for these particular substances exists, and if there is a need for further action as stipulated by Council Decision 2005/387/JHA.
National risk assessment procedures possibility of offering for sale alternatives to controlled drugs to a large public.
The online marketplace has implications for the potential spread of new psychoactive substances, and monitoring it is an increasingly important element of identifying new drug trends.
In particular, it is necessary to focus on the risks associated with the substances offered for sale.
Information about new products is needed by both the users and professionals, including clinical toxicologists, poison control specialists and those working in the drugs field.
In 2008, the EMCDDA conducted a study of the different national legal procedures involved in putting new substances under the control of the drugs legislation, the time taken for such a procedure, and whether any national risk assessment procedure would be involved.
Across the 26 countries studied, three distinct approaches to risk assessment are apparent.
In six countries, national risk assessment is not carried out.
Generally, these countries rely on risk assessments carried out at international or European level.
In seven countries, national risk assessment may be carried out on an ad-hoc basis, when necessary.
And, in 13 countries, a form of risk assessment will be undertaken when considering whether to control a substance, either mandated by the drug law or equivalent or as part of the required procedure for proposing any new legislation.
To identify current developments in the online drug market, the EMCDDA conducts an annual snapshot study.
In 2009, a total of 115 online shops were surveyed.
Based on the country code domains and other information on the websites, these online shops appear to be located in 17 European countries.
The majority of online retailers identified were based in the United Kingdom (37 %), Germany (15 %), Netherlands (14 %) and Romania (7 %).
Hallucinogenic mushrooms containing psilocin and psilocybin were not offered for sale in any of the online shops surveyed in 2009, unlike 2008.
However, four online retailers based in France and the Netherlands offered scelerotia — the hardened mycelium of the hallucinogenic mushrooms Psilocybe mexicana and Psilocybe tampanensis.
In 16 countries, national risk assessments are carried out by a group of experts within the public administration, either a competent ministry or a state or governmental agency.
Six countries do or might provide for the possibility of consultation with independent scientists, if a need is perceived.
And, in three countries (Netherlands, Austria, United Kingdom), risk assessment is performed by independent scientific bodies.
New products offered for sale in 2009 include a range of herbal smoking products and ‘party pills’ containing new legal alternatives to benzylpiperazine (BZP).
There has also been an increasing focus on snuff products or herbal powders.
See ELDD Legal reports for further information (http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu).
‘Spice’ products (161) were offered for sale by 48 % of the retailers surveyed.
While the online shops selling ‘spice’ were based in 14 different European countries, more than two fifths of these shops were located in the United Kingdom (42 %), with significant numbers also in Ireland, Latvia and Romania.
Concern about ‘spice’ products has led to a number of countries taking legal action to ban or otherwise control these substances.
By March 2009, ‘spice’ products had been withdrawn from online shops based in Germany, Austria and France.
otherwise control ‘spice’ products and related compounds. Germany used emergency narcotics legislation to control five synthetic cannabinoids found in ‘spice’ for 1 year.
Austria used its medicines act to prohibit smoking mixes containing six synthetic cannabinoids from being imported or marketed in the country.
Luxembourg decided to control various synthetic cannabinoids as psychotropic substances. Poland amended the narcotic law, placing under control JWH-018 and two of the claimed herbal ingredients of ‘spice’.
Internet: a marketplace for psychoactive substances
The Internet has emerged as a new marketplace for psychoactive substances, providing retailers with the
In 2009, alternative smoking blends to ‘spice’ started to appear on the online marketplace.
The retailers surveyed offered for sale at least 27 different herbal smoking blends as alternatives to ‘spice’.
These products are advertised as containing plant-based ingredients, though some also contain the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria.

17 Member States (163) have reported that they have controlled BZP.
Since BZP became subject to control measures in EU Member States, this substance may no longer be used in ‘party pills’ sold as legal alternatives to ecstasy.
At the beginning of 2009, many online retailers were offering BZP-free ‘party pills’.
For example, online shops based in Ireland, Poland and the United Kingdom were offering ‘retro pills’, which are purported to contain 1-(4-fluorophenyl) piperazine (pFPP), a substance described as having mild hallucinogenic and strong euphoric effects.
Snuff products are marketed as an alternative to controlled drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines.
The products are purported to contain caffeine and a range of other plant-based ingredients such as Acorus calamus, Hydrastis canadensis and Tilia europea.
Follow-up on substances
Few countries report prevalence data on GHB and ketamine, and the prevalence estimates that are reported remain at much lower levels than for other illicit drugs.
Changes in the situation are difficult to assess due to prevalence data being obtained from non-probabilistic samples with limited comparability over time and between samples.
The Dutch ‘Trendwatch’ study reported a slight increase in the use of GHB in specific networks and regions in the Netherlands in 2007, but both GHB and ketamine are used less often than other party drugs and mostly in hidden populations, at home and at parties.
In contrast to increases reported in previous years, the latest statistics on medical emergencies related to GHB in Amsterdam indicate a marked decline, from 444 cases in 2006 to 110 in 2007.
A study carried out at a London hospital reported 58 emergencies related to ketamine use in 2006, and the same number in 2007.
In most of the ketamine-related presentations, the drug was co-ingested with other drugs, with only 11 % involving ketamine on its own, and none of these required admission to critical care (Wood et al., 2008).
In 2007, the EMCDDA–Europol active monitoring report on mCPP (1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine) concluded that it has no particular appeal to users and seems unlikely to establish itself as a recreational drug in its own right.
In 2008, however, mCPP continued to be the most widely available new synthetic drug on the illicit drug market, encountered alone or in combination with MDMA.
This is evidenced both by the number of seizures and the amount of seized material reported to the EMCDDA and Europol.
It is still unclear if the substance is used to enhance or mimic some of the effects of MDMA or simply as a ‘cutting agent’.
However, as mCPP is not a controlled substance in most Member States, it is likely that seizures are under-reported.
On 3 March 2008, the Council decided that Member States shall take the necessary measures, in accordance with their national law, to submit BZP to control measures proportionate to the risks of the substance, and criminal
The ESPAD school population surveys carried out in 2007 provide the most recent data on GHB use among 15- to 16-year-old school students across Europe.
Among the school students surveyed in 26 EU countries plus Norway and Croatia, lifetime prevalence of GHB use ranges from zero to 3 %, though most countries report a level of 1 % or less.

Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is one of the European Union’s decentralised agencies.
Established in 1993 and based in Lisbon, it is the central source of comprehensive information on drugs and drug addiction in Europe.
The EMCDDA collects, analyses and disseminates factual, objective, reliable and comparable information on drugs and drug addiction.
In doing so, it provides its audiences with an evidence-based picture of the drug phenomenon at European level.
The Centre’s publications are a prime source of information for a wide range of audiences including policymakers and their advisers; professionals and researchers working in the field of drugs; and, more broadly, the media and general public.
The annual report presents the EMCDDA’s yearly overview of the drug phenomenon in the EU and is an essential reference book for those seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe.
Briefing of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
Drugs and crime — a complex relationship
EN C of drug use and problem drug users are frequently found to be offenders.
However, the relationship between drugs and crime is neither simple nor linear.
Nor is it universal: many repeat offenders are not involved in drug use and many dependent drug users do not commit any crimes (other than drug use/possession, where it is criminalised).
demonstration of wealth and status.
And some may go on to become more regular or dependent drug users, which can in turn lead to their increased involvement in crime or the drug market.
Thus, a mutual reinforcement effect between criminal involvement and drug use can exist, with those involved in a deviant criminal subculture being at elevated risk of developing drug problems and those with drug problems being at elevated risk of becoming involved in criminal acts.
The need to prevent drug-related crime is high on the European policy agenda, as illustrated by the fact that the current EU drug strategy identifies this objective as a key area of action for achieving its aim of ensuring a high level of security for the general public.
However, a necessary prerequisite to discussion on the extent of this problem and for considering the impact of interventions is an agreed conceptual framework for describing the problem.
This is also recognised in the current EU drugs action plan (2005–08), where the development of a common definition of drug-related crime is an explicit action.
In this policy briefing the different types of offences that might be encompassed under a general heading of drug-related crime are explored.
Although studies do not show any strong link between experimental drug use and offending, they do tend to show that delinquency often precedes involvement with illicit drugs.
This is especially true for those drugs particularly associated with dependence and problems, such as heroin or crack cocaine.
Studies have also shown that dependent drug users may commit acquisitive crimes as a means of supporting their drug habits.
For the career criminal, drugs may form part of the deviant lifestyle, with spending on drugs being a
Studies have revealed various risk factors (some common, some not) for involvement in offending and in drug use.
It has been proposed that the extent to which individuals adopt a deviant lifestyle may affect the various factors (substance-related, individual, social, cultural and environmental) that determine whether offending and drug use continues, progresses or ceases during the course of an individual’s life.
The term ‘drugrelated crime’ is used here to encompass four types of crimes.
Economiccompulsive crimes: crimes committed in order to obtain money (or drugs) to support drug use.
Systemic crimes: crimes committed within the functioning of illicit drug markets, as part of the business of drug supply, distribution and use.
Drug law offences: crimes committed in violation of drug (and other related) legislations.
Key issues at a glance
There is a great deal of variation in what is meant by ‘drugrelated crime’ across disciplines and professionals; a definition encompassing four categories is suggested here as an aid to conceptualising this issue.
Violations of drug laws account for a significant proportion of law enforcement and criminal justice resources and, by drawing resources away from other areas, may impact on the commission of other crimes.
Although psychopharmacological violence is most strongly associated with alcohol use, illicit drug use, and particularly the use of stimulants, may lead to criminal behaviour by exacerbating existing psychopathological and social problems, or by increasing the risk of paranoid or psychotic episodes.
Economically motivated crimes have often been considered an inherent consequence of drug dependence, and a reduction in such crimes is usually seen as a measure of success for many interventions targeting dependent drug users.
The few attempts that have been made to assess the extent of and trends in drug-related crime at national level show that many issues and challenges (conceptual and methodological) are inherent in such an exercise.
Defining drug-related crime to assess its extent and patterns
A definition of drug-related crime
‘The need to reduce drug-related crime is now recognised as an important policy objective in Europe.
Adopting a clear definition of drug-related crime is an essential first step if we are to develop the methodologies needed to assess not only the true extent of this problem, but also the impact of our policies and actions.’
Marcel Reimen, Chairman, EMCDDA Management Board psychotic episodes of behaviour and may well exacerbate existing behavioural problems.
That said, no psychoactive substance can be said to have universal criminogenic properties and both individual and environmental factors can influence how the use of psychoactive substances impacts on behaviour.
The effects of such drugs include excitability, irritability, fear/paranoia, disinhibition, drastic mood swings, cognitive distortions and impaired judgement, any of which may lead to criminal behaviour.
It is also important to include in this category crimes induced by the victim’s own drug use. Such crimes are less visible, because many go unreported.
Thus, psychopharmacological crimes should also include crimes such as sexual assault committed while the victim is under the influence of alcohol or other psychoactive substances, but also robbery or mugging that is made possible because of the victim’s incapacitation and fights instigated under the influence of drugs.
However, such a definition of drug-related crime is essential to any attempt to assess its extent, patterns and trends.
In practice, each model is sometimes valid and can be applied to some subgroups of the population of drug-using offenders or to some types of drug-related crime.
It is important to remember that the relationship between drugs and crime can be a dynamic one and may vary even in the same person over time.
Dependence on an expensive substance can lead users to engage in criminal acts to obtain the money they use to fund their drug habit.
They may resort to both consensual crimes, such as drug selling or prostitution (where criminalised), and acquisitive crimes (e.g. shoplifting, robbery, burglary).
Such offenders are sometimes paid in drugs.
This category of drug-related crime also includes the forging of prescriptions and the burgling of pharmacies by drug users, both of which provide medicines that can be used as substitutes for illicit products.
Much of the existing research supports the view that there is a strong association between alcohol intoxication and psychopharmacologically induced crime, especially violence.
Following a long way behind alcohol in this regard are the stimulants — cocaine/crack and amphetamines.
The use of opiates and cannabis is usually considered to be unlikely to lead to psychopharmacologically induced crime, and may even contribute to reducing it in some individuals, as these drugs (and tranquillisers) tend to reduce violent impulses and aggression.
However, irritability associated with the withdrawal syndrome, as well as related mental health problems, may be linked to increased violence.
Although many acquisitive crimes committed by drug users are opportunistic, some require more skill and others involve some specialisation.
For example, fraud and embezzlement are white-collar crimes that require a specific professional environment.
While the term ‘compulsive’ suggests that a state of dependence is necessary, offenders in this category include all
While the pharmacology of most illicit drugs is well known, the specific mechanisms through which they promote violent behaviours are not fully understood although some substances, usually stimulants, are known to produce
An increasingly common approach in empirical studies has been to apply the tripartite conceptual framework proposed by Goldstein for the relationship between drugs and crime.
In this model, drugs lead to violence through an integration of the psychopharmacological, economiccompulsive and systemic models.
Although it may not encompass all the possible relationships between drugs and crime, this approach does provide a useful conceptual framework for the analysis of drug-related crime.
Additionally, from a policy perspective, it is helpful to include a legal definition model, in which crimes against drug laws are considered to be another type of drug-related crime.
The resulting conceptual model, composed of four categories of drug crimes, is the basis for the definition of the term ‘drugrelated crime’ used here, the individual components of which are discussed below.
Drug law offences
Many studies have been carried out on the links between drug use/traffi cking and crime, mostly in the United States.
Typically studies have looked at offending patterns in captive populations, such as those in drug treatment or arrestees and therefore provide a restricted view of the complex relationships between drugs and crime in a total population.
those whose drug use needs to be supported by illegal income, which will be determined by their type and pattern of substance use, socioeconomic situation and extent of deviant lifestyle.
Indeed, not all those who are dependent on expensive drugs commit economic crime — they may regulate their use according to their financial resources and drug prices, attempt to increase their legitimate income (social benefits, employment, pawning goods) or avoid expenditures by maximising income ‘in kind’ (accommodation, meals, etc.).
Many drug users utilise a combination of all these means.
Violations of drug-related legislation may include drug law offences such as drug use, possession, cultivation, production, importation and trafficking, but also other related offences such as the illicit manufacture and trafficking of precursors or money laundering.
Drug driving (driving under the influence of drugs) offences are also included in this category of drug-related crime.
Estimating the true total volume of any type of crime, the ‘dark figure’, based on the fraction that is reported, is always difficult, and this is especially the case for drug-related crime. With the obvious exception of drug law offences, whether or not a reported crime can be reasonably considered drug-related is neither assessed nor recorded, making official statistics on crime of limited value in estimating the size of the drug-related crime problem when taken on their own.
However, some studies have attempted to estimate the proportion of different types of offence that are drug-related and then apply this fraction to produce overall estimates of drug-related crime.
Systemic criminality refers mainly to violent acts (e.g. assaults, homicides) committed within the functioning of illicit drug markets, as part of the business of drug supply, distribution and use.
Violence as a strategy of control is used in various situations including territorial disputes, punishment for fraud, debt collection and clashes with the police.
In drug production and transit countries where the rule of law is challenged, systemic crimes may also encompass, for example, corruption of businesses, governments and banking systems or crimes against humanity by drug traffickers. ckers.
Studies of drug-related crime have often overlooked drug law offences as the link between drugs and crime is of a very different nature — in this case drugs and crime are linked by definition in the law, rather than by any effect of one behaviour on the other.
Such offences are indeed intrinsically dependent on the prohibition of a set of psychoactive substances. However, it is important to consider the illicit status of these drugs as it is a factor in drug market violence and may exacerbate economically motivated offending by increasing drug prices.
In addition, drug law offences account for a substantial share of law enforcement and criminal justice system activities and resources.
It is especially difficult to determine the nature of the link between drugs and crime, and particularly whether one behaviour is sufficient for the other to occur (a strict causal relationship) or merely necessary (a weak causal relation).
However, it is important in any study of drugs and crime to distinguish between a causal link between the two behaviours in terms of overall life pathway (linked to temporal order) and one that pertains only to the specific situation in which a crime is committed.
Systemic violence is linked to prohibition as it stems mainly from the illicit nature of a market characterised by huge profits and whose participants cannot resort to standard business law.
There is no intrinsic connection with drug use, and it is less clear in general whether drugs (trafficking and use) lead to systemic crime or the reverse, or even whether they are just part of the same general lifestyle.
However, the pervasiveness of violence in drug markets may increase the likelihood of drug users becoming perpetrators or victims of violent crimes.
The four categories of drug-related crime suggested, and the models on which they are derived, are not mutually exclusive.
Both the models and the categories of crime can overlap, as can the populations to which they refer.
Rather, the categorisation should be considered to demonstrate ‘ideal types’ that allow drug-related crime to be conceptualised and facilitate comparisons.
Indeed, from an economic perspective, which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives, any increase in the proportion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes.
This would make such crimes relatively less costly (through reduced probability of arrest and shortened incarceration) and therefore may increase their incidence.

An estimated 12 million (3.5 %) European adults aged 15–64 have tried cocaine and 4.5 million (1.3 %) have used it in the last year.
Overall, cocaine supply, use and related problems in Europe have risen over the last decade, and prices have dropped.
However, this overall trend masks considerable inter-country variation.
Some countries, such as the UK, Spain and Italy, have seen considerable increases in cocaine use while

Cocaine is the hydrochloride salt produced from the leaves of the coca plant (Erythroxylon coca Lam) which is cultivated mainly in South America.
Powder cocaine is typically snorted (insufflated) and, less frequently, injected.
It produces euphoria and appetite suppression, and has multiple negative effects on health (see ‘Health issues’).
Crack is the smokable form of cocaine and is manufactured from cocaine hydrochloride.
It is known for immediate effects and association with problematic patterns of use.
Key issues at a glance
Some 4.5 million European adults (1.3 %) have used cocaine in the last year.
Last year cocaine prevalence has shown an overall upward trend over the last decade, although with variations between EU Member States, ranging from 0.1 % to 3.0 % of the population.
Cocaine use can lead to dependence and treatment demand related to cocaine has increased.
Psychiatric, cardiovascular and other health problems are also associated with cocaine use.
Injecting cocaine carries the risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.
Three core groups of problem cocaine users can be identified: socially well-integrated individuals; opioid users, some of whom are substitution treatment clients; and marginalised crack users.

Second only to cannabis, cocaine is among the most trafficked drugs in the world.
In 2005, an estimated 752 tonnes were seized worldwide and 107 tonnes in Europe, with Spain accounting for about half of European seizures.
Overall, the quantities seized and the number of seizures have increased in Europe since 2000, reaching around 70 000 cases in 2005.
Average prices of cocaine have fallen in most reporting countries.
Source: EMCDDA Statistical bulletin, figure GPS-38.
General population surveys show an increase in cocaine use in many EU countries, although this may now be slowing down in some Member States with the highest prevalence (UK, Spain).
Cocaine use is more common among young adults aged 15–34 (Figure 1) and males.
The drug is often consumed alongside other illicit drugs and alcohol.
Acute and chronic cocaine use, often in combination with other substances, can cause multiple disorders (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, neurological, psychiatric, etc.).
Cocaine injection also carries the risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C. Acute cocaine-related deaths from overdose are not frequently reported, but in such rare cases a massive exposure is mentioned.
Most reported cocaine deaths are the consequence of its chronic toxicity, leading to cardiovascular and neurological complications.
Cocaine use has been shown to have negative effects on health, especially among frequent users.
However, the extent of both the morbidity and mortality related directly to cocaine use remains difficult to estimate.
The first group uses powder cocaine alone or in combination with cannabis and/or alcohol.
This group is mainly composed of males, often referred to treatment by the criminal justice system or under the pressure of social and family networks.
Different groups of users
Cocaine users are spread across diverse social groups.
For example, surveys in recreational nightlife settings show prevalence rates 5 to 20 times higher among clubbers than among
The second group uses both opioids and cocaine.
Its members are current or former heroin users who have also developed problems related to cocaine use. Some may be

It is the third most commonly reported drug cited as the reason for entering drug treatment in the EU, with about 13 % of all treatment demands in 2005.
However, there are considerable variations between countries.
In Spain and the Netherlands, cocaine accounts for respectively 40 % and 35 % of all treatment demands while this figure is 0 % in Finland and 0.1 % in Lithuania.

They might seek treatment and support at a later stage of their dependence and thus be more difficult to treat.
undergoing substitution treatment. National studies focusing on cocaine users in treatment report that this group is often the largest.
The way forward
Policies and interventions
At policy level, strategies for cocaine- or crack cocaine-only services should be developed where the extent of the problem merits a concerted and intensive response, for example in some European countries and cities.
Outside such locations, drug policies should address the growing diversity in drug use patterns and needs of problem drug users.
The third group uses crack cocaine, often in combination with opioids.
Its members are frequently highly marginalised, and may comprise a high proportion of ethnic minority members and people who are homeless, unemployed or in precarious labour conditions.
It is the smallest of the three groups (2.5 % of all European clients in treatment) and has only been identified in a few locations.
The needs of different user groups
There are very few drug strategies which specifically target cocaine and crack cocaine use and only the UK and Ireland have implemented strategies at national and/or local level.
Most European countries report that cocaine users can access information about cocaine and the risks of cocaine use through various sources such as websites, helplines and interventions in the nightlife setting.
In some cities, especially those with significant crack cocaine use, harm-reduction agencies also provide outreach interventions.
Cocaine and crack users represent a heterogeneous population with specific needs which may require tailored services.
Socially integrated powder cocaine users may need to be better informed about cocaine-related risks.
They may also be reluctant to initiate or continue treatment among marginalised drug users and feel there is a stigma attached to users attending such services.
Currently, most reported cocaine treatment in Europe takes place in outpatient settings which are primarily oriented to the needs of opioid users.
However, socially integrated cocaine users are likely to seek help through other healthcare providers such as general practitioners or private clinics.
There is a growing interest for countries with significant cocaineusing populations to provide services tailored specifically to cocaine users.
The treatment of cocaine dependence relies mainly on psychosocial interventions, with pharmacological agents being used as a support by many clinicians.
However, until now, no effective pharmacological agent has emerged to manage cocaine abstinence and reduce craving.
Therefore, research and training in psychosocial interventions should be given highest priority.
The exchange of experiences and best practice among clinicians should be encouraged.
Research on pharmaceutical agents should also be supported and the results made rapidly available, both for positive as well as negative outcomes.
Finally, cocaine users who are undergoing opioid substitution treatment should be assessed to make sure that their cocaine use is not linked with too low a dosage of methadone or buprenorphine.
Among dependent cocaine users who are also heroin users and/or in substitution, continued cocaine use may, if not addressed properly, interfere with the treatment programme and subsequently jeopardise the overall treatment outcome.
Similarly, co-use of alcohol and often observed co-morbid psychiatric and personality disorders in cocaine clients (e.g. aggression, acute psychosis and paranoid behaviour) constitute major problems for staff and clinicians.
The co-use of multiple substances also substantially increases the risk of additional health problems and the risk of death among this population.
Finally, crack cocaine often affects marginalised and deprived populations (e.g. the homeless, sex workers).
A recent EMCDDA review of the literature on the treatment of cocaine dependence found that no effective pharmacological therapeutic agent is yet available but that recent experimental trials (e.g. Topiramate, cocaine vaccines) have shown promising first results.
Cognitive behavioural interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational interviewing, and a community reinforcement approach sometimes combined with contingency management (e.g. voucher-based incentives), have been shown to be most effective in reducing and preventing future cocaine use.
However, as these approaches and the research about their effectiveness come almost exclusively from the
Interventions to reach socially integrated problem cocaine users and marginalised crack users also pose a challenge.
A recent Irish pilot project revealed that cocaine users’ reluctance to attend opioid-oriented programmes could be circumvented by providing special access during evenings, or immediately before and after the weekend.
For crack users and marginalised populations of drug users, harm reduction outreach interventions, combined with service referral, need to be given higher priority.

Neurobiological research on drugs: ethical and policyimplications
Drug addiction is a behaviour characterised by the individual exhibiting a loss of control over their consumption. Addicts may wish to stop, but find it difficult to do so, despite often experiencing negative consequences.
Modern developments in neurobiology help us to better understand this process.
Moreover, such developments now provide strong scientific grounds for viewing drug addiction as a psychiatric disorder, usually classified as a ‘chronic and relapsing brain disease’.
psychological and pharmacological treatments and prevention strategies. The findings so far are encouraging, but their implications can easily be overstated or misunderstood, and also raise a number of important ethical issues that require careful consideration.
This paper provides a summary of the key developments in this area and underlines the fact that any potential new approaches will require rigorous evaluation for safety and efficacy before being introduced into routine practice.
Most neurobiological research on addiction has focused on the role a drug-released neurotransmitter called dopamine has on the repeated activation of the ‘reward system’– circuitry made up of a complex set of cerebral structures which act as a barometer, indicating a person’s physical and psychological state.
Spurred on by recent technological developments occurring rapidly in this field, newmodels have arisen which take into account the implication of other neurotransmitters in the process, also exploring the role of genetic differences between individuals.
By providing a better understanding of how addiction develops, this research may provide the basis for new
Neurotransmitter: a chemical produced and released by neurons.
Some of these molecules (GABA, glutamic acid) participate in the communication between neurons; some others (dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin) modulate (amplify or attenuate) the information.
Reward system: this brain circuit reinforces behaviour when activated.
Data indicate that drugs of abuse are pleasurable because they activate this system.
Neurobiological research tries to understand how addictive drugs produce neurochemical changes in the brain’s reward pathway, making their use appealing and producing a drive to use them repeatedly.
A growing body of research suggests that chronic drug use can produce long-term disruptions in the modulation of neurocognitive circuits involved in motivation and attention, decision-making and the ability to inhibit impulses.
Neuroscience and genetic research promise to provide a detailed causal explanation in terms of brain processes.
However, causal, or over-simplified models of addiction could also potentially lead to more coercive policies towards addicted individuals, the neglect of important social policies, or undermine support for existing proven approaches to drug treatment.
There is a pressing need to explore the ethical and policyimplications of addiction neuroscience research to ensure that developments are taken forward in ways that adequately safeguard human rights and protect the ethical values of consent, liberty, equality and privacy.
Neuroimaging and genetic technologies may help to define more precisely intimate mechanisms of addiction and to identify individuals who have a vulnerability to develop addiction, potentially allowing interventions to be targeted at those at greater risk.
1st issue 2009
Neurobiological research in addiction and that repeated exposure to drugs of abuse disrupts this regulation.
Over time, noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons become autonomous and hyper-reactive to external stimuli and arguably this druginduced long-term uncoupling explains dysfunctions in motivation and in the ability to inhibit impulses.
‘Developments in neuroscience are transforming our understanding of how people become addicted to drugs while opening-up avenues of investigation for new approaches to treatment.
We must, however, ensure that such beneficial new approaches are rigorously evaluated prior to implementation to ensure maximum success and financial efficiency.’
Almost all drugs known to induce abuse or addiction in humans increase the release of a neurotransmitter called dopamine in a sub-cortical structure, the nucleus accumbens.
The cell bodies of neurons which release dopamine are located in the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra (see figure).
These dopaminergic neurons form the meso-corticolimbic pathway.
They stimulate different cerebral structures, such as the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala and the hippocampus, which are part of a circuitry called the ‘reward system’.
Animal studies and other evidence suggest great variability in vulnerability to addiction.
New technologies mean that neurobiological research can start to identify neuropsychological and genetic differences in individuals that may influence their chances of developing addiction if they use drugs.
New technologies in addiction research non-invasive techniques which may help to identify neuropsychological deficits that may be the primary source of an individual’s inability to stop using drugs.
Traditional and newtreatments of addiction
Advances in genomic and molecular biology, such as the ability to clone and sequence receptor subtypes, transporters and endogenous agonists, have enabled scientists to identify and specifically target relevant receptor or transporter sites with drugs that either block (antagonists) or facilitate (agonists or partial agonists) activity.
Most neurobiological models of addiction argue that, because drugs of abuse release dopamine and activate the reward system, addiction is due to a modification of kinetic reactions and increased dopamine release.
This dysregulation would correspond either to an increased reactivity of dopaminergic neurons to specific stimuli linked to the pleasurable and addictive product or to a down-regulation of dopamine signalling and a dampening of activity in the reward pathway.
In natural situations, dopamine is released when a rewarding experience is new, better than expected or unanticipated.
This release of dopamine helps the individual to memorise signals announcing a reward.
Hence, when the dopamine system becomes over-aroused by drug use, pursuit of the repetition of these effects can dominate other important, goal-directed activities.
Newmodels in theneurobiology of addiction
In humans, genetic studies have tried to identify specific addiction susceptibility genes.
Large-scale linkage and association studies have identified numerous promising candidate genes that confer vulnerability to addiction but, to date, few of these alleles have been consistently replicated and many of the associations are modest.
Addiction has traditionally been treated by a combination of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments.
Usual pharmacological treatments include: (i) drugs that either block the addictive drug from working (e.g. naltrexone as a relapse prevention of heroin dependence) or make it unpleasant (e.g. disulfiram for alcohol dependence) or (ii) drugs that replace the addictive drug with a less harmful version of the drug (e.g. opioid substitution treatment using methadone).
Nicotine replacement therapy is a common form of substitution treatment for smoked tobacco but is not particularly effective.
Some treatments may also be used for a short period to help wean individuals off all drugs.
Psychosocial interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational interviewing, drug counselling or 12-step support groups.
These therapies provide an important adjunct to pharmacological and medical treatments in achieving a long-term successful outcome.
Some recent studies suggest that, despite the critical and unquestionable role dopamine plays in reward, drugs of abuse may not necessarily induce addiction via a direct effect on dopaminergic neurons.
There is some evidence that dopamine acts downstream to two other neuromodulators, noradrenaline and serotonin, responsible for vigilance and for the control of impulsivity, respectively.
Animal studies indicate that noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons are coupled (i.e. limit the activity of each other)
Progress in neurobiological research on addiction has led to the use of drugs which target the dopaminergic system. However, this strategy has not yet proven effective in
Neuroimaging, using technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalograph (MEG), and electroencephalograph (EEG), has provided insight into the way in which druginduced changes in the brain can produce the type of cognitive deficits seen in people addicted to drugs. These are
Causal models of addiction treating addiction, possibly because the wrong dopamine receptor has been targeted (i.e. D2) or because other modulatory neurotransmitter systems also require consideration.
choices or act upon them. Drug use encompasses a complex set of behaviours and even the autonomy of dependent individuals is variable.
One risk of an overly simplified interpretation of the emerging neurobiological evidence is that it could be inappropriately used to justify coerced, highly invasive or even damaging treatments, by proponents overly optimistic about their ability to cure addiction and without showing sufficient concern for broader human rights and ethical implications.
Ethical and policyimplications
How addiction is understood by society is important for deciding which responses are appropriate.
The definition of addiction as a disorder in which an individual’s control over their drug use is impaired can be contrasted with a historical perspective where drug users were seen as autonomous individuals who voluntarily engaged in illegal activities.
Even today, some authors remain sceptical about the existence of addiction, and the extent to which dependent individuals have autonomy over their actions remains a question of fundamental importance.
Although these brain changes may explain why addicts continue to use drugs despite tolerance to their pleasurable effects and serious adverse consequences, this model may also be used to argue that addicts may lack the autonomy to make informed
A number of other novel treatment approaches are in development or are being researched which may provide new approaches to treating some forms of drug dependence.
These include immunotherapies in the form of ‘vaccines’ against the effects of nicotine, cocaine and heroin that act by binding to the target drug in the bloodstream, thus preventing it from reaching the brain.
Neurosurgery is the most invasive and permanent form of experimental treatment, but there exist strong ethical objections to this approach.
Less extreme but still raising ethical concerns is deep brain stimulation which involves the insertion of electrical stimulating electrodes into the regions of the brain involved in addiction, such as the insula.
A less invasive approach is transcranial magnetic stimulation that involves placing a small magnetic coil against an individual’s skull in order to block or enhance neural activity.
None of these approaches are currently
Dopaminergic projections from midbrain to forebrain
Ventral tegmental area
Note: Meso-corticolimbic dopaminergic neurons from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra project to an important structure of the reward circuitry, the nucleus accumbens, and to the cortical areas primarily responsible for making decisions, such as whether to use drugs (e.g. the prefrontal cortex, and the cingulate gyrus).
Projections from the midbrain also make connections with the caudate and the putamen (labelled Striatum in the figure). Source: Hyman et al., 2006.
Neurobiological research can make a significant contribution to our understanding of the extent to which addicts are autonomous, and therefore responsible for their actions.
The autonomy of addicts in making choices about their drug use is undoubtedly impaired when they are acutely intoxicated or experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms.
However, the extent of impairment varies greatly and informed consent, i.e. the process by which individuals agree to treatment in the full knowledge of its possible risks and benefits, and without coercion, can and should be obtained after patient stabilisation.
If neurobiological research leads to the development of new treatment approaches, they will join and hopefully complement existing treatments.
Patients will need to be given information on different treatment options, and the costs and benefits of any new therapy should be carefully considered along with its potential efficacy.
Treatments that are invasive or dangerous are difficult to justify if safer options already exist.
Important ethical considerations will surely arise if patients are denied free choices over which treatment they can pursue: these issues are likely to be particularly important for treatments offered within the criminal justice system where some degree of coercion may be present.
A generally accepted ethical principle is that care available in prison settings should be equivalent to that available to the wider community.
Ethical concerns would arise if new therapies were disproportionately targeted on those in custody and other treatments of proven efficacy denied.

Conclusions and policy considerations
Some approaches in this area may be used in ways that raise important ethical and social concerns which could offset, or even be greater than potential benefits.
Neurobiological research provides support for a ‘medical model’ of addiction.
However, many drug issues concern the non-dependent use of illicit substances and the question of which approaches are appropriate to encourage addicted individuals into treatment — particularly those who may not want to be treated — is a critical one.
The assumption that repeated consumption of drugs of abuse induces long-term modifications in cerebral neurotransmission presents a strong argument for research aimed at characterising these modifications and finding ways to reverse them.
New methodologies such as neuroimaging and genetic research may help to better understand variations in vulnerability to addiction, even if social factors are also clearly important.
However, the extent to which this can be used in practice remains questionable.

Drugs in focus
Responding to drug driving in Europe
Until then, this policy briefing summarises the key issues facing policymakers and describes developments across Europe that may assist decision-making on the topic.
and benzodiazepines are generally impairing; of the opioids, heroin can impair severely, methadone less so, and buprenorphine even less.
The data for stimulant drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy are more mixed, but suggest that high doses are associated with impairment.
Yet, an objective measure for impairment for each drug, similar to the blood alcohol concentration, remains elusive.
Reducing the loss of life caused by driving under the influence of psychoactive substances requires measures that are based on a scientific understanding of this complex phenomenon.
The challenge to legislators is to design sound and effective laws that can be enforced, and that give a clear message to the public.
Many of the accidents and deaths that occur on European roads are caused by drivers whose performance is impaired by a psychoactive substance.
Alcohol alone is estimated to account for up to 10 000 road deaths a year in the European Union, one quarter of all road deaths.
No comparable figures are available for road accidents related to illicit drugs and psychoactive medicines, though these have been receiving increasing attention over the past decade.
Studies on the effects of psychoactive substances on driving performance suggest that while both illicit and therapeutic drugs can affect driving, the effects and their extent can vary greatly from substance to substance.
The latest research suggests that cannabis can reduce performance
The complex issue of drug driving is currently being investigated by DRUID, a major EU project that began in 2006 and will continue until 2010.
DRUID aims to provide a solid basis for harmonised, EU-wide regulations for driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs and medicine.
Definition
Driving under the influence: Depending on the country’s laws, this may refer to a driver who has: a measured reduction of cognitive or psychomotor skills, impulsivity; or more than a defined amount of drug in the blood, expected to produce such effects at that level; or any trace of drugs in the blood.
Reports of drug driving incidents often receive much media
Various psychoactive medicines, which might or might not be legally prescribed and consumed, can impair driving skills.
But, few countries have reliable statistics on the prevalence of driving under the influence of drugs.
Obtaining sound scientific evidence on behavioural effects,
Currently, police experience considerable difficulty with the accurate and rapid identification of drug driving at the roadside.
prevalence and accident risk is difficult with the available data.
Many of the studies have small samples and it is often difficult to generalise from their results.
Key audiences may not be hearing the message, or they may be ignoring it.
Reflecting the scientific debate about the precise effects of the substances, the legal definition of the offence of driving under the influence of drugs differs among EU Member States.
Extent of drug driving is not studied in many European countries
The number of people sampled has ranged from under 50 to over 10 000, with more than one third of the studies reporting on fewer than 500 individuals.
Studies on drug prevalence in drivers published between 1999 and 2007 provide data for only 13 of the 27 EU Member States and Norway.
medicines and illicit drugs, others do.
In Finland and Sweden, new zero-tolerance laws for illicit drugs were passed following the experience that the offence of impaired driving was extremely difficult to prove.
In Cyprus, this problem is addressed by prosecuting such drivers for illegal consumption of drugs.
However, Belgium and the United Kingdom specifically prohibit use of a test result for drug driving as evidence for any other offence.
National legislation or policies may also limit the scope and comparability of prevalence studies.
For example, random roadside tests for drugs are not permitted in most countries.
In some countries, tests are only carried out for illicit drugs, and the prevalence of psychoactive medicines cannot be ascertained.
Random roadside surveys of drivers, which can give a representative picture of the entire driving population, are available for three EU Member States and Norway.
Other surveys provide data on drug use among specific subsets of drivers.
While some studies considered only drivers involved in fatal accidents, others looked at sample groups of injured drivers, killed drivers, drivers involved in accidents, and drivers suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
However, the results of these various studies are not scientifically comparable.
A positive test for alcohol may override any requirement for drug testing, with resource limitations and prosecution requirements taking priority over any need for comprehensive data gathering.
This has been the case in Denmark, Estonia, Ireland and Portugal.
The French SAM study, one of the most extensive studies in recent years on the subject, was made possible by a change to the national Road Code obliging the police, in defined circumstances, to test all drivers for drugs.
Evidence of drug-taking may be detected in different biological samples, including blood, urine, saliva, sweat and even hair.
Blood is the ideal matrix for legal proof of impairment, but roadside screening by oral fluid (saliva) is desirable for convenience.
Threshold levels for the drugs may be set at the lower limit of detection, or at levels where impairment may be expected to start.
However, while some drugs, including cannabis and opioids, appear to have a dosedependent impairing effect, others such as amphetamines do not.
Tolerance and interactions with alcohol or other drugs complicate calculations further.
In France, drivers found combining drugs with alcohol receive a higher penalty.
Responding to psychoactive medicines
Generally, cannabis is the most common illicit substance detected, and benzodiazepines are the most commonly reported psychoactive medicines.
Overall, the evidence points to much higher prevalences of both illicit and prescription drugs, often in combination with alcohol, among drivers involved in accidents or suspected of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
New international guidance for standardisation of study designs have been drawn up with the assistance of the EMCDDA and the European Commission’s DG Transport.
It takes into account differences between countries’ legislation and testing policies, providing over a hundred recommendations subdivided into the areas of behaviour, epidemiology, and toxicology.
Where to draw the line — or lines?
The overall scarcity of information continues despite a recommendation made in 2002 by the European Commission’s expert working group on drugs, medicines and driving that all drivers involved in a fatal accident should be tested for alcohol and drug use.
Barriers to building up scientific evidence
Psychoactive medicines, such as painkillers (opioids), sedatives (benzodiazepines), antidepressants and antihistamines can have sometimes considerable effects on the capabilities of drivers.
Results from studies suggest that drivers may be using these drugs either for medical reasons following prescription, or misusing them, sometimes together with illicit substances.
Concern is also growing about the possible impact of the increasing numbers of drug users receiving opioid substitution treatment.
Most European countries take one of two approaches to defining the offence of driving under the influence of drugs.
Eleven countries only penalise impaired driving, whether caused by illicit drugs or medicines.
Eleven other countries have adopted a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy, penalising any driving after drug-taking.
In seven countries, these two approaches are combined in a tiered response to drug driving offenders.
Most countries’ laws penalise impairment from any drug, whether illicit or medicinal.
In France, Austria and Portugal, some impairing psychoactive medicines such as benzodiazepines are not covered by the drug driving law, though they may be
Some ‘zero-tolerance’ countries make no distinction between psychoactive
More than 30 studies on the prevalence of drugs among drivers have been carried out across Europe since 1999.
However, these studies have used various methods and sampled different groups of drivers, making it difficult to draw overall conclusions.
2004, a system in Victoria, Australia uses two saliva tests in series at the roadside to achieve a low false positive rate; prosecution will be based on the results of a subsequent laboratory confirmation of the second sample.
In the EU, while France uses roadside saliva tests, prosecution is based on the results of a blood test.
Are prevention campaigns effective?
group on drugs, medicines and driving recommended that police involved in traffic control receive mandatory training in recognising the signs of impairment due to drugs.
These tests may include, for example, examination of the size of the pupils, coordination tests, behavioural tests, reactions and manner of speaking.
Yet by 2007, only four EU countries (Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom) reported obligatory training in this area for traffic police, while 11 reported some ad hoc training.
Furthermore, the tests are not the same in each country.
covered by a general offence such as dangerous driving.
In contrast, laws in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia penalise driving with any trace of a substance, even if medicinal.
Seven countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Finland) have adopted a two-stage system that penalises any trace of an illicit substance with a non-criminal or lower-level criminal fine, but more severely penalises impairment by any substance.
In Latvia, impairment by a medicinal substance will incur a lower fine than any trace of an illicit substance.
In Finland and Sweden, drivers found with medicines may be exempted from charge if they can provide a medical prescription, though they may still be charged if their driving was judged impaired.
They also show that many drivers are unaware of the effects of combining drugs and alcohol.
After stopping a driver, the police officer may need to perform an initial screening for drug use, by analysing behaviour or biological samples.
Oral fluid (saliva) might be acceptable for roadside screening of drivers — urine is not appropriate to indicate impairment.
The reliability of devices for roadside saliva testing, however, has yet to be confirmed.
Of the nine on-site saliva-testing devices evaluated by the EU’s Rosita-2 project between 2003 and 2005, not one could be recommended for roadside screening of drivers.
The limitations of the devices might be compensated to some extent by modifying the testing protocol.
Prevention campaigns targeting drug driving have been carried out in several EU Member States.
These generally take the form of mass media campaigns, often including information on drugs within a wider campaign focussing on alcohol.
Drug driving in EU Member States may be defined as impairment caused by drugs or having any trace of drugs in the blood (‘zero tolerance’), and some countries combine both definitions in a two-tier system
Zero tolerance Impairment
Two-tier system No information
General messages that reach young users of cannabis, however, are unlikely to be listened to, or even noticed, by older users of psychoactive medicines, and vice versa.
Similarly, both groups may feel that warnings about alcohol do not apply to them.
Prevention programmes are more likely to succeed if they are tailored to their target group.
Providing clear information to patients taking psychoactive medicines may prevent them from driving while adversely affected.
For this, most countries rely on the patient information leaflet inside the packaging, for example advising caution if the patient feels sleepy.
Yet the patient’s subjective senses are not always reliable or accurate.
The use of a clear symbol or pictogram on the outer packaging of medicines that may affect driving ability is currently reported by only five countries.

Responding to drug driving in Europe: Conclusions and policy considerations
National laws and their enforcement need to strike a balance between concerns about ensuring road safety and the therapeutic needs of individuals.
Surveys on the prevalence of drugs in drivers need to be conducted in all EU Member States.
Testing all drivers involved in a fatal accident for drug and alcohol use would provide an important source of information for monitoring the problem.
Legal frameworks require review, as even with the limitations of existing testing methodology, more effective procedures are possible.
And, new options are likely to become available.
New guidelines on study design are available that take into account the variety of legal and practical constraints in different countries.
Policymakers should consider the latest scientific information available when designing legal responses.

The European environment _BAR_ State and outlook 2010
However, major environmental challenges remain which will have significant consequences for Europe if left unaddressed.
What differs in 2010, compared to previous EEA European environment — State and outlook reports, is an enhanced understanding of the links between environmental challenges combined with unprecedented global megatrends.
These overarching findings are supported by the following 10 key messages:
The result is a significant environmental footprint in Europe and elsewhere.
Nature and biodiversity — Europe has established an extensive network of protected areas and programmes to reverse the loss of endangered species.
However, widespread alteration of landscapes, degradation of ecosystems and loss of natural capital mean that the EU will not meet its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010.
To improve the situation we must prioritise biodiversity and ecosystems in policymaking at all scales, particularly addressing agriculture, fisheries, regional development, cohesion and spatial planning.
Natural resources and waste — Environmental regulation and eco-innovation have increased resource efficiency through a relative decoupling of resource use, emissions and waste generation from economic growth in some areas.
However, absolute decoupling remains a challenge, especially for households.
This indicates scope not only to improve production processes further, but also to alter consumption patterns to reduce environmental pressures.
Environment, health and quality of life — Water and air pollution have declined but not enough to achieve good ecological quality in all water bodies or to ensure good air quality in all urban areas.
Links between the state of Europe's environment and various global megatrends imply increasing systemic risks.
These interdependencies and trends, many of them outside Europe's direct influence, will have significant consequences and potential risks for the resilience and sustainable development of Europe's economy and society.
The notion of dedicated management of natural capital and ecosystem services is a compelling integrating concept for dealing with environmental pressures from multiple sectors. Spatial planning, resource accounting and coherence among sectoral
Key message ss age ss policies implemented at all scales can help balance the need to preserve natural capital and use it to fuel the economy.
A more integrated approach of this sort would also provide a framework for measuring progress more broadly and underpin coherent analyses across multiple policy targets.
Increased resource efficiency and security can be achieved, for example, using extended life cycle approaches to reflect the full environmental impacts of products and activities.
This can reduce Europe's dependence on resources globally and promote innovation.
Pricing that takes full account of resource use impacts will be important for steering business and consumer behaviour towards enhanced resource efficiency.
Clustering sectoral policies according to their resource needs and environmental pressures would improve coherence, address shared challenges efficiently, maximise economic and social benefits and help avoid unintended consequences.
Implementing environmental policies and strengthening environmental governance will continue to provide benefits.
Better implementation of sectoral and environmental policies will help ensure that goals are achieved and provide regulatory stability for businesses.
A broader commitment to environmental monitoring and up-to-date reporting of environmental pollutants and wastes, using the best available information and technologies, will make environmental governance more effective.
This includes reducing long-term remediation costs through early action.
Transformation towards a greener European economy will ensure the long-term environmental sustainability of Europe and its neighbourhood.
In this context, shifts in attitudes will be important.
Together, regulators, businesses and citizens could participate more widely in managing natural capital and ecosystem services, creating new and innovative ways to use resources efficiently and designing equitable fiscal reforms.
Using education and various social media, citizens can be engaged in tackling global issues such as meeting the 2 °C climate target.
The seeds for future actions exist: the task ahead is to help them take root and flourish.
The state of the environment in Europe
Europe relies heavily on natural capital and ecosystems at home and abroad
The Europe addressed in this report is home to around 600 million
With an average of 100 people per km2, Europe is one of the most densely populated regions of the world; some 75 % of the total population lives in urban
areas (
Europeans depend heavily on the stocks of natural capital and flows of ecosystem services that lie within and beyond Europe's borders.
Two fundamental questions arise from this dependency.
Are the stocks and flows today being used sustainably to supply essential benefits, such as food, water, energy, materials, as well as climate and flood regulation?
Are today's environmental resources, i.e. air, water, soil, forests, biodiversity, secure enough to be able to sustain people and economies in good health in the future?
Access to reliable up-to-date information about the environment provides a basis for action
To answer such questions, citizens and policymakers require accessible, relevant, credible, and legitimate information.
According to various polls, people concerned about the state of the environment see that providing more information on environmental trends and pressures is one of the most effective ways of tackling environmental problems, along with fines and strong enforcement (3).
The aim of the European Environment Agency (EEA) is to provide such timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information on the environment to support sustainable development and help achieve significant and measurable improvements in Europe's environment (4).

The report does not present any warnings of imminent environmental collapse.
However, it does note that some local and global thresholds are being crossed, and that negative environmental trends could lead to dramatic and irreversible damage to some of the ecosystems and services that we take for granted.
In other words, the current insufficient rate of progress observed over the past few decades in addressing environmental issues may severely undermine our ability to deal with potential future negative impacts.
Looking at the state of the environment and future challenges from different perspectives
Subsequent chapters assess, in more detail, key trends in the four environmental priority issues already mentioned.
Chapters 2 to 5 provide an assessment of the state of, trends in and prospects for each of these issues.
Chapter 6 reflects on the many direct and indirect connections across issues from the perspectives of natural capital and ecosystem services, focusing on land, soil and water resources.
Chapter 7 uses another lens by looking out to the rest of the world in terms of key socioeconomic and environmental megatrends that can be expected to affect Europe's environment.
The final chapter, Chapter 8, reflects on the findings of the previous chapters and their implications for future environmental priorities.
It does this through an additional series of lenses; the lens of managing natural capital and ecosystem services, the lens of a green economy, the lens of strengthened integrated policies and the lens of state-of-the-art information systems, and concludes that:
• better implementation and further strengthening of environmental protection provide multiple benefits;
• dedicated management of natural capital and ecosystem services increases resilience;
Climate change
Climate change could lead to catastrophic impacts if unchecked
While the global climate has been remarkably stable for the past 10 000 years, providing a backdrop for the development of human

Increases in GHG emissions are largely due to the use of fossil fuels, although deforestation, land-use change and agriculture also provide significant but smaller contributions.
As a consequence, the average global air temperature in 2009 had risen by 0.7 to 0.8 °C since pre-industrial times (3).
Indeed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that global warming since the middle of the 20th century is very likely to have been due to human
influences (
In addition, best estimates of current projections suggest global mean temperatures could rise by as much as 1.8 to 4.0 °C — or 1.1 to 6.4 °C taking into account the full uncertainty range — over the course of this century if global action to limit GHG emissions proves unsuccessful (4).
Recent observations give reason to believe that the rate of growth of GHG emissions and many climate impacts are approaching the upper boundary of the IPCC range of projections
rather than the lower ones (
Changes in climate and temperature increases of such magnitude are associated with a wide range of potential impacts.
Already over the last three decades, warming has had a discernible influence at the global scale on observed changes in many human and natural systems

— including shifts in precipitation patterns, rising global mean sea level, the retreat of glaciers and decline in the extent of Arctic sea ice coverage.
Other consequences of changing climatic conditions include increases in global mean ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice sheets, increased flood risk for urban areas and ecosystems, ocean acidification, and extreme climatic events including heat waves.
The impacts of climate change are expected to be felt in all regions of the planet, and Europe is no exception.
Unless action is taken, climatic changes are expected to lead to considerable adverse impacts.

The EU has been reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, and will meet its Kyoto obligation
Meeting the target of limiting global temperatures increases to less than 2 °C will require a concerted global effort — including further substantial GHG emission reductions in Europe.
In 2008, the EU was responsible for between 11 and 12 % of global GHG emissions (9) — while being home to 8 % of the world's population.
According to current projections taking into account population growth and economic development worldwide, Europe's percentage contribution will decrease, as emissions in emerging economies continue to increase (10).
Annual emissions of GHG in the EU in 2008 corresponded to around
Meanwhile, the EU is in third place behind China and the USA ( the trends in EU GHG emissions relative to economic development — measured as gross domestic product (GDP) — in the EU indicate an overall decoupling of emissions from economic development over time.
Between 1990 and 2007, emissions per unit of GDP decreased in the EU-27 by more than a third (11).
However, it should be noted that these emission figures only represent what is emitted within the EU territory, calculated according to agreed international guidelines under UNFCCC.
Europe's contribution to global emissions could be greater if European imports of goods and services, with their 'embedded carbon', are taken into account.
Current emission data confirm that the EU-15 Member States are on track to meet their joint target of cutting emissions by 8 % compared to base-year levels — 1990 for most countries — during the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol: the years 2008 to 2012.
Reductions in the EU-27 have been even greater than in the EU-15; domestic GHG emissions fell by approximately 11 % between 1990
and 2008 (

A closer look at key sectoral greenhouse gas emissions reveals mixed trends
Historic trends of GHG emissions in the EU over the past 20 years are
• increases in the production of electricity and heat by thermal plants, which has increased both in absolute terms and in comparison with other sources;
• economic growth in manufacturing industries;
• increasing transport demand for passengers and freight;
• and demographic changes over the past decades.
• fuel efficiency improvements in vehicles;
• decreases in emissions from agriculture (by more than 20 % since 1990);
• a shift from coal to less polluting fuels, particularly gas and biomass, for the production of electricity and heat;
EU GHG emissions trends between 1990 and 2008 were dominated by the two largest emitters, Germany and the United Kingdom, which together were responsible for more than half of the total reduction in the EU.

Towards a resource-efficient transport system
The increases in greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector — as well as several other environmental impacts of transport — continue to be closely linked to economic growth.
The EEA's annual Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM) report monitors the progress and effectiveness of efforts to integrate transport and environment strategies.
For 2009, the report highlighted the following trends and findings:
•Freight transport tends to grow slightly faster than the economy, with road and air freight recording the largest increases in the EU-27 (43 % and 35 %, respectively, between 1997 and 2007).
The share of rail and inland waterways in the total freight volumes declined during that period.
•Passenger transport continued to grow but at a slower rate than the economy.
Air travel within the EU remained the fastest growth area, increasing 48 % between 1997 and 2007.
Car journeys remained the dominant mode of transport, accounting for 72 % of all passenger kilometres in the EU-27.
•Greenhouse gas emissions from transport (excluding international aviation and maritime transport) grew by 28 % between 1990 and 2007 in EEA countries (by 24 % in EU-27), and now account for around 19 % of total emissions.
•In the European Union, only Germany and Sweden are on track to meet their 2010 indicative targets for biofuels use (however, see also discussion related to bioenergy production in Chapter 6).
•Despite recent reductions in air pollutant emissions, road transport was the largest emitter of nitrogen oxides and the second largest contributor of pollutants forming particulate matter in 2007 (see also Chapter 5).
•Road traffic remains by far the largest source of exposure to transport noise.
The number of people exposed to damaging noise levels, especially at night, is expected to increase unless effective noise policies are developed and implemented in full (see also Chapter 5).
The report concludes that addressing the environmental aspects of transport policy effectively requires a vision for what the transport system should be like by the mid 21st century.
The process of establishing a new Common Transport Policy is essentially about creating this vision and then designing policies to achieve it.

Projections for climate change suggest that the suitability of some regions for tourism — especially in the Mediterranean — may decline during the summer months, although there may be an increase during other seasons.
Similarly, opportunities for expanding tourism in northern Europe may come about. However, over a longer period and with increasing extreme events, adverse effects are likely to dominate in many parts of Europe (6).
Temperature increases are projected to be greater than average in the Arctic, placing particular pressure on its very fragile ecosystems. Additional environmental pressures may result from easier access to oil and gas reserves, as well as new shipping routes as ice cover decreases (20).

Climate change is projected to have major impacts on ecosystems, water resources and human health
Climate change is projected to play a substantial role in biodiversity loss and puts ecosystem functions at risk.
Changing climatic conditions are responsible, for example, for the observed northward and uphill distribution shifts of many European plant species.
These are projected to need, for survival, to move several hundred kilometres to the north during the 21st century — which will not always be possible.
A combination of the rate of climate change and habitat fragmentation, which results from obstacles such as roads and other infrastructure, is likely to impede the migration of many plant and animal species, and may lead to species composition changes and a continuing decline in European biodiversity.
The timing of seasonal events, phenology, for plants and the life cycles of animal groups — both terrestrial and marine — alters with climatic change (6).
Changes in seasonal events, flowering dates and agricultural growing seasons are observed and projected.
Phenology shifts have also increased the length of the growing season of several agricultural crops in northern latitudes over recent decades, favouring the introduction of new species that were not previously suitable.
At the same time, there has been a shortening of the growing season at southern latitudes.
Such changes in the cycles of agricultural crops are projected to continue — potentially severely impacting agricultural practices (G
Similarly, climatic changes are expected to affect aquatic ecosystems.
Warming of surface water can have several effects on water quality, and hence on human use.
These include a greater likelihood for algal blooms to occur and the movement of freshwater species northwards, as well as changes in phenology.
Also within marine ecosystems, climatic changes are likely to affect the geographic distribution of plankton and fish, for example a changed timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom, putting additional pressures on fish stocks and related economic activities.
A further major potential impact of climate change, in combination with land-use changes and water management practices, is the

Adaptation (24) is a first step towards an adaptation strategy to reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, and complements actions at national, regional and even local levels.
Integration of adaptation into environmental and sectoral policy domains — such as those related to water, nature and biodiversity, and resource efficiency — is an important aim.
However, the EU White Paper on Adaptation recognises that limited knowledge is a key barrier and calls for a stronger knowledge base.
To address related gaps, the creation of a European clearinghouse on climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation is foreseen.
This aims to enable and encourage the sharing of information and good adaptation practices between all stakeholders.
Responding to climate change also affects other environmental challenges
Climate change is a result of one of the greatest market failures the world has seen (25).
The issue is closely intertwined with other environmental issues as well as broader societal and economic developments.
Responding to climate change, by mitigating or adapting, can and should therefore not be done in isolation — as responses will undoubtedly affect other environmental issues both directly and indirectly (Chapter 6).
Synergies between adaptation and mitigation measures are possible (for example in the context of land and ocean management) and adaptation can help increase resilience against other environmental challenges.
Meanwhile, 'mal-adaptation' is to be avoided; this refers to measures that are either disproportionate, cost-ineffective or conflict with other policy objectives in the long term (such as artificial snow making or air conditioning vis-à-vis mitigation targets) (21).
Many climate change mitigation measures will deliver ancillary environmental benefits including reductions in emissions of air pollutants from fossil fuel combustion.
Conversely, reduced air pollutant emissions related to climate change policies are also expected to lead to a fall in pressures on public health systems and ecosystems, for example, through lower urban air pollution or decreased levels of acidification (6).
Climate change policies are already reducing the overall cost of pollution abatement needed to meet the objectives of the EU's
Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution (26
It has been suggested that the inclusion of the effects of air pollution on climate change in air quality strategies delivers substantial efficiency gains by reducing particulate matter and ozone precursors in addition to targeting CO
2 and other
The implementation of measures to combat climate change is likely to deliver considerable ancillary benefits in air pollution abatement by 2030.
This includes lower overall costs of controlling air pollutant emissions of the order of EUR 10 billion per year and a reduction in
Biodiversity loss degrades natural capital and ecosystem services
'Biodiversity' includes all living organisms found in the atmosphere, on land and in water.
All species have a role and provide the 'fabric of life' on which we depend: from the smallest bacteria in the soil to the largest mammal in the ocean (1).
The four basic building blocks of biodiversity are genes, species, habitats and ecosystems (A).
B and sustainable provisioning of natural resources (
Furthermore it is closely intertwined with other environmental issues, such as the adaptation to climate change or protecting human health.
Europe's biodiversity is heavily influenced by human activities including agriculture, forestry and fisheries, as well as urbanisation.
Roughly half of Europe's land area is farmed, most forests are exploited, and natural areas are increasingly fragmented by urban areas and infrastructural development.
The marine environment is also heavily affected, not just by unsustainable fisheries, but also by other activities such as offshore extraction of oil and gas, sand and gravel extraction, shipping, and offshore wind farms.
Exploitation of natural resources typically leads to disturbance and changes in the diversity of species and habitats.
Conversely, extensive agricultural patterns, as seen in Europe's traditional agricultural landscapes, have contributed to a higher species diversity at a regional level if compared to what could be expected in strictly natural systems.
Over-exploitation, however, can lead to degradation of natural ecosystems and ultimately to species extinctions.
Examples of such ecological feedbacks are the collapse of commercial fish stocks through overfishing, the decline of pollinators due to intensive agriculture, and reduced water retention and increased flooding risks due to the destruction of moorland.
2) turned the debate on biodiversity loss
Loss of biodiversity can thus lead to degradation of 'ecosystem services' and undermine human well-being.
The soil, for example, is a key component of ecosystems, and supports a rich variety of organisms and provides many regulating and supporting services. Yet it is only, at most, a few meters thick (and often considerably less), and subject to degradation through erosion, pollution, compaction and salinisation (Chapter 6).
Although Europe's population is expected to remain roughly stable over the next decades, the consequences for biodiversity of increasing global resource demand for food, fibres, energy and water, and lifestyle changes are expected to continue to manifest themselves (see Chapter 7).
Ecosystems provide a number of basic services that are essential for using Earth's resources sustainably. These include:
•Provisioning services — the resources that are directly exploited by humans, such as food, fibres, water, raw materials, medicines;
•Supporting services — the processes that indirectly allow exploitation of natural resources, such as primary production, pollination;
•Regulating services — the natural mechanisms responsible for climate regulation, nutrient and water circulation, pest regulation, flood prevention, etc.;
•Cultural services — the benefits people gain from the natural environment for recreational, cultural and spiritual purposes.
In this framework, biodiversity is the basic environmental asset.
a ).

Nature and
The challenge is therefore to reduce Europe's impact on the global environment while maintaining biodiversity at a level where ecosystem services, the sustainable use of natural resources and human wellbeing are secured.
The EU is committed to halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010.
The main actions have been aimed at selected habitats and species through the Natura 2000 network, biodiversity of the wider countryside, the marine environment, invasive alien species, and adaptation to climate change (3).
The 6th EAP mid-term review in 2006/2007 increased the emphasis on the economic valuation of biodiversity loss, resulting in The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative (4) (see Chapter 8).
It has become increasingly clear, however, that despite progress in
some areas, the 2010 target will not be met (
Recognising the urgent need for increased efforts, the European Council endorsed the long-term biodiversity vision for 2050 and a 2020 headline target, adopted by the Environment Council on 15 March 2010, of halting the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020, and restoring them in so far as feasible, while stepping up the EU contribution to averting global biodiversity loss (9).
A limited number of measurable sub-targets will be developed using, for example, baseline data for 2010 (1).
Key policy instruments are the EU Birds and Habitats

Again, Article 17 reporting under the Habitats Directive provides additional material for target species.
The data for common bird species suggest a stabilisation at low levels during the last decade.
Populations of forest birds have declined by around 15 % since 1990, but from 2000 onwards numbers appear stable.
Farmland bird populations declined dramatically in the 1980s, mainly due to agricultural intensification.
Their populations have remained stable since the mid-1990s, albeit at a low level.
General farming trends (such as lower input use, increased set-aside and share of organic farming) and policy measures (such as targeted
agri-environment schemes) may have contributed to this (
Grassland butterfly populations, however, have declined by a further 50 % since 1990, indicating the impact of further intensification of agriculture on the one hand and abandonment on the other.

The effects on ecosystems include damage to forests and lakes from acidification; habitat deterioration due to nutrient enrichment; algal blooms caused by nutrient enrichment; and neural and endocrine disruption in species by pesticides, steroidal estrogens and industrial chemicals like PCBs.
Most European data regarding the effects of pollutants on biodiversity and ecosystems concern acidification and eutrophication (G
2 the 1970s.
The area subject to acidification has decreased further since
In 2010, 10 % of the EEA-32 natural ecosystem area is, however, still subject to acid depositions beyond its critical load.
With sulphur emissions declining, nitrogen emitted by agriculture is now the principal acidifying component in our air (39).
Agriculture is also a major source of eutrophication through emissions of excess nitrogen and phosphorous, both used as nutrients.
The agricultural nutrient balance for many EU Member States has improved in recent years, but more than 40 % of sensitive terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem areas are still subject to atmospheric nitrogen deposition beyond their critical loads.
Agricultural nitrogen loads are expected to remain high as nitrogen fertiliser use in the EU is projected to increase by around 4 % by 2020 (40).
Phosphorous in freshwater systems stems mainly from run-off from agriculture and discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants.
There has been a significant decline of phosphate concentrations in rivers and lakes, mainly due to progressive implementation of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (41) since the early 1990s.
Current concentrations, however, often exceed the minimum level for eutrophication.
In some water bodies they are such that substantial improvements will be required to achieve good status under the Water Framework Directive (WFD).
Paramount to attainment of good status by 2015 under the WFD (will be a reduction in the excessive nutrient levels found in a number of water bodies across Europe, as well as the restoration of connectivity and hydro-morphological conditions.

Overfishing not only reduces the total stock of commercial species, but affects the age and size distribution within fish populations, as well as the species composition of the marine ecosystem.
The average size of the fish caught has decreased, and there has also been a serious decrease in the numbers of large predatory fish species, which occupy the higher trophic levels (46).
The consequences of this for the marine ecosystem are still poorly understood, but could be substantial.
While the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform in 2002 stated conservation objectives, it is widely acknowledged that these have not been achieved.
An EU Green Paper on reforming the CFP in 2009 called for a complete reform of the way fisheries are managed (47).
It acknowledges overfishing, fleet over-capacity, heavy subsidies, low economic resilience and a decline in the biomass of fish caught by European fishermen.
This marks an important step towards implementation of an ecosystem-based approach that regulates human exploitation of marine resources from the much wider perspective of ecosystem services.
Maintaining biodiversity, also at global level, is crucial for people
Biodiversity loss has ultimately far-reaching consequences for people through impacts on ecosystem services.
Large-scale cultivation and drainage of natural systems has increased carbon emissions to the air and at the same time reduced carbon and water retention capacity.
Increased run-off speed, combined with increased precipitation as a result of climate change, is a dangerous cocktail that more and more people have come to experience in the shape of serious flooding.
Biodiversity affects wellbeing also through providing recreational opportunities and appealing landscapes, a relationship that is increasingly recognised in urban design and spatial planning.
Less obvious perhaps, but equally important, is the relationship between the distribution patterns of species and habitats and vector-borne
The overall environmental impact of Europe's resource use continues to grow
Europe relies heavily on natural resources (A) to fuel its economic development.
Past and current production and consumption patterns have underpinned substantial growth in wealth across Europe.
However, concerns about the sustainability of these patterns are mounting, particularly regarding the implications related to resource use and over-use.
The assessment of natural resources and waste in this chapter complements the assessment of biotic natural resources in the previous chapter by focusing on material, and often non-renewable, resources as well as water resources.
A life-cycle perspective on natural resources addresses several environmental concerns related to production and consumption, and ties together the use of resources and the generation of waste.
While both resource use and waste generation have distinct environmental impacts, the two issues share many of the same driving forces — largely related to how and where we produce and consume goods, and how we use natural capital to sustain economic development and consumption patterns.
In Europe, resource use and waste generation continue to rise.
However, there are considerable national differences in per person resource use and waste generation, driven mainly by varying social and economic conditions as well as different levels of environmental awareness.
While resource extraction within Europe has been stable over the past decade, dependence on imports is increasing (1).
Environmental problems associated with the extraction and processing of many materials and natural resources are shifting from Europe to the respective exporting countries.
Consequently, the impacts of consumption and resource use from Europe on the global environment are increasing.
As resource use in Europe exceeds local availability, Europe's dependence on and competition for resources from elsewhere in the world raises questions about security in

Europe's ambition is to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation
Waste management has been a focus of EU environmental policies since the 1970s.
Such policies, which increasingly require the reduction, reuse and recycling of waste, are contributing to closing the loop of material use throughout the economy by providing waste-derived materials as inputs for production.
More recently, life-cycle thinking has been introduced as a guiding principle of resource management.
Environmental impacts are considered across the whole life cycle of products and services to avoid or minimise shifting the environmental burden between

Although the impacts of waste treatment on the environment have been considerably reduced, there is still potential for further improvement, first by full implementation of existing regulations, and then through the extension of existing waste policies to encourage sustainable consumption and production practices including more efficient resource use.
Waste policies can primarily reduce three types of environmental pressures: emissions from waste treatment installations such as methane from landfills; impacts from primary raw materials extraction; and air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from energy use in production processes.
Although recycling processes themselves also have environmental impacts, in most cases the overall impacts avoided by recycling and recovery are greater than those incurred in the recycling processes (17).
Waste prevention can help reduce environmental impacts during all stages of the life-cycle of resources.
Although prevention has the highest potential to reduce environmental pressures, policies to reduce waste generation have been sparse and often not very effective.
For example, there has been an emphasis on diverting biowaste,
Waste recycling (and waste prevention) is closely linked to material use.

This continues to have considerable environmental and economic consequences.
Of 8.2 billion tonnes of materials used in the EU-27 in 2007, minerals and including metals accounted for more than half, and fossil fuels and biomass for about a quarter each.
The resource use category which increased most between 1992 and 2005 was that of minerals for construction and industrial use.
Differences between individual countries are significant: the use of resources per person varies by a factor of almost ten between the highest and the lowest numbers.
Factors that determine resource use per person include climate, population density, infrastructure, availability of resources, level of economic development, and the structure of the economy.
Although the level of extraction of resources within Europe has remained stable, and in some cases has even decreased — some unmanaged burdens from past extraction persist related to mining closures.
As Europe uses up reserves that are easy to access, it will have to rely more on less concentrated ores, less accessible resources and fossil fuels with lower energy content, which are expected to cause higher environmental impacts per unit of material or energy produced.
The high use of resources to fuel economic growth increases the problems of ensuring supplies and sustainable yields, and managing the environmental impacts in relation to ecosystems' absorption capacities.
A challenge for both policy and science is how best to measure environmental impacts that result from resource use; several current initiatives aim to better quantify the environmental impacts of resource use.
Reducing resource use in Europe also reduces environmental impacts globally
European economies are creating more and more wealth from the resources that we use.
Resource efficiency in Europe has improved over the past two decades through the use of more eco-efficient technologies, the transition to service-based economies and an increased share of imports in EU economies.
However, differences in resource efficiency across Europe are substantial, with a factor of almost ten between the most and least resource-efficient EU economies.
Factors that affect resource efficiency include the technological level of production and consumption; the share of services versus heavy industry; regulatory and tax systems; and the share of imports in total resource use.

WEI: annual total water abstraction as a percentage of available long-term freshwater resources.
The warning threshold, which distinguishes a non-stresed from a water scarce region, is around 20 %, with severe scarcity occurring where the WEI exceeds 40 %.
The issues of water quantity and quality, irrigation water demand, water-use conflicts, environmental and socioeconomic aspects and risk management aspects can be better integrated in the institutional and political systems.
A first look at river basin management plans, which have been set up and reported by Member States during the first round of implementation of the WFD, indicates that a significant number of water bodies face a high risk of not achieving good ecological status by 2015.
The overall challenge which the WFD can help tackle, if implemented fully, is to ensure the sustainable availability of good water quality, as well as managing inevitable trade-offs between competing uses, such as domestic use, industry, agriculture and the environment (see also Chapter 6).
The European environment _BAR_ State and outlook 2010
Consumption patterns are key drivers of resource use and waste generation
The use of resources, water, energy and the generation of waste are all driven by our patterns of consumption and production.
The majority of greenhouse gas emissions, acidifying substances, tropospheric ozone precursor emissions and material input caused by the life-cycles of activities related to consumption can be allocated to the main consumption areas of eating and drinking, housing and infrastructures, and mobility.
Within nine countries analysed (F), these three consumption areas contributed 68 % of greenhouse gas emissions, 73 % of acidifying emissions, 69 % of tropospheric ozone precursor emissions and 64 % of direct and indirect material input, including use of domestic and imported resources in 2005.
Eating and drinking, mobility, and to a lesser extent housing, are also the areas of household consumption with the highest pressure intensities, which indicates the largest environmental pressures per Euro spent.
Reductions in environmental pressures caused by household consumption could be achieved by reducing the pressure intensities within individual consumption categories — for example, through improvements in housing energy efficiency; by switching transport expenditure from private cars to public transport; or by shifting household expenditure from a pressure-intensive category (such as transport) to a low intensity one (such as communication).
European policy has only recently begun to address the challenge of the growing use of resources and unsustainable consumption patterns. European policies, such as the Integrated Product
) and Directive on Ecodesign (
) focused on reducing the environmental impacts of products, including their energy consumption, throughout their entire life-cycle: it is estimated that over 80 % of all product-related environmental impacts are determined during the design phase of a product.
In addition, EU policies also stimulate innovation-friendly markets with the EU Lead Markets initiative (23).
The 2008 EU Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and
Production and Sustainable Industrial Policies (24

Environment, health and quality of life
Environment, health, life expectancy and social inequalities are linked
The environment plays a crucial role in people's physical, mental and social well-being.
Despite significant improvements, major differences in environmental quality and human health remain between and within European countries.
The complex relationships between environmental factors and human health, taking into account multiple pathways and interactions, should be seen in a broader spatial, socioeconomic and cultural context.
Most of the gain in life expectancy in recent decades has been due to improved survival of people above the age of 65, while before 1950 it was mostly due to a reduction in premature deaths (i.e. death below the age of 65).
On average, men are expected to live almost 81 % of their lives free of disability, and women 75 % (2).
There are, however, differences between genders, and between Member States.
The degradation of the environment, through air pollution, noise, chemicals, poor quality water and loss of natural areas, combined with lifestyle changes, may be contributing to substantial increases in rates of obesity, diabetes, diseases of the cardiovascular and nervous systems and cancer — all of which are major public health problems for Europe's population (3).
Reproductive and mental health problems are also on the rise.
Asthma, allergies (4), and some types of cancer related to environmental pressures are of particular concern for children.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the environmental burden of disease in the pan-European region at between 15 and 20 % of total deaths, and 18 to 20 % of disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) (A), with a relatively higher burden in the eastern part of the region (5). The preliminary results of a study conducted in Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, indicate that 6 to
S y n the he si s iss
12 % of the total burden of disease could be attributed to nine selected environmental factors, out of which particulate matter, noise, radon, and environmental tobacco smoke were leading.
Due to uncertainties, the results need to be interpreted with caution as an indicative ranking of environmental health impacts only (6).
The significant differences in the quality of the environment across Europe depend on the varying pressures related, for example, to urbanisation, pollution and natural resource use.
Exposures and associated health risks, as well as the benefits of pollution reduction and of a natural environment, are not uniformly distributed within populations.
Studies show that poor environmental conditions affect vulnerable groups especially (7).

The WHO night noise guidelines for Europe recommend that people should not be exposed to night noise greater than 40 dB.
Night-time noise levels of 55 dB, described as 'increasingly dangerous to public health', should be considered as an interim target in situations where the achievement of the guidelines is not feasible (28).
According to a German Environmental Survey for Children, children from families of low socioeconomic status are more heavily exposed to traffic, and annoyed by road traffic noise, during the day, as compared with children with higher socioeconomic status (31).
Urban air quality and noise often share a common source and may cluster spatially.

Pesticides in the environment have potential for unintended impacts to wildlife and humans
Pesticides disrupt essential biological processes, for example through affecting nerve transmission or mimicking hormones.
Thus, human health concerns related to exposure via water, food, or close proximity
Mixtures of pesticides are common both in the human food supply (
) and in the aquatic environment.
Though assessment of mixture toxicity has been a challenge, a single-chemical approach is likely to underestimate ecological risk, including impacts of mixture of
55 pesticides on fish (
The EU Thematic Strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides (56) sets objectives to minimise the hazards and risks to health and the environment stemming from the use of pesticides, and to improve controls on the use and distribution of pesticides.
Full implementation of the associated Pesticides Directive will be required to support the achievement of good chemical status under the Water Framework Directive (49).
Information on pesticides in surface and ground waters in Europe is limited; however, the reported levels, including pesticides classified as priority substances, can exceed environmental quality standards.
Some pesticide impacts are not captured by routine monitoring programs — for example fatal exposure of aquatic species to short-term contamination during rainfall events immediately after pesticide application to cropland (57).
These limitations combined with growing concerns about potential adverse effects strengthen the case for a more precautionary approach to their use in agriculture, horticulture and to control unwanted plant growth in public spaces close to where people live.
Good management plays a crucial role in preventing and reducing exposures.
The Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of
Chemical regulation (REACH) (47) aims to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks of chemicals.
The efforts to better protect human health and the environment through safer chemical substitutes need to be complemented by a systemic approach to chemicals assessment. Such assessments should include not only toxicity and ecotoxicity, but also address the starting material, water and energy use, transport, release of CO and
Such a 'sustainable chemistry' approach requires new, resource-efficient production processes and the development of chemicals that use fewer raw materials and are of high quality, with limited impurities to reduce or avoid waste — however, there is no comprehensive legislation on sustainable chemistry in place as yet.
Environment
Nearly all the environmental and social impacts of climate change (Chapter 2) may ultimately affect human health through altering weather patterns, and through changes in water, air and food quality and quantity, ecosystems, agriculture, livelihoods and infrastructure (63).
Climate change can multiply risks and existing health problems: potential health effects depend largely on populations' vulnerability and their ability to adapt.
The heat wave in Europe in summer 2003, with a death toll exceeding 70 000, highlighted the need for adaptation to a changing
) ( are at higher risk, and deprived population groups are more
For populations in the EU, mortality has been estimated to increase by 1 to 4 % for each degree increase of temperature above a (locally-specific) cut-off point (68).
In the 2020s, the estimated increase in heat-related mortality resulting from projected climate change could exceed 25 000 per year, mainly in central and southern European regions (69).
An anticipated impact of climate change on the spread of water, food-and vector-borne (K) diseases in Europe emphasises the need for tools to address such threats to public health (70).
Transmission patterns of communicable diseases are also influenced by ecological, social and economic factors, such as changing land-use patterns, declining biological diversity, alterations in human mobility and outdoor activity, as well as access to health care and population immunity.
This can be exemplified by the shift in the distribution of ticks, vectors of the lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis.
Other examples include the extended range in Europe of the Asian tiger mosquito, a vector of several viruses, with a potential for further transmission and dispersion under the changing climate

A broader perspective is needed to address ecosystem and health links and emerging challenges
Much progress has been achieved through dedicated approaches to improving the quality of the environment and reducing particular burdens on human health — but many threats remain.
The predominant drive for material wellbeing has played a major role in the biological and ecological disturbances witnessed today.
Preserving and extending the benefits provided by the environment for human health and wellbeing will require continuous effort to improve the quality of the environment.
Furthermore, these efforts need to be complemented by other measures, including significant changes in lifestyle and human behaviour, as well as consumption patterns.
Meanwhile, new challenges are emerging with a wide range of potential, highly uncertain, ecological and human health implications.
Nanotechnology, for example, may allow the development of new products and services which are capable of enhancing human health, conserving natural resources or protecting the environment.
However, the unique features of nanomaterials also raise concerns about potential environmental, health, occupational and general safety hazards.
The understanding of nanotoxicity is in its infancy, as are methods for assessing and managing the risks inherent in the use of some materials.
The European Commission has, for example, consulted experts and the public regarding the benefits, risks, concerns and awareness of nanotechnologies to support the preparation of a new action plan for 2010 to 2015 (81).

The increasing awareness of multi-causality, complexity, and uncertainties also means that the EU Treaty principles of precaution and prevention are even more relevant than before.
More recognition of the limits of what we can know, in time to prevent harm, is called for, as is the need to act on sufficient, rather than overwhelming, evidence of the potential harms to health, given the pros and cons of action versus inaction.

Links between environmental challenges
Links between environmental challenges point towards increasing complexity
From the analyses presented in previous chapters, it is clear that the growing demands for natural resources in recent decades are putting pressures on the environment in increasingly complex and wide-ranging ways.
Generally speaking, specific environmental issues, often with local effects, have in the past been dealt with through targeted policies and single-issue instruments, such as the approaches to waste disposal and species protection.
Since the 1990s, however, the recognition of diffuse pressures from different sources has led to an increased focus on the integration of environmental concerns within sectoral policies, for example in transport or agricultural policies.
Today's main environmental challenges are systemic in character and cannot be tackled in isolation.
The assessments of four environmental priority areas — climate change, nature and biodiversity, use of natural resources and waste, and environment and health — point to a series of direct and indirect links between environmental challenges.
Climate change, for example, impacts all other environmental issues.
Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns affect agricultural production as well as plant and animal distribution and phenology, and thus exert additional pressures on biodiversity (Chapter 3).
This may lead to species extinctions, particularly in arctic, alpine and coastal zones (Chapter 2).
Similarly, changes in climatic conditions across Europe are projected to alter existing health risks by changing the occurrence of heat waves, cold spells and vector-borne diseases (Chapters 2 and 5).
Nature and biodiversity are the basis for virtually all ecosystem services, including food and fibre provisioning, nutrient circulation and climate regulation — forests, for example, provide carbon sinks that help absorb greenhouse gas emissions (Chapter 3).

biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation directly affect climate change and undermines the way we are able to use natural resources.
In addition, loss of natural infrastructure has been shown to have various harmful effects on human health (Chapter 5).
The use of natural resources and the resulting pollution of air, water and soil put pressure on nature and biodiversity through, for example, eutrophication and acidification (Chapter 3).
Ultimately, the use of non-renewable natural resources, such as fossil fuels, is at the heart of the debate about climate change.
In addition, waste management is a key sector with regard to greenhouse gas emissions (Chapter 2).
How we use natural resources and dispose of wastes also links directly to several health aspects and contributes to the environmental burden of disease (Chapter 5).
Ultimately, environmental pressures that result from, for example, climate change, biodiversity loss, or the use of natural resources, are linked with people's wellbeing (Chapters 2 to 5).
Access to clean water and air are paramount to our health, but is often undermined by pollution and waste that result from human activities (Chapters 4 and 5).
Climate change puts additional pressure on air and water quality (Chapter 2), while biodiversity loss may undermine the ability of ecosystems to provide, for example, water purification and other health-related services (Chapter 3).
Many of the links described above and in the previous chapters are direct, i.e. changes in the state of one environmental issue can translate directly into pressures of another.
In addition, a number of indirect links occur with changes in one environmental issue resulting in feedbacks on another and vice versa.
Land use and land-cover changes exemplify such indirect links.
They can be seen to be both a driver and an impact, not only of climate change, but also of biodiversity loss and the use of natural resources.
Thus, any change in land use and land cover resulting, for example, from urbanisation or converting forests to agriculture, affects climate conditions by changing an area's carbon balance, as well as biodiversity by altering ecosystems.
Most of the changes in the state of the environment described here are ultimately driven by unsustainable consumption and production patterns.
These have resulted in unprecedented levels of greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of renewable
Box 6.1
Natural capital and ecosystem services
Natural capital and ecosystem services embrace many components.
Natural capital is the stock of natural resources from which goods can be extracted and the flows of ecosystem services maintained.
The stocks and flows rely on ecosystem structures and functions such as landscapes, soil, and biodiversity.
There are three main types of natural capital which require different approaches to managing them:
•non-renewable and exhaustable resources — fossil fuels, metals, etc.; •renewable but exhaustable resources — fish stocks, water, soil, etc.;•renewable and non-exhaustable resources — wind, waves, etc.
Natural capital provides several functions and services — it provides the sources of energy, food and materials; the sinks for wastes and pollution; the services of climate and water regulation, pollination; and the space for living and leisure.
Using natural capital often involves trade-offs between these functions and services.
For example, if it is too intensively used for emissions and waste it can lose its capacity to provide flows of goods and services: coastal waters that receive pollution and excess nutrients will not be able to support previous levels of fish stocks.

Soil degradation across Europe
Soil degradation is a major environmental concern with many dimensions, including:
•Soil erosion is the wearing away of the land surface by water and wind.
The main causes of soil erosion are inappropriate land management practices, deforestation, overgrazing, forest fires and construction activities.
Erosion rates are very sensitive to both climate and land use, as well as to detailed conservation practice at the field level.
Given the very slow rate of soil formation, any soil loss of more than 1 tonne per hectare per year can be considered as irreversible over a time span of 50–100 years.
Water erosion affects 115 million hectares (ha) of soil or 12 % of Europe's total land area, and wind erosion 42 million ha.
The Mediterranean region is the most affected.
•Soil sealing occurs when agricultural or other rural land is built on and all soil functions are lost.
On average, built-up areas take up around 4 % of the total area of Member States, but not all of this is actually sealed.
In the decade 1990–2000, the sealed area in the EU-15 increased by 6 %, and the demand for new construction sites for urban sprawl and for transport infrastructures is continuing to rise.
•Salinisation of soils results from human interventions such as inappropriate irrigation practices, use of salt-rich irrigation water and/or poor drainage conditions.
Elevated salt levels in soil limit its agro-ecological potential and represent a considerable ecological and socioeconomic threat to sustainable development.
Salinisation affects around 3.8 million ha in Europe.
The most affected areas are Campania in Italy and the Ebro Valley in Spain, but areas in Greece, Portugal, France and Slovakia are also affected.
•Desertification means land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities.
Droughts are also associated with or lead to an increased soil erosion risk.
Desertification is a problem in parts of the Mediterranean and central and eastern Europe.
•Soil contamination is a widespread problem in Europe.
The most frequent contaminants are heavy metals and mineral oil.
The number of sites where potentially polluting activities have taken place now stands at approximately 3 million (a).

The Water Framework Directive (WFD) (11) is the key policy approach aimed at tackling these challenges.
It sets ecological limits to human water use and management.
Furthermore, it obliges EU Member States and regional authorities to take coordinated measures regarding, for example, agriculture, energy, transport and housing, within the context of rural and urban spatial planning, while also taking biodiversity conservation concerns into account.
As noted already (Chapters 3 and 4), a first look at river basin management plans, shows that strong efforts are needed in the coming years to achieve good ecological status by 2015.
For the WFD to be successful, integrated management of river basins is crucial, involving relevant stakeholders in identifying and implementing spatially-differentiated measures that often involve trade-offs between different interests.
The management of flood risks, in particular the relocation of dykes and reestablishment of flood plains, requires integrated urban and land-use planning.
Linked yet competing issues: water-energy-food-climate
Water makes vital contributions to economic activities including agriculture and energy production, and as a key transport route.
As a connecting system it is also exposed to many different pressures and links the effects of some economic activities to others, for example agriculture via nutrient run-off to fishing.
Climate affects both the supply and demand for energy and water, and energy conversion and water extraction processes have the potential to contribute to climate change.
At the EU and national levels, there are different sectoral and environmental policies and measures that may conflict with water management and the objective of achieving a good ecological status of water bodies.
Examples are policies for bioenergy crops and hydro-energy, the promotion of irrigated agriculture, the development of tourism, and expanding inland waterway transport.
The Water Framework Directive provides options to develop integrated resource management at water basin level.
This could help strike a balance between wider policy objectives — for examples related to energy and agricultural production, or reducing greenhouse gas emissions — as well as the benefits and impacts on the ecological status of water bodies, adjacent land ecosystems and wetlands.

Polution, such as carbon dioxide emisions, is also counted as part of the footprint.
Biocapacity measures how biologicaly productive land is.
It is measured in 'global hectares': a hectare with the world average biocapacity.
Biologicaly productive land includes cropland, pasture, forests and fisheries (b).

Conversely — and in a global perspective — the conversion of forests and grasslands to agricultural land is one of the most important drivers for habitat loss and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

There is a two-way relationship between Europe and the rest of the world.

Conversely, in a highly interdependent world, changes in other parts of the world are increasingly felt closer to home, both directly through the impacts of global environmental changes, or indirectly through intensified socioeconomic pressures (1
Climate change is an obvious example.
Most of the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions is projected to occur outside Europe, as a result of increasing wealth in populous emerging economies.
In spite of successful efforts to reduce emissions and a decreasing share in the global total, European societies continue to be major emitters of greenhouse gases (Chapter 2).

Global sea-level rise and ocean acidification
During the 20th century, global sea level rose by an average of 1.7 mm/year.
This was due to an increase in the volume of ocean water as a consequence of temperature rise, although inflow of water from melting glaciers and ice sheets is playing an increasing role.
In the past 15 years, sea-level rise has been accelerating and averaged about 3.1 mm/year, based on data from satellites and tide gauges, with a significantly increasing contribution from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica.
Sea level is projected to rise considerably during this century and beyond.

Global extraction of natural resources from ecosystems and mines grew more or less steadily over the past 25 years, from 40 billion tonnes in 1980 to 58 billion tonnes in 2005.
Resource extraction is unevenly distributed across the world, with Asia accounting for the largest share in 2005 (48 % of total tonnage, compared with Europe's 13 %).
Over this period, a relative decoupling of global resource extraction and economic growth took place: resource extraction increased by roughly 50 % and world economic output (GDP) by about 110 % (16).

Links between environmental challenges are particularly apparent in Europe's direct neighbourhood
Europe's direct neighbourhood — the Arctic, the Mediterranean and the eastern neighbours — is worth particular attention here due to the strong socioeconomic and environmental links and the importance of these regions in EU external policy.
Furthermore, some of the world's largest reservoirs of natural resources are in these regions, which is of immediate relevance to a resource-scarce Europe.
These regions are also home to some of the world's richest and yet most fragile natural environments which are facing multiple threats.
At the same time, concerns remain related to many transboundary issues like water management and air pollution deposition shared between Europe and its neighbours.
Some of the main environmental challenges in these regions include:
The Arctic — European activities, such as those resulting in long-range emission of air pollution, black carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, leave a considerable footprint in the Arctic.
At the same time what happens in the Arctic also influences Europe's environment because the Arctic plays a key role, for example, in the context of climate change and related sea-level rise projections.
Furthermore, multiple pressures on Arctic ecosystems have resulted in biodiversity loss across the region.
Such changes have global repercussions because of the loss of key ecosystem
It focuses on the challenges posed by air and water pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, pressures on the marine and coastal environment, consumption and production patterns, and assesses sectoral developments that drive environmental change across the region.
The Mediterranean — Located at the crossroad of three continents this is one of the richest 'eco-regions' and yet one of the most vulnerable natural environments in the world.
The recent report on the State of the Environment and Development in the Mediterranean (28) presents the major impacts of climate change, the characteristics of the natural resources and environment in the region, and the challenges linked to their conservation.
In particular, some of the main pressures from human activities are identified (such as tourism, transport, and industry) and their impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems are assessed, together with considerations about their environmental sustainability.
While Europe is contributing directly and indirectly to some of the environmental pressures in these regions, it is also in an unique position to cooperate to improve their environmental conditions, particularly through fostering technology transfer and helping to build institutional capacity.
These dimensions are increasingly reflected in European neighbourhood policy priorities (29).
Environmental challenges are closely connected with global drivers of change
A range of unfolding trends are shaping the future European and global context, and many of these are outside the realm of Europe's direct influence.
Related global megatrends cut across social, technological, economic, political and even environment dimensions.
Key developments include changing demographic patterns or accelerating rates of urbanisation, ever faster technological changes, deepening market integration, evolving economic power shifts or the changing climate.
In 1960, the world's population was 3 billion. Today, it is about 6.8 billion.

In contrast to the global trend, European populations are expected to decline and age significantly.
In its neighbourhood, population decline is particularly dramatic in Russia and large parts of Europe.
At the same time, northern African countries along the southern Mediterranean are witnessing strong population growth.

But it could be water shortages that will hit hardest over the coming decades.
One estimate suggests that in just 20 years, global demand for water could be 40 % higher than today, and more than 50 % higher in the most rapidly developing countries (55).
Furthermore, according to a recent estimate prepared by the Secretariat of the Convention of Biological Diversity, the flow in more than 60 per cent of the large river systems in the world has been heavily altered.
Limits of ecological sustainability of water availability for abstraction have thus been reached, and up to 50 % of the world could be living in areas with high water stress by 2030, while more than 60% could still lack improved access to sanitation (56).

Already today, in many parts of the world, non-renewable resource use is close to its limit and potentially renewable resources are being used beyond their reproductive capacity.
This kind of dynamics can also be recognised in Europe's neighbouring regions with their comparatively rich natural capital.
Water resource over-exploitation, combined with insufficient access to safe drinking water and sanitation, for example, are critical challenges both in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean (35).
At the global level, poverty and social exclusion are further exacerbated by ecosystem degradation and changes in the climate.
Globally, efforts to alleviate extreme poverty were reasonably effective until the 1990s (51).
However, the recurring food and economic crises throughout 2006 to 2009 have magnified the trend of increasing under-nourishment rates around the world.
The number of undernourished rose, for the first time, to more than 1 billion in 2009 and the proportion of undernourished in developing countries, which was declining quite rapidly, has risen in the past few years.

pressures (
Many key drivers operate on a global scale and are likely to unfold over decades rather than years.
In a recent assessment, the World Economic Forum warned about a higher level of systemic risk due to the increase in interconnections among various risks (60).
Furthermore, the assessment emphasised that unexpected, sudden changes in external conditions are inevitable in a highly interlinked world.
While sudden changes can have huge impacts, the biggest risks may be from slow failures which unfold their full damage potential over decades and may be seriously underestimated in their potential economic impact and societal cost (60).
The continued over-exploitation of natural capital is an example for a slow failure.
Such systemic risks — whether they manifest themselves as sudden changes or slow failures — include the potential damage to, or even full failure of, an entire system, for example a market or an ecosystem, as opposed to effects on individual elements only.
The interconnectedness between drivers and risks highlighted here are relevant in this regard: while these links can lead to higher robustness when risk sharing is distributed across a greater number of elements in the system, they can also lead to greater fragility.
Failure in one critical link can have cascading effects, often as a consequence of

Future environmental priorities: some reflections
Unprecedented change, interconnected risks and increased vulnerabilities pose new challenges
The previous chapters highlight the fact that the world is experiencing environmental change and hence new challenges on a scale, speed and interconnectedness that are unprecedented.
Decades of intensive use of stocks of natural capital and ecosystem degradation by developed countries to fuel economic development have resulted in global warming, loss of biodiversity and various negative impacts on our health.
Even though many of the immediate impacts lie outside Europe's direct influence, they have significant consequences and will create potential risks for the resilience and sustainable development of the European economy and society.
Emerging and developing economies have in recent years replicated this trend but at a much faster speed driven by increasing populations, growing numbers of middle class consumers, and rapidly changing consumption patterns towards levels in developed countries; unprecedented financial flows chasing scarcer energy and raw materials; unparalleled shifts in economic power, growth, and trade patterns from advanced to emerging and developing economies; and, delocalisation of production driven by price competition.
Climate change is one of the most obvious effects of these past developments: breaching the 2 °C target is probably the most tangible example of the risk of going beyond planetary boundaries.
The long-term ambition of achieving 80 to 95 % reductions in CO
2 emissions by 2050 in Europe to stay in line with the above target, strongly argues for a fundamental transformation of Europe's current economy, with low-carbon energy and transport systems as central planks of the new economy — but not the only ones.
As in the past, future climate change impacts are expected to affect disproportionately the most vulnerable in society: children, the elderly, and the poor.
On the positive side, greater access to green
S y n the he si s iss spaces, biodiversity, clean water and air benefit people's health.
However, this too raises the question about the sharing of access and benefits, since often spatial planning and investment decisions favour the rich at the expense of the poor.
Well-maintained ecosystems and ecosystem services are essential to support climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, and preserving biodiversity is a prerequisite for ensuring this.
Balancing the role that ecosystems can play as a buffer against expected impacts with possible increased demands for new settlements on water and land, brings new challenges, for example, to spatial planners, architects and conservationists.
The ongoing race for substitution from carbon-intensive to low-carbon energy and materials is expected to further intensify demands on the terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems and services (first and second generation biofuels provide an example here).
As these demands increase, for example for chemical substitutes, there are likely to be increasing conflicts with existing uses for food, transport and leisure.
Sudden breakdowns in one area or geographical region can transmit large-scale failures through a whole network of economies, via contagion, feedbacks and other amplifications.
The recent global financial crash or the Icelandic
volcano episodes have demonstrated this (
Crises such as these have also shown how difficult it is for society to deal with risks. Well signposted and numerous early warnings
At the same time, recent times offer are often widely ignored ( many experiences, both good and bad, from which we can learn and so respond more quickly and more systematically to the challenges we face (for example, through multiple crisis management, climate negotiations, eco-innovations, information technologies, or global knowledge developments).
Natural capital and ecosystem services provide an integral starting point for managing many of these interconnected issues, the systemic risks inherent in them, and the transformation to a new, greener, more resource efficient economy.
There is no single 'quick fix' for the challenges that Europe faces.
Rather, as this report shows, there is a clear case for long-term, interconnected approaches to deal with them.
What this report also provides is evidence that existing European environmental policies present a robust basis on which to build new approaches that balance economic, social and environmental considerations.
Future actions can draw on a set of key principles that have been established at European level: the integration of environmental considerations into other measures; precaution and prevention; rectification of damage at source; and the polluter-pays principle.
Implementing and strengthening environmental protection provides multiple benefits
Full implementation of environmental policies in Europe remains paramount, as key targets are still to be met (Chapter 1).
However, it is clear that targets in one area can inadvertently, through unintended consequences, disrupt or counteract a target in another.
Synergies and co-benefits thus need to be sought throughout the process of developing impact assessments of policies in different domains, by using approaches that fully account for natural capital.
Past decades' environmental policy efforts have provided a wide array of social and economic benefits through regulations, standards and taxation.
These in turn have driven infrastructure and technological investments to mitigate against environment and human health risks, for example, by setting air and water pollution limits, creating product standards, and by building wastewater treatment plants, waste management infrastructures, drinking water systems, clean energy and transport systems.
Such policies have permitted the economy to grow well beyond what might otherwise have been feasible.
For example, without tightening
There are also ancillary benefits from combined implementation of environmental legislation.
For example, combining climate change mitigation and air pollution abatement legislation could deliver benefits in the order of EUR 10 billion per year through reductions in damage to public health and ecosystems (A) (11).
Environmental producer responsibility legislation (such as REACH (12), WEEE
)) has contributed to push multi-national companies, for example, to design production processes at global level that meet EU standards and so deliver benefits for consumers across the world.
In addition, EU legislation is often replicated in China, India, California and elsewhere, highlighting further the multiple benefits of well-designed policies in the globalised economy.
European countries have also invested substantially in monitoring and regular reporting of environmental pollutants and wastes.
They are beginning to use the best available information and communication technologies and sources to develop information flows from in-situ instruments to Earth observation with specialised sensors.
The development of near-real time data and regularly updated indicators help to improve governance by providing stronger evidence for early interventions and preventative actions, supporting greater levels of enforcement and enhancing overall performance reviews.
There is now no shortage of environmental and geographical data in Europe to support environmental objectives, and many opportunities exist to exploit these data through analytical methods and information technologies.
However, restrictions on access, charging fees or intellectual property rights have meant that these data are not always easily accessible to policymakers and others working in the field of environment.
There are a number of information policies and processes in place or being negotiated in Europe to support swifter responses to emerging challenges.
Rethinking their uses and links between them could radically improve the efficacy of existing and proposed information gathering and harvesting activities in support of policies.
Dedicated management of natural capital and ecosystem services increases social and economic resilience
The desire to make economic and social progress that does not come at the expense of the natural environment is not new.
Many European industries have decoupled emissions of key pollutants and the use of certain materials from economic growth.
What is new is that management of natural capital requires decoupling of economic growth not only from resource use but also from environmental impacts within Europe and globally.
Natural capital embraces many components.
It is the stock of natural resources from which ecosystems goods and services can be derived.
Such capital provides the sources of energy, food and materials; the sinks for wastes and pollution; the services of climate, water and soil regulation; and the environment for living and leisure — in essence, the core fabric of our societies.
Using it often involves trade-offs between different services and striking a balance between maintaining and using stocks.
Getting this balance right depends on appreciating the many linkages between natural capital and the other four types of capital that hold together our societies and economies (i.e. human, social, manufactured and financial capital).
The common features between such capitals, for example over-consumption and under-investment, indicate the potential of much more coherent action across policy domains (such as spatial planning, integration between economic sectors and environment considerations), deeper longer term approaches to knowledge that recognise many of these risks may emerge over many decades (such as scenario planning), and smart decisions on near-term actions that anticipate long-term needs and avoid technological lock-in (such as infrastructure investments) (19).
There are three main types of natural capital (Chapter 6) which require different policy measures to manage them.
In some cases, natural capital that is depleted can be substituted by other types of capital, such as non-renewable energy resources that are used to develop and invest in renewable energy sources.
However, more
Since the industrial revolution there has been a shift away from using renewable resources to non-renewables to fuel our economy.
Towards the end of the 20th century, non-renewables accounted for some 70 % of total material flows in industrialised countries compared to about 50 % in 1900 (20).
Europe relies heavily on the rest of the world for non-renewables, and increasingly some of these non-renewables — such as fossil fuels or rare earth metals used in information technology products — are becoming difficult to source cheaply, if at all, often for geopolitical as much as supply reasons.
Such trends make Europe vulnerable to external supply shocks that may result from an over-reliance on non-renewables.
Addressing this bias could be a key element in meeting the resource efficiency objective under the EU 2020 strategy (15).
A broader argument for shifting towards long-term development based on natural capital management is that today's poor governance of natural resources is forwarding risks to future generations.
Environmental impacts, as reflected by climate change, biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, have steadily built up as a result of decades of over-consumption and under-investment in maintenance and substitution of resources.
These impacts, often concentrated in developing countries, will be difficult to mitigate and adapt to.
Moreover, property rights for natural capital are often undefined, especially in developing countries, and the relative invisibility of natural capital degradation leads inter alia to passing on of accumulated 'debts' to future generations.
Ecosystem-based approaches offer coherent ways of managing the existing and expected demands for non-renewable and renewable resources in Europe and avoiding further over-exploitation of natural capital.
Particularly land and water resources offer viable entry points for strengthening integrated ecosystem-based approaches to resource management.
The Water Framework Directive, for example, has the aim of protecting ecosystems — aquatic and terrestrial — at its core.
Approaches that recognise the multifunctional benefits of ecosystems are central to proposals for post-2010 biodiversity policies and gaining traction in the marine, maritime, agriculture and forestry sectors.
As integrated management of natural resources becomes more prominent, competing demand for resources increasingly requires trade-offs.
This creates a need for accounting techniques — including, in particular, comprehensive accounting of land and water resources — that make transparent the full costs and benefits of ecosystem use and maintenance.
The information tools and accounting approaches to support integrated natural capital and ecosystem services management, including their relationship to sectoral activities, are not yet part of the standard administrative and statistical systems.
Much can still be gained from asking new questions of existing accounts, for example, on the true benefits to society of nature derived from agriculture, fishing and forestry which currently account for 3 % of EU GDP (as far as priced) but produce benefits many times that across the economy.
In addition, the identification of critical thresholds in resource use and the development of ecosystem accounts, ecosystem service indicators and ecosystem assessments are ongoing in Europe and globally.
Examples of such initiatives are The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), the revision of Integrated Environmental and
Economic Accounting (SEEA) by the United Nations (21) (22), the European Strategy for Environmental Accounting (23), and ecosystem accounting work at EEA.
More integrated actions across policy domains can help in greening the economy
Environmental policies have primarily influenced production processes and protected human health.
They therefore only partly address today's systemic risks.
This is because many of the causes of environmental problems, such as over-use of the land and oceans, are overwhelming the progress being made (Chapter 1).
Such causes often originate from multiple sources and economic activities that compete for short-term benefits from resource exploitation.
Reducing them will require cooperation across several domains to deliver coherent, cost-effective outcomes that address the trade-offs inherent in maintaining capitals in line with society's values and long-term interests, and contribute to greening the economy.
S y n the he si s iss maximise benefits and avoid unintended consequences.
Examples of achieving such coherence include:
Resource efficiency, public goods and ecosystem management� Building on established and emerging practice around ecosystem management in environment and sectoral policies to ensure the long-term viability and efficient use of renewable resources by the main sectors (i.e. agriculture, forestry, transport, industry, fisheries, maritime).
Agriculture, forestry, maritime, green infrastructure and territorial cohesion� Developing green infrastructure and ecological networks on land and at sea to secure the long-term resilience of Europe's terrestrial and marine ecosystems, the goods and services provided by them and their distributional benefits.
Sustainable production, intellectual property rights, trade and aid� Implementing existing product standards and patents for innovation that accelerate substitution out of scarce and insecure non-renewable resources, reduce Europe's trade footprint, promote recycling potential, improve Europe's competitiveness and contribute to welfare improvements worldwide.
Sustainable consumption, food, housing and mobility� Bringing together the three areas of consumption that together contribute more than two-thirds of major worldwide life-cycle environmental pressures from consumption in Europe.
More coherent polices across multiple sources of environmental pressures are already emerging in recognition of inter-linkages and aimed at developing cost-efficient solutions.
For example, the links between climate mitigation, reduced reliance on fossil fuels, substitution by renewables, energy efficiency and multi-sectoral energy needs underpin the design of the EU Climate and Energy package.
This marks a key difference compared to the situation 15 to 20 years ago and provides precedent for more effective collaboration between sectoral and environmental interests.
S y n the he si s iss gains from investments in green technologies.
For example, investment in energy efficiency and renewable energies delivers benefits to the environment, employment, energy security, energy costs, and can help combat fuel poverty.
The polluter pays principle can stimulate a greening of the economy through taxes that allow market prices to reflect full costs of production, consumption and wastes.
This can be achieved via greater use of fiscal reform which in addition to removing harmful subsidies, replaces distortionary taxes on economic 'goods' such as labour and capital, with more efficient taxes on economic 'bads', such as pollution and inefficient resource use (27).
In a broader perspective, 'prices' as a facilitator of trade-offs can help improve further progress in sectoral integration and resource efficiency but more fundamentally shift behaviours across governments, businesses and citizens in Europe and globally.
However, for this to happen — as known for decades, but rarely applied — prices need to reflect the true economic, environmental and social value of resources, relative to available substitutes.
Evidence of the benefits of fiscal reform has grown in recent years.
Such benefits include environmental improvements, employment gains, a stimulus to eco-innovation and more efficient tax systems.
Studies show the benefits from modest environmental tax reform in several European countries that have been implemented over the last 20 years.
Similarly, they convincingly demonstrate the advantages of additional reforms designed to achieve the EU climate and resource
efficiency goals (
The revenues from environmental taxes vary significantly across EU Member States, from more than 5 % of GDP in Denmark to less than 2 % in Spain, Lithuania, Romania, and Latvia in 2008 (34).
Despite the large benefits of such taxes, and consistent policy support over the last 20 years from OECD and the EU, environmental tax revenues as a proportion of overall tax revenues in the EU are at their lowest level in more than a decade, even if the number of environmental taxes is increasing.
Accounting fully for natural capital will also require new classifications, ideally linked to existing ones as described in the statistical frameworks and system of national accounts (SNA).
Important examples are emerging, for example in the area of ecosystem services (35) or carbon accounting and carbon crediting.
In addition, a new information environment will have to address the widespread lack of accountability and transparency, and the loss of trust amongst citizens in governments, science and business.
The challenge now is to improve the knowledge base in order to support more accountable and participatory decision making.
Providing access to information is essential for effective governance; but engaging people in collecting data and sharing their lay knowledge is
arguably just as important (
A further reflection concerns equipping Europeans with the skills to make the transformation to a green economy.
Education, research and industrial policy have roles to play here by providing the next generation of materials, technologies, processes and indicators (for example related to systemic risks and vulnerabilities) that help reduce Europe's dependencies, increase resource efficiencies and enhance economic competitiveness in line with the EU 2020 strategy (15).
Other factors include incentives for businesses using new financial mechanisms, retraining existing workers to contribute to green industries, and deploying unskilled workers displaced by delocalised production.
A good example is the European recycling industry which holds a 50 % global market and has been increasing employment by some 10 % annually, mostly for unskilled workers (39).
More generally, many multi-national businesses are also responding to the natural capital challenge, recognising that the future economy
40 must have the means to manage, value and trade such capital (
There is scope to foster further the role of small and medium enterprises in natural capital management.

List of graphs
EEA Signals are annual reports covering a broad range of topics.
They are typically built around 20–30 pages of indicator-based assessment wri�en in non-technical language for a broad audience with graphics to support the text.
They are translated into all EEA languages.
The key messages in this year's report highlight the need to make further progress in managing the environmental impacts of agriculture, transport and energy.
This can be achieved by further increasing the use of market-based instruments to manage demand and internalise external costs (e.g. for transport), by switching more extensively to positive subsidies (e.g. for agriculture) and by promoting innovation (e.g. for renewable energies).
Similar instruments can also help deal with unsustainable trends in waste generation.
The spin-off benefits for the environment and human health will be multi-dimensional across issues such as climate change, air pollution, biodiversity and water quality.
The major events in Europe's environment during 2003 were weather- and climaterelated.
The hot summer claimed possibly as many as 35 000 lives, mainly in southern Europe.
Ozone pollution levels were especially high, while unusually low water flows were recorded in the Danube, Rhine and other major rivers, in sharp contrast with the heavy flooding the summer before.
The summer 2003 forest fires claimed lives and cost some EUR 925 million in Portugal alone.
It is estimated that in Europe around three quarters of economic losses caused by catastrophic events result from weather- and climate-related events.
A very conservative estimate of the annual average bill is about EUR 10 billion and rising.
These figures suggest that managing Europe's natural resources is increasingly important for ensuring the viability of Europe's economic and social capital.
In general, environmental data are improving but they remain inadequate to meet the task of monitoring changes.
For example, water quality data need to become more statistically representative at catchment level, while air quality monitoring for small particles (PM
) needs strengthening in urban areas. Waste data are very
5 patchy and generally suffer from definitional problems although packaging waste is relatively well documented.
Climate change impacts data, as presented here on temperature, glaciers and flowering season length, are robust and scientifically collected over long time scales.
The timeliness of all data needs to be improved.
The European Environment Agency is working to improve data by ensuring there is complete coverage over time for all member countries and that data delivered are as accurate as possible.
Work continues to improve indicator methodologies, focusing primarily on the EEA core set of indicators (www.eea.eu.int/coreset).
The set will be reviewed regularly and gradually expanded to cover issues not well addressed at present, such as resource use, health and chemicals.
In addition, to meet the needs of citizens and policy-makers across Europe most effectively, the EEA will continue to develop more integrated indicators that combine the environmental, economic and social dimensions as well as the territorial dimension.
Professor Jacqueline McGlade Executive Director
Europe in 2004: An environmental perspective
Europe's environment should be considered in the context of socio-economic agendas, such as the Lisbon process and sustainable development, that also have a strong global dimension.
In March 2000 the Lisbon European Council set a new strategic goal (1) for Europe.
This was subsequently complemented in Gothenburg in June 2001 with a strategy for sustainable development, the addition of the environmental dimension to the Lisbon objectives and the
The main barriers to progress in environmental protection and sustainability are the complex, inter-sectoral, inter-disciplinary and international nature of both the problems and the solutions.
These barriers are underpinned by shortcomings in institutional structures, non-implementation of commitments already made (see European Council conclusions, 25–26 March 2004) and lack of information on and understanding of possible 'win-win-win' solutions for achieving sustainable outcomes.
Such solutions embrace competitiveness and innovation, social cohesion, territorial cohesion and the protection and maintenance of scarce natural resources and valuable ecosystems.
The European Union is the second largest economy behind the United States, with a vast array of assets and a lead part to play in global governance.
The Lisbon economic agenda aims to deliver higher growth and more and be�er jobs, but progress towards its objectives is mixed.
Economic growth (in terms of gross domestic product) in the 15 older EU Member States was 27 % between 1990 and 2002, compared with 41 % in the United States.
Employment growth in these Member States has also lagged behind the United States since 1990, but labour productivity has been more closely aligned.
Competitiveness and innovation are defining conditions for growth to deliver sustainable outcomes for Europe's economy, society and environment.
Europe's competitiveness is being driven by a handful of countries and 'super-regions', according to the 2004 European Competitiveness Index (The European Competitiveness Index 2004, Robert Huggins Associates, h�p://www.hugginsassociates.com).
In the future, ambitious regions in the new EU Member States are expected to overtake the least competitive among the older Member States.
At country level Denmark and Luxembourg head the competitiveness league among the older Member States, while Uusimaa in Finland and Stockholm head the regional index and are also the only regions in the European Union to feature in the 2002 world competitiveness index.
Norway and Switzerland also perform well.
The extent of knowledge creation and the utilisation of human capital distinguish the competitive performers from the less competitive.
Many of these countries and regions also perform relatively well on environmental issues, indicating that economic and environmental goals can be achieved together.
Reducing regional disparities, the main goal of the European Union's cohesion policy, is expected to further enhance 'be�er' growth (see European Commission 3rd Cohesion Report, February 2004).
Be�er growth also means improved resource productivity.
There was a slight increase per capita in the use of materials in the European Union economy between 1980 and 2000.
EEA Signals 2004 product grew much more strongly (by 56 %), indicating that there has been a relative decoupling of resource use from economic growth, driven in part by technological innovation.
Europe leads on environmental technology innovations, for example on more sustainable manufacturing materials and processes, renewable energies and waste treatment practices.
Research is key to maintaining progress.
The coherence and targeting of research resources could be improved and much more can be done to exploit fully the potential of what already exists by dealing with institutional and political barriers to progress.
There is also a lot to be achieved by promoting the use of venture capital in embryo niche markets.
Social changes in Europe are being driven by enlargement, demographic changes and globalisation.
These in turn are influencing consumption pa�erns and spatial planning decisions, with transport in particular playing an increasingly pivotal role in the economy and people's lives.
Wealth per capita differs substantially between the west and east of the European Union.
The now enlarged Union has 20 % more population and 25 % more territory.
Around three-quarters of the population live on only 15 % of the land area (3) and present trends of urban agglomeration in the industrial regions of northern France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are expected to continue into the future.
The pressures on urban agglomerations across Europe are expected to increase further as people seek to improve their living standards by moving to where the employment opportunities are greatest.
These trends will increase pressure on existing urban infrastructure and services but will also create opportunities for building more sustainable cities that accommodate economic, social and environmental aspirations.
In this evolving context, Europe's population is expected to increase until about 2020, a�er which it will stabilise and then decline.
However the working-age population (those aged 15–64) is expected to start falling a few years earlier, from 2010, with consequences for sustaining employment and innovation.
In parallel, there will be a marked increase in older persons (aged 65 and over).
The consumption demand pa�erns of older people tend to shi� towards services such as social and leisure activities, including tourism, with consequent environmental impacts.
So, for example, the explosive increase in air travel, which is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions, reflects in part these changes in demography.
While Europe's population stabilises and ages, the number of households will increase at a more rapid rate.
In the European Union the number grew by 11 % between 1990 and 2000 (4) and is expected to continue rising.
The majority of new households will be small, reflecting social and lifestyle changes such as increasing numbers of single and divorced people.
Smaller households tend to be less efficient, requiring more resources per capita (5) than larger households.
The trend towards smaller households also increases the pressure on land and acts as a factor driving the expansion of built-up areas.
Over 80 % of Europeans (6) are expected to live in urban areas by 2020.
Europe's rural population, in turn, is declining and this long-observed trend is expected to continue (7).
Rural depopulation o�en results in the abandonment of farmland, a trend that is of particular threat to areas of high nature conservation value (8).
Semi-natural and extensively farmed areas are very vulnerable to changes in land management such as the cessation of grazing and mowing, which contribute to the maintenance of high biological diversity in these areas.
Population growth
Energy consumption and gross domestic product
Energy consumption is rising, but more slowly than gross domestic product (GDP).
Between 1995 and 2001, energy consumption rose by 7 % while GDP increased by 16 %.
The continued potential for saving energy is widely recognised.
In the energy supply sector the opportunities for improvement focus in the short term on further switching to more efficient natural gas-powered production, and in the longer term on increasing use of combined heat and power and decentralising electricity generation.

These farming practices are o�en also the most marginal and are therefore economically vulnerable to rising prices and greater competition.
The management of Europe's environment and its natural capital are important to ensure the longterm viability of its economic and social capital.
So, for example, demographic and socio-economic trends are playing a role in increasing society's exposure to weather- and climate-related damage through factors such as housing developments in areas vulnerable to flooding and other risks.
It is estimated that in Europe around three-quarters of economic losses caused by catastrophic events are weather- or climaterelated.
A very conservative estimate of the average annual bill is about EUR 10 billion and rising.
Energy consumption is still increasing, a major concern in the context of climate impacts.
In particular the domestic sector's demand for electricity and transport are rising in line with increasing wealth and the growing number of smaller households.
End-of-pipe technology has reduced air pollutant emissions from power generation, but as the possibilities are narrowing for some key lowcarbon technologies, such as largescale hydro-electric power, other options need to be explored.
These could include reducing demand by implementing energy efficiency measures, for which there is huge potential; reducing the barriers to, and improving the incentives for, the uptake of renewable technologies; rethinking options for transport; and increasing funding for research into alternative technologies.
Trends in waste generation, a proxy for resource use intensity, are unsustainable.
Treatment and disposal options are diminishing as quantities increase and concerns about their potential impacts grow.
Decisions on the location of incinerators have become very controversial in many countries.
Landfill options are o�en limited by space as well as by fears of soil and groundwater contamination and their impacts on human health.
The current policy tools for dealing with waste are inadequate and need to be complemented by approaches that promote smarter resource use by changing production and consumption pa�erns and through innovation.
Subsequent chapters provide further insight into these and other issues relevant to the environment and in particular the main sectoral activities that have most impact — agriculture, transport and energy.
Built-up land area
Total population
Built-up areas are spreading across Europe and increasing much faster than the population.
Most new areas have been created at the expense of agricultural land, but are also encroaching on forested land.
Further expansion is likely to be caused by factors such as decreasing household size, which increases the number of households; growing demand for roads; and the depopulation of rural areas, leading to an influx of people into already built-up urban areas.
Built-up areas have a heavy impact on soil function: where the topsoil is taken off during construction, removing the built surface would not restore the soil to a useful resource.
This has implications for soil as a resource for future generations.
Direct material consumption
(Index,1980=100)
Direct material consumption (DMC) is a measure of the materials used by the economy.
Non-renewable materials dominate DMC: their share was fairly constant at around 75 % between 1980 and 2000.
Of these, construction minerals make up the largest share, accounting for more than 40 %.
0 The urban population is increasing.
It is forecast that 80 % of Europeans will be living in urban areas by 2020, and in seven countries the proportion will be 90 % or more.
The pressures of extensive urban development (urban sprawl) are closely coupled with issues of transport and consumption.
Urban sprawl can also lead to economic segregation, seen in areas of inner-city dereliction and extensive peripheral estates, o�en with sub-standard housing.
Urban expansion can also place pressure on inner city and urban green areas, which may be vulnerable to fragmentation and conversion unless adequately protected by planning guidelines.
The new Member States contain considerable areas of semi-natural habitats and associated species of conservation interest, but many of these areas are threatened by intensification (10) or land abandonment.
Current rural development spending in Member States is not sufficiently targeted at biodiversity-rich areas.
Europe's countryside has been shaped by agriculture over centuries and much of Europe's biodiversity depends in some way on farmland.
European agriculture is still very diverse, ranging from intensively farmed monocultures that put heavy pressure on the environment to extensively farmed semi-natural areas creating much less pressure.
Protecting valuable farmland is important for halting the loss of biodiversity.
However, by 2003 the sites designated by
The common agricultural policy accounts for about 50 % of the total European Union budget and influences how farmers manage their land and livestock.
Past subsidies encouraged intensive agricultural production by paying per tonne of wheat or per head of livestock produced.
Since the early 1990s, however, income support payments have taken over and more rural development measures have been introduced, including important measures for the environment such as agrienvironment schemes and support for less favoured areas.
These help to fund the protection of high nature value farmlands, underpinning the activities of the LIFE (Nature) programme.
Increased support for these farmland areas is needed as declining prices for agricultural produce are driving many farmers either to increase production efficiency, leading to intensification and specialisation of farms, or to stop farming.
Both these trends have negative environmental consequences, especially on biodiversity.
The share of rural development measures in the common agricultural policy budget has increased since 1990 and accounted for 13 % (equivalent to EUR 53 per hectare) in 2000–2002.
Under their accession agreement the proportion of rural development spending in the ten new Member States is much higher than for the older Member States, at around half of total spending (equivalent to EUR 45 per hectare) between 2004 and 2006 (12).
In absolute terms, however, the level of rural development spending is similar.
As well as taking a higher share of the total agricultural budget it is important that rural development expenditure, and in particular the agrienvironment schemes, is properly targeted at areas of high biodiversity.
Rural development spending
The share of the rural development budget in total common agricultural policy (CAP) spending has risen slowly since 1991: for EU-15 it averaged 9 % (EUR 22 per hectare) between 1991 and 1993, rising to 13 % (EUR 53 per hectare) in 2000–2002.
Some 30–40 % of rural development funding is used for agrienvironment schemes but levels of spending vary widely between countries.
Spain and Greece, for example, spent around EUR 4 per hectare on agri-environmental schemes in 2000–2002 while in Finland and Austria the figure was around EUR 80 per hectare.
More than 70 % of farming area in Finland and Austria is covered by agri- environment schemes but only about 5 % in Spain and Greece.

Bird populations
Farmland bird populations have fallen substantially in recent decades.
These data start in 1980 but it is probable that rapid decline also occurred in the 1970s.
Farmland bird populations have not fallen as much in the New-10 and CC-3 as in the EU-15, largely because of the lower intensity of farming in central and eastern Europe.
Wetland birds are migratory: their numbers o�en fluctuate in line with temperature, with fewer arriving in cold years.
Wetland birds are also affected by hunting and eutrophication of wetlands.
Time (years)
Organic farming area
Organic farming does not use chemical fertilisers and pesticides.
It relies instead on animal manure, crop rotation and appropriate soil cultivation practices for building up soil fertility and combating pests and plant diseases.
Organic agriculture has lower yields than conventional farming systems but reduces the risk of nitrate pollution of water and generally promotes more wildlife.
The share of organic land remains far below 1 % in most of the New-10 and the CC-3 due to li�le or no state support and low consumer demand for organic products.
Across the EEA-31 as a whole, however, organic farming area increased by around four fi�hs between 1997 and 2000, to 4.4 million hectares from 2.4 million.

Water pollution: Managing nitrate
Diffuse pollution from agricultural land is still the main source of nitrate in water.
Nitrates continue to damage the environment, contributing to eutrophication in coastal and marine waters and pollution of drinking water, especially where groundwaters have become contaminated.
Member States' success in tackling nitrate pollution has been mixed.
Nitrate pollution is caused mainly by agriculture.
Unless fertiliser and manure are absorbed by crops or removed during harvesting, excess nitrate can be washed into groundwater as well as surface water bodies (13).
Measures to reduce nitrate pollution can be effective however.
The greatest improvements have occurred in Denmark, which began a national nitrogen management programme in the late 1980s.
This combines advice to farmers with the allocation of an annual nitrogen 'budget' to each farm, enforced through regular field checks.
Substantial time lags can occur before changes in agricultural practices are reflected in groundwater quality, depending on the soil type and the specific hydrogeological conditions of the groundwater body and overlying substrate.
As groundwater ranges in age from decades to millennia (although groundwater used for drinking water is on average 40 years old), current practices are in effect leaving a legacy of groundwater pollution for coming generations.
Around one third of groundwater bodies (14) now exceed nitrate guideline values.
The cost of nitrate reduction lies in the range of EUR 50-150 per hectare per year (15), but this is estimated to be 5 to 10 times cheaper than removing
UK drinking water costs £19 million a year and projects the total UK cost of achieving the European Union nitrate standard for potable water (17) at £199 million over the next 20 years (18).
Consumers, rather than the polluters (i.e. farmers), pay almost all of the bill.
Agricultural practices are currently less intensive in the ten new EU Member States than in the 15 older ones.
However, if farming becomes more intensive in the new Member States, as predicted, nitrate concentrations in surface and ground waters could increase.
Good implementation of the European Union nitrates directive, supported by additional measures as necessary, will be essential to avoid creating an extensive, long-lived and costly pollution problem in these countries over the coming years.
Arable land in upstream catchments
0 0 < 10 > 50 Nitrate concentrations in rivers are linked to the proportion of arable land in the upstream catchment: highest levels occur where large amounts of nitrogenous fertilisers and animal manure are used.
In 2001, nitrate levels in rivers where arable land covers more than 50 % of the upstream catchment area were three times higher than in catchments with arable land cover of less than 10 %.
Member States are required to designate nitrate vulnerable zones and implement programmes of measures to reach the EU nitrates directive's objective of reducing water pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources.
Arable land cover (% of total upstream catchment)
Nitrate concentrations in rivers
Nitrate pollution of groundwater appears stable at the European level.
However, when the data are broken down by country, 24 % (out of 142) individual groundwater bodies show decreasing nitrate concentrations while in 19 % concentrations are increasing.
Increases may either reflect the time-lag between changes in agricultural practices and their effects on groundwater quality or show a need for additional measures.

Nature: Maximising the value of protected areas
Designating sites to protect threatened species and habitats has long been a core element of biological diversity policy but conflicting pressures on available land are now making it more difficult to establish new sites.
The future of nature protection lies in integrating biodiversity considerations into sectoral and environmental policies and maximising the utility of existing protected sites.
More needs to be done to protect marine biodiversity.
Since the 1970s, the number of national sites has increased substantially as countries have progressively implemented national laws on nature protection.
International and European Union instruments have also made it compulsory for countries to designate sites for protection (19).
As a result there are now nearly 600 different categories of protection and more than 42 000 individual protected sites in the European Environment Agency's 31 member countries.
By the end of 2003, sites designated as special protection areas under the birds directive or proposed as sites of Community interest under the habitats directive covered around 15 % of the territory of the European Union.
Additionally, marine protected areas have been created in all of the regional seas and on the coasts of many European countries.
However, there remain substantial gaps in the protection of marine and coastal areas.
Marine areas should be protected according to the richness of their biodiversity, but this protection may conflict with other uses including shipping or fishing.
Agreeing on an appropriate level of protection and then enforcing it is therefore o�en difficult.
Protected areas cannot be sustained in isolation from the communities and economic activities in and around them (20).
To maximise their value, protected areas need to be integrated into wider landscape uses and be connected to other areas of similar qualities.
Connecting sites ensures that species have the possibility to survive by moving in response to disturbances and climate change.
The Natura 2000 network can play a role in achieving such integration.
There is now less scope for designating new sites as protecting biodiversity competes with growing and conflicting pressures on available land.
Policies will increasingly have to deal with this by maximising the value of areas already protected and by integrating biodiversity concerns into sectoral policies (e.g. agri-environmental measures or sustainable forestry policies) as well as into other environmental policies.
Implementation of the habitats directive
As of November 2003, more than 80 % of the habitats and species listed in the EU habitats directive were sufficiently (21) covered by sites in r e
United Kingdom
Fish catches above safe limits
Catches outside safe limits Catches within safe limits
0 Overall 60 % of European fish catches exceed safe limits, i.e. levels above which the biomass removed by fishing is no longer replaced by population growth.
Catches of open sea fish account for almost two thirds of all catches; about half of these catches are outside safe limits.
Industrial fishing catches account for another 20 % of the total.
Fish play an integral role within the wider marine environment, which is experiencing pressures from shipping, pollution, coastal eutrophication and climate change.
The continuation of present trends of over-fishing will therefore probably lead to substantial changes across the entire marine ecosystem.
Sprat, sand eel(industrial fish)
Zooplankton abundance
Cold water species
The past decade has seen a marked change in the relative abundance of zooplankton in the North Sea.
The warm-water copepod Calanus helgolandicus has become more than twice as abundant as the cold-water species Calanus finmarchicus.
These data are illustrative of a general trend for zooplankton populations to shi� northwards in response to changing climatic conditions.
The composition of the marine ecosystem has been changing since the mid 1980s in the North Sea, a trend that directly affects fish populations and consequently fisheries.
Projections show that global warming will increasingly change the composition of the ecosystems in the oceans and cause a shi� by warm-water species towards higher latitudes.
Packaging waste: Still increasing
Prevention has long been the highest priority of European Union waste policy: only where the production of waste is unavoidable should recycling and reuse of waste be encouraged.
Yet Europe has made li�le progress in preventing packaging waste.
While many countries have met the targets for recycling set under the 1994 packaging waste directive, the amount of packaging waste is still increasing.
Data suggest overall volumes of waste are continuing to grow in Europe.
Total waste is made up of several waste streams.
The largest is construction and demolition waste, but packaging waste is the best documented in terms of quantities produced and treated.
The generation of packaging waste is closely coupled to economic growth and consumption pa�erns.
From 1997 to 2001 the amount of packaging waste increased in 10 of the 15 older EU Member States, and by 7 % in the then European Union as a whole.
Preliminary projections suggest that volumes of packaging waste are likely to continue rising substantially in the future (22).
Some of this increase is a�ributable to the proportionately higher generation of packaging waste from small households, but also to the growth of the internal market and the consequently greater need to transport packaged goods.
With rising emphasis on health and food safety, the amount of food packaging has also been increasing.
The European Union Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC) addresses the elements of packaging waste management in a general way while placing emphasis on recycling and recovery by se�ing quantitative targets for both.
An initial analysis (23)suggests that for some countries (e.g. Italy and Ireland) the directive has had a positive impact on the implementation of packaging waste management systems.
For certain countries with high recycling and recovery rates (e.g. Denmark and Austria) (24), however, the legislation has had li�le influence since their waste management systems were in place before it entered into force.
In general, countries that have implemented a mix of instruments have been most effective in meeting their objectives and targets.
The directive was amended in January 2004 but as it contains no waste prevention targets it can have only an indirect effect on the prevention of packaging waste.
The soundness of recycling as a strategy for smarter resource use has recently been questioned (25), but recycling is in most cases be�er for the environment than either energy recovery or disposal.
As the cost of recycling rises with the percentage of material recycled however, a comparison of the costs (including external costs) of alternative options is likely to limit the scope for raising recycling targets continually.
Generating less waste in the first place must remain the foremost objective.
Packaging waste generation
Between 1997 and 2001 total packaging waste increased by 7 % in the EU-15.
Over the year 2000–2001 the overall amount dipped slightly, mainly due to a 12 % decrease in Spain, but it is too early to tell whether this signals a change in the upward trend.
Packaging waste quantities vary substantially between countries, most likely due to different calculation methodologies.
In particular some countries report only on the four key materials for which Member States are required to provide data — plastic, glass, metal and paper.
Others report on all packaging including wood, which substantially increases the total weight recorded.
The main forms of recovery are recycling and incineration to produce energy.
The use of incineration is high in some countries e.g. Denmark and the Netherlands, while in others, e.g. Germany and Austria, more recycling is used.
The revised directive, adopted in January 2004, will effectively restrict the scope for incineration and other recovery methods except recycling.
In some countries this will require substantial changes to the collection and sorting of wastes.
The directive's targets are to be met by the end of 2008.
Several countries, in particular the New-10, are still a long way from meeting this. Some, including Estonia, Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta, Poland and Slovakia, but also Ireland, will need to more than double the proportion they recycled in 2002.
* Extension of deadline and lower targets
Sustainable energy: A long way to go
Total energy consumption continues to increase rapidly, making it difficult for Europe to reach its objectives on climate change.
If exploited more fully, energy efficiency and renewable energy sources could make a major contribution to a more sustainable energy system.
Achieving this will require deep changes throughout the economy.
Total energy consumption in the 25 Member States has been rising since the mid-1990s and this trend is expected to continue.
Burning fossil fuels, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions, is predicted to remain the largest energy source in Europe for the next 30 years.
Despite some growth in absolute terms renewable energy is not expected to raise its share significantly, while the contribution of nuclear power is projected to decline as a result of moratoria and phase-out policies in several countries.
The transition to sustainable energy will require substantial increases in energy savings, energy efficiency and renewable energy production across all sectors.
Substantial growth in renewable energy is needed to meet European and national targets for 2010 and will require further support.
Creating favourable conditions for renewables is a key requirement for increasing their market share.
A portfolio of diverse policy measures is needed, including se�ing policy targets beyond 2010 to provide longterm investment security; implementing support schemes; and ge�ing the prices right by fully including external costs in energy prices (e.g. by removing environmentally harmful subsidies).
Increased support for renewables will drive innovation and new technologies.
The recently proposed energy services directive (26) is another step in the right direction.
It aims to lower energy consumption by se�ing mandatory targets for Member States to save 1 % per year of energy supplied between 2006 and
It is estimated that the potential exists today to improve energy efficiency in cost-effective ways by at least 20 % in the 15 older EU Member States and by even more in the ten new ones.
This potential needs to be realised to move Europe further towards a sustainable energy future.

Transport: Full-cost pricing needed
Demand for transport, especially road transport, is growing rapidly.
This increase has implications across many areas, including energy consumption, climate change and human health.
Decoupling transport demand from economic growth has been a key aim of EU transport policy for several years but has yet to show results.
Freight volumes are growing faster than the economy (at around 3 % a year compared with 2 %, for the 15 older EU Member States) (31).
This largely reflects the pan-European production and consumption pa�erns that are accompanying the expansion of the EU internal market.
Passenger transport is increasing at the same rate as the economy.
Air transport is growing by 6–9 % per year in both the old and new EU Member States.
At the same time the market shares of modes such as rail and buses are increasing only marginally, if at all.
Options for managing the environmental impacts of transport include adjusting prices to account fully for its external costs and promoting innovation through improved regulation and financial incentives.
Adjusting policy so that the market share taken by each transport mode reflects its environmental impacts would mean establishing a closer link between the prices paid by users and the total internal and external costs of transport.
Prices are an important factor for steering demand in a market economy, and in the case of transport both the level and the structure of user prices are relevant.
Regulations to deal with issues such as air pollution (e.g. particulates) and noise, together with investment incentives, can drive innovation towards cleaner, safer and quieter transport.
This would in turn help reduce external costs.
There is clear agreement that transport prices do not fully cover the external costs caused by transport activities, although consensus is lacking on the exact figure to be paid.
Contrary to intentions, variable charges for road freight were actually reduced between 1998 and 2001.
The most important variable element is taxation on fuel, but fuel prices have remained within the same price range for more than 20 years.
Implementing full-cost pricing could help reduce environmental impacts in the same way as regulating air pollutants has led to substantial decreases in the regulated emissions.
Transport growth and gross domestic product
There has been no success in decoupling transport demand from economic growth, either for freight or passenger transport.
At around 3 % a year, freight transport is increasing faster than gross domestic product (GDP), which is growing at around 2 % annually.
Passenger transport is increasing at the same rate as GDP.
The reasons are complex but largely linked to socio-economic factors such as the expansion of the EU internal market, which is driving the rise in freight transport.
For passenger transport, the reasons include increased car use for commuting, leisure and tourism.
Ozone precursors***Acidifying substances**** ns po rt emissions of air pollutants a rT
Carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise as transport demand outstrips improvements in energy-related emissions.
Reductions for particulates (24 %), carbon monoxide (46 %), nitrogen oxides (24 %), volatile organic compounds (47 %) and lead (100 %) come partly from innovations in exhaust gas treatment technology and partly from changes in fuel composition.
Further improvements will take place as even stricter regulations come into force in the coming years and as older vehicles are replaced with newer ones.
Sulphur dioxide is a different case: large reductions in road transport emissions (61 %) have been offset by a similar increase in emissions from international maritime transport.
Thus in effect the exposure of people to sulphur dioxide has been reduced but not the overall emissions.
Progress with distance-related charges for heavy goods vehicles on highways
United Kingdom
The value of variable charges for goods transport on roads decreased in many EU Member States between 1998 and 2001.
In overall terms, variable charges in EU-15 fell by 7 % in this period.
This is partly a result of the protests in September 2000 by freight transport companies, farmers and fishermen against rising fuel prices.
The diesel tax is still the most important instrument in value terms.
In addition several EU countries, e.g. Germany, Austria and the UK, plan to introduce distance-based charges.
These will help to reduce road transport's net external costs to the environment.

Air pollution: Damaging health in cities
High concentrations of groundlevel ozone and fine particulates are causing human health problems in cities.
Despite reductions in emissions, much of Europe's urban population remains exposed to concentrations of these pollutants exceeding the levels set to protect human health.
Further action is needed to bring down pollution, especially as limits and targets may be tightened in response to growing evidence of health impacts at concentrations below the current values.
32 their shared precursors (
X volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs).
When inhaled, both ozone and particulates have adverse effects on human health.
These include aggravation of respiratory conditions such as asthma (from short-term exposure) and respiratory and cardiovascular illness as well as premature mortality (from longterm exposure) (33).
Their effect is likely to be additive, at least in the short
These health impacts are caused by high concentrations that occur mainly in the urban areas of central, eastern and southern Europe.
For particulates, high levels occur over the whole year, while ozone is mainly a problem during the summer months.
Ozone levels were especially high during the summer heatwave of 2003.
Some people are more vulnerable to high concentrations of ozone and fine particulates than others.
The worst effects are generally seen in children, asthmatics and the elderly, as well as those exercising outdoors.
Despite recent reductions in emissions of both ozone precursors and fine particulates (by 30 % and 36 % respectively from 1990 to 2001), it is estimated that up to 45 % of Europe's urban population remains exposed to particulate concentrations exceeding limit values and up to 30 % to ozone concentrations above target levels for protecting human health.
The emission cuts achieved so far have been mainly due to the introduction of catalysts on new cars and to the implementation of the EU solvents directive, which has led to lower emissions from industrial processes.
There is now growing evidence of adverse health effects from concentrations of fine particulates and ozone at levels below the values currently set to protect health.
Discussions are under way within the framework of the EU Clean Air for Europe process (35) that may lead to present limits being reconsidered and eventually tightened.
Proposals under discussion include se�ing longterm reduction targets for 2020 for both air quality concentrations and pollutant emissions.
Technology measures, demand management options and economic instruments are also being considered.
Urban population exposure to pollution levels above EU limit values
The European air quality information system
Airbase includes data for particulates (PM
10 µm or less), ozone and nitrogen dioxide.
Between 1996 and 2001, 25–45 % of the urban population was exposed to particulateconcentrations in excess of the EU limit value and 20–30 % to ozone concentrations above the EU target value for ozone.
The urban population for which exposure estimates can be made increased from 51 to 103 million people over the same period.
Data reliability has therefore increased substantially, but data between 1996 and 2001 make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on exposure trends for either ozone or particulates.

In 2001 country is not on track to meet its target
Between 1990 and 2001 emissions of groundlevel ozone precursors decreased by 30 % in the EU-15 and by 43 % in the New-10.
Road transport is the dominant source of ozone precursors (39 % of total emissions).
Other key sources are energy use (combustion) and use of solvents in industry and households.
The reduction in emissions is mainly due to the introduction of catalysts on new cars (cu�ing emissions of nitrogen oxides) and the implementation of the EU solvents directive (limiting emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds from industrial processes).
Several countries are not on track to meet their targets, making substantial emission reductions necessary.
Emissions of ozone precursors have increased in Cyprus and Turkey and fallen in Estonia, but as these countries have no targets they are not shown.

The climate is projected to continue changing, globally and in Europe, over the next 100 years.
Evidence is growing of climate change's impacts on human and ecosystem health as well as economic viability.
Substantial reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases will be required to ensure that Europe meets its short-term emission targets.
Adaptation measures to manage the negative impacts of climate change also need to be put into place.
Combating climate change is a key environmental priority for the European Union.
The average temperature in Europe has increased by 0.95 °C over the past 100 years and is projected to rise by as much as a further 6.3 °C by 2100.
This contrasts with the European Union's indicative target of limiting the longterm global temperature increase to 2 °C. Sea levels are also rising (by up to 0.2 m over the past century) and are projected to increase further.
Four of the five years with the largest economic losses have occurred since 1997.
Other impacts include an increase of about ten days in the average growing season in Europe over the past 20 years.
However, projections indicate that this positive development may in some areas be counteracted by an increased risk of water shortage, which would harm vegetation.
These changes in growing season length may require adaptation measures and changes in agriculture and nature protection strategies.
The Kyoto Protocol has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrialised countries to 5 % below 1990 levels by the period 2008–2012.
A recent study confirms previous estimates that to mitigate climate change in the longer term much larger global emission reductions would be needed (37).
Several European Union Member States have set indicative targets for substantially cu�ing their emissions.
For example, the United Kingdom and Germany have reduction targets of 60 % and 30 % (from 1990 levels), to be met by 2050 and 2030 respectively.

Foreword high nature value farmland are currently lacking, however.
In the Kyiv Resolution on Biodiversity, the European environment ministers therefore agreed to identify high nature value farmland and take adequate conservation measures.
Europe’s rich cultural and natural heritage is reflected in its traditional agricultural landscapes.
A wide variety of natural conditions and farming traditions has created unique landscapes that are not only pleasing to the eye but provide the living conditions for many plants and animals.
High nature value farmland comprises the hot spots of biological diversity in rural areas and is o�en characteristic of extensive farming practices.
As a contribution to this process, EEA and UNEP have commissioned a study on agriculture and biodiversity and a study to quantify and delineate high nature value farmland areas.
The outcome is this joint report, in which preliminary data on the distribution and conservation status of high nature value farmland and the current targeting of policy instruments are presented.
Over the last few decades, however, biodiversity on farmland has declined seriously.
Large scale rationalisation and intensification of agricultural production has taken its toll.
Many marginal and extensively farmed areas were either improved or abandoned, thus considerably reducing habitat and species diversity.
Seminatural vegetation has declined rapidly and roughly two thirds of the currently endangered bird species depend on agricultural habitats.
We sincerely hope that this joint report will spur the policy debate and encourage countries and institutions to elaborate and refine the high nature value farmland concept, and further focus their conservation efforts.
This has not gone unnoticed and the conservation of biodiversity on agricultural land is now high on the political agenda.
Of the many relevant conservation efforts at European level, we would like to mention the panEuropean biological and landscape diversity strategy (PEBDLS), the Bern Convention, the European Landscape Convention, and, at EU level, the habitats and birds directives and the biodiversity action plan for agriculture.
Executive Director, European Environment Agency
In the sixth environment action programme, the EU has commi�ed itself to halt biodiversity decline by 2010.
Conserving high nature value farmland is key to achieving this target.
PanEuropean data on distribution and conservation status of
Traditional agricultural systems have shaped the European landscape and created habitats for a wide range of species, many of which are of particular conservation concern.
High nature value farmland comprises hot spots of biodiversity in rural areas and is usually characterised by extensive farming practices.
Its conservation value is acknowledged in several EU policy documents such as the EU Regulation on rural development (EC 1257/1999).
Distribution and conservation status of high nature value farmland, however, has not yet been assessed at the panEuropean level.
and alpine pastures and meadows. Agriculture in these areas is usually extensive and vulnerable to change.
High nature value farmland areas are generally under severe pressure due to a vulnerable economy and depopulation.
Predominant agricultural trends are intensification on the one hand and land abandonment on the other.
Both are considered detrimental to biodiversity.
Li�le information exists on the exact conservation status of high nature value farmland areas, but the overall population trends of characteristic species, such as the great bustard Otis tarda, black grouse Tetrao tetrix and corncrake Crex crex are negative.
Policy responses in the EU include site protection under the habitats and bird directives and environment measures under the common agricultural policy.
The Natura 2000 sites, as proposed by the Member States, cover less than one third of high nature value farmland area.
Their conservation status is again largely unknown.
A monitoring system is under development but not yet operational.
In their Kyiv Resolution on Biodiversity, the European environment ministers agreed to complete the identification of all high nature value farmland areas by 2006 and commi�ed themselves to support their economic and ecological viability.
The target is to cover 'a substantial proportion' of such areas with rural development and agrienvironment measures by 2008. A high nature value farmland indicator is currently under preparation within the framework of IRENA1.
This joint report highlights the preliminary results of this indicator and analyses the current targeting of high nature value farmland by policy measures.
Conservation of high nature value farmland areas relies to a large extent on measures under the so-called 'second pillar' of the common agricultural policy, notably support to less favoured areas and agrienvironment schemes.
According to our preliminary estimates, roughly 15–25 % of the European countryside qualifies as high nature value farmland.
The largest areas are found in eastern and southern Europe.
They consist of habitats such as seminatural grasslands, dehesas, montados and steppe areas.
High nature value farmland is also relatively abundant in mountainous regions.
Examples are grazed uplands in the United Kingdom
Joint project between DG Agriculture, DG JRC, DG Environment, Eurostat and EEA, operationalising the agrienvironment indicators mentioned in COM(2000)20 and COM(2001)144.
Current policy measures appear insufficient to prevent further decline in high nature value farmland areas and thus to reach the 2010 biodiversity target.
The geographical targeting of agriculture subsidies, especially of less favoured area support and agrienvironment schemes, needs to be reconsidered.
It should be kept in mind, though, that the current data do not allow for detailed geographical analysis.
A major effort is needed to fill the data gaps on habitat and species distribution and the targeting and effectiveness of support measures.
What is high nature value farmland and why is it important?
inputs, use of machinery and overall productivity) (see Figure 2).
The most intensive arable and grassland systems are virtually monocultures.
Despite their low intrinsic biodiversity, however, they may still provide wintering grounds for migratory waterfowl.
Europe is famous for its unique rural landscapes that represent a rich cultural and natural heritage.
Regionally differing farming practices have led to a variety of agricultural habitats that host a large number of plant and animal species.
The biodiversity of farmland, however, has rapidly declined across Europe in the last few decades, as illustrated here for common birds of the countryside (Figure 1, see also Donald et al., 2001).
Population trend common birds
Population index (1980 = 100) 110
Highest biodiversity coincides with low agricultural inputs.
Although extensive mixed arable systems may also support high biodiversity, the majority of high nature value farmland consists of seminatural grasslands.
They are the true hot spots for biodiversity.
In the Dutch province of Friesland, for example, only 1.5 % of the land area is unfertilised seminatural grassland, yet 60 % of terrestrial plants are more or less confined to this habitat (Schotsman, cited in Baldock and Benne�, 2002).
(1993, 1995) described the general characteristics of low-input farming systems in terms of biodiversity and management practices and introduced the term high nature value farmland.
Most of these farming systems are characterised by low stocking densities, low use of chemical inputs and o�en labour intensive management practices, such as shepherding.
Source: Birdlife International 2004 (see Appendix B for details).
Typical examples of high nature value farmland are extensively grazed uplands in the United Kingdom, alpine meadows and pasture, steppic areas in eastern and southern Europe and dehesas and montados in Spain and Portugal.
Particularly important for biodiversity are smallscale agricultural farming systems in central and eastern Europe, responsible for creating and maintaining species-rich seminatural grasslands (see Figure 3).
That agriculture-related biodiversity is under relatively high pressure is also evident from the fact that roughly two thirds of the threatened and vulnerable bird species in Europe occur on farmland (Tucker and Heath, 1994). Maintaining adequate farming practices is therefore key to biodiversity conservation.
Biodiversity generally decreases when the intensity of farming increases (in terms of nutrient and pesticide

European Environment Agency. The concept builds on analyses of land cover, farm systems (including scale, products, input use and management) and species distribution.
Figure 4 shows the estimated distribution for the current EU Member States on the basis of land cover data only3.
Although the other aspects modify the picture to a certain extent, it is clear that the prevalence of high nature value farmland is in southern and eastern Europe plus northern United Kingdom.
Preliminary data on the distribution and conservation status of high nature value farmland are obtained on the basis of a European2 indicator developed for the

Trends in high nature value farmland the use of nitrogenous fertilisers (Figure 5).
The extensive character of most high nature value farming systems can be explained by natural conditions which prevent the use of modern techniques and machinery, general socio-economic constraints, or a combination of both.
High nature value farmland is threatened by two contrasting trends: intensification and abandonment.
Fertiliser use in western Europe appears generally to have levelled off.
In central and eastern Europe, current input rates are comparably low, but the new agroeconomic framework a�er accession is expected to lead to some intensification in the new EU Member States from 2004 onwards (EEA, 2004).
Intensification
Environmental pressures are expected to decrease somewhat in western Europe, whilst many areas in central and eastern Europe will experience increasing agricultural intensity.
This means that some of the high nature value farmland will probably be exposed to intensification in the near future.
Where natural and economic conditions allow, farming will intensify in order to increase yields and overall efficiency.
This has been a continuous process in most parts of western Europe for decades, reflected in a steady increase in fertiliser inputs and milk and cereal yields.
In eastern Europe investment in the agricultural sector has dropped substantially due to the political and economical changes during the 1990s.
This is reflected in the sudden drop in
N-fertiliser consumption in selected central and eastern European countries* and the EU kg/ha 80
The socio-economic conditions in rural areas with extensive agriculture are generally unfavourable.
Depopulation is occurring in many rural areas, affecting the countryside and the environment profoundly. Low incomes, hard working conditions and a lack of social services in many areas make farming a less a�ractive option for young people.
The proportion of the elderly is already very high amongst farmers.
As a result, land abandonment is to be expected (Heilig 2002a, b).
0 Land abandonment is already a common phenomenon in regions where agricultural productivity is relatively low (Baldock et al., 1996).
The situation is particularly worrying in central and eastern Europe, where political and economic change has negatively affected the conditions for farming (EEA, 2004).

High nature value farmland: Characteristics, trends and policy challenges shelter against predators (see for example Po�s, 1986).
Tucker and Heath (1994) estimate that more than 40 % of all declining bird species in Europe are affected by agricultural intensification, whereas more than 20 % are affected by abandonment.
Similar data sets for other countries are rare, since land abandonment is not easily detected in general agricultural statistics.
Therefore no picture can be drawn up for Europe as a whole, but on the basis of their generally lower viability (see Hellegers and Godeschalk, 1998) it is to be expected that extensive farming systems are most vulnerable to abandonment.

Impacts on nature value
The black grouse Tetrao tetrix occurs on grazed heaths and moorland, and is showing a rapid and almost Europewide decline (Tucker and Heath, 1994).
Upland habitats in the United Kingdom suffer from overgrazing and afforestation, causing moderate population decline.
In lowland western Europe, this once rather common species is now practically extinct because of habitat destruction and agricultural intensification.
In the Netherlands, for example, black grouse numbers fell from several thousands in the 1950s to less than 100 today (see Niewold, 1990).
Loss of extensive grassland habitat is reflected by the large-scale decline of the corncrake Crex crex.
Its numbers have fallen by more than 50 % in 10 countries.
Drainage of wet grasslands, intensification and the conversion of hay meadows into silage grasslands are the main causes (Tucker and Heath, 1994).
The corncrake is most common in central and eastern Europe, but habitat loss and population decline also occurs
Loss of seminatural vegetations is a consequence of the above agricultural trends. Although many case studies exist (see for example Veen and Seffer, 1999), no reliable panEuropean trend data are currently available for plant communities and habitats.
The best data available are for birds.
Farmland birds are indicative of overall biodiversity, since they depend on a variety of plant and animal food and diverse vegetation structures for feeding, nesting and
The relatively small number of priority species in northern Europe does not necessarily reflect low nature value or absence of conservation problems, since species richness generally decreases with latitude.
9 there (Veen et al., 2000; Tucker and Heath, 1994).
The great bustard Otis tarda is characteristic of steppe habitats in southern and eastern Europe.
In Hungary, the great bustard population dropped from 2 500 individuals in 1985 to 1 100 individuals in 1990 (Fésüs et al., 1992).
Reasons for this are intensified agricultural use of meadows and pastures, as well as increasing cultivation of maize and sunflowers.
In the 1990s the Hungarian great bustard population was stable (Faragó, 2003).

Policy responses
Agriculture in Europe is affected by a wide range of policies at both regional and national levels, including strategic initiatives such as the PanEuropean biological and landscape diversity strategy and the EU biodiversity action plan for agriculture, environmental legislation such as the EU nitrates, birds and habitats directives, and sectoral support under the EU.
They are either aimed at obligatory site protection or based on voluntary measures in the wider countryside.
and habitats directives (79/409/EEC, 92/43/EEC).
Annex I of the habitats directive lists natural and seminatural habitat types that must be maintained in a favourable conservation status by the Member States.
The Natura 2000 network will build on the proposed sites of communal interest (pSCIs 5) that have been listed by the Member States.
Out of the 198 habitat types listed in Annex I of the habitats directive, 28 require extensive agricultural management and can be regarded as high nature value farmland.
Site protection
The main policy instruments for site protection at EU level are the birds
Figure 8 gives an overview of the share of these agricultural habitat types within the Natura 2000 network.
The pa�ern is rather consistent with the distribution

5 The pSCIs have to be further designated as Special Area of Conservation (SAC).
High nature value farmland: Characteristics, trends and policy challenges of high nature value farmland (compare with Figure 4).
The average share of extensive agricultural habitats within pSCIs is 15 %, even exceeding 50 % in parts of Spain and the United Kingdom (see Figure 8).
This underlines their conservation value.
The second pillar of the CAP allows Member States to implement measures for alleviating or improving the ecological impacts of agriculture.
There is an array of measures that can be used to support environmentally friendly farming systems.
However, the main elements relevant to high nature value farmland conservation are agrienvironment schemes and less favoured area payments6.
The following sections will analyse the geographical targeting of these policy measures.
Agrienvironment schemes
Nonetheless, less than one third of the high nature value farmland areas is covered by pSCIs (see Appendix B).
Currently, there are no good monitoring data available about trends within the Natura 2000 sites.
All in all, it can be concluded that the site protection measures will at best conserve a minority of high nature value farmland.
Under the current rural development regulation, adopted in 20037, Member States are obliged to put agrienvironment schemes in place.
Support can be granted to farmers for environmentally favourable measures, including conservation of high nature value farmed environments which are under threat.
At an EU level the common agricultural policy (CAP) is the most relevant policy framework with regard to conservation of high nature value farmland, in particular outside protected areas.
The CAP is composed of two 'pillars'.
The regulation is flexible, allowing Member States to design tailor-made schemes for regional environmental issues.
As a consequence, agrienvironmental schemes are highly variable and generally not targeted at distinct geographical areas on the basis of commonly agreed criteria.
Figure 9 shows the coverage of agrienvironment schemes in the EU Member States.
The level of implementation of agrienvironment schemes in the different countries varies considerably.
In Finland, Sweden, Luxemburg, Austria and Germany, relatively large proportions of the utilised agricultural area are under agrienvironment schemes, in contrast with Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Greece.
The first pillar is a commodity-based regime.
Originally it was a market intervention mechanism, providing price guarantees, production incentives and export subsidies for certain crops and livestock products.
As such it was a catalyst of agricultural productivity.
Through successive reforms, the first pillar subsidies have become more and more decoupled from production.
Subsidies are now provided through direct payments on the basis of historic production levels.
Since the 2003 CAP reform, first pillar payments are subject to environmental conditions.
The reformed first pillar regime is less damaging to the environment, especially when providing incentives for farming in marginal areas (Hellegers and Godeschalk, 1998).
In general, there is no clear relationship between the overall agrienvironment expenditure per hectare and the share of high nature value farmland (Figure 10, see Appendix B for

High nature value farmland: Characteristics, trends and policy challenges value farmland, provided that they do not create incentives for intensification and particularly overgrazing.
The receipt of less favoured area support requires compliance with good farming practice as defined by Member States.
In addition, there are ceilings on stocking densities in many regions, but these are o�en set at a level that is too high from a conservation point of view.
For example, in France ceilings of 1.8 livestock units per hectare apply in mountainous less favoured areas (Baldock and Benne�, 2002).
details). Countries with large areas of high nature value farmland, such as Spain, have small budgets per hectare for agrienvironment schemes.
Although no precise data are available on geographical spending pa�erns within countries, the targeting of agrienvironment measures at a European level seems far from optimal from a biodiversity conservation perspective.
Furthermore, recent research shows that current agrienvironment schemes aimed at biodiversity are not necessarily effective and that their monitoring is mostly insufficient (Klein and Sutherland, 2003).
Less favoured areas
Member States have considerable discretion both in the level of expenditure they commit and in the precise design of the less favoured area support payments.
Figure 11 shows the distribution of designated less favoured areas.
They cover more than half the utilised agricultural area in the EU, including all the higher and more mountainous ground.
Some high nature value farmland is within the more productive areas outside less favoured areas, such as saltmarshes, wet grasslands and hay meadows.
However, the great majority falls within the less favoured areas (compare with Figure 4).
Farmers in less favoured areas are eligible for payments per hectare in addition to conventional CAP support.
These compensatory payments have a combination of social and environmental objectives and are part of the second pillar of the CAP.
They will generally increase profitability of farming in marginal areas under natural constraints.
As such they are potentially an effective tool for preventing abandonment of high nature

• High nature value farmland has been widely recognised as a valuable asset of the European countryside, providing habitat for a wide range of species.
Maintaining a good conservation status is key to reaching the 2010 target of halting the loss of biodiversity.
• Outside protected areas, conservation of high nature value farmland depends mainly on the application of instruments within the common agricultural policy, notably less favoured area support and agrienvironment schemes.
These instruments, however, do not appear to be well targeted at high nature value farmland areas.
Southern European high nature value farmland areas in particular get relatively li�le support.
• High nature value farmland makes up about 15–25 % of the utilised agricultural area in Europe.
It is unevenly distributed, with concentrations in peripheral parts of Europe.
• Overall, the 2010 biodiversity target is unlikely to be reached without additional policy efforts with regard to the conservation of high nature value farmland.
• The conservation status of high nature value farmland is insufficiently known, but case studies indicate serious biodiversity decline.
The main threats are intensification and abandonment.
• Site protection under the birds and habitats directives is an appropriate but insufficient conservation tool.
At best about one third of the high nature value farmland area will benefit from this measure.

General concept
Land cover approach
The high nature value farmland indicator cf. Andersen (2003) distinguishes the following types of high nature value farmland:
For the land cover analysis, a regionally differentiated selection was made of agricultural habitats where high nature value farmland may be expected (see Table A1 for all farmland habitats considered, for details see Andersen, 2003).
Both maximum and minimum estimates were made.
In the maximum estimate all land cover classes with potential high nature value farmland were included.
In the minimum estimate only those land cover classes were included that have the highest probability of containing high nature value farmland.
The map in Figure 4 is based on the minimum estimate.
Farm system approach
The farm system classification builds on production, input and management characteristics and distinguishes the following main types:
• high nature value cropping systems: low intensity arable systems.
Might have livestock, but this is not the dominant income source;
Type 1 and Type 2 areas are identified on the basis of land cover data (Corine database) and agronomic and economic farm-level data (FADN).
Combined, these two approaches give information on distribution and farming characteristics.
Due to data limitations this was possible for breeding birds only (see Andersen, 2003, for details on species selection and aggregation method).
It is not possible at this stage to merge fully the different results into one map, or to produce separate maps for the different high nature value farmland types.
• high nature value off-farm grazing systems: systems with ca�le, sheep or goats grazing outside the farm, for example on common land;
• high nature value permanent grassland systems: ca�le, sheep or goat systems where the main forage resource is grass from permanent or rough grassland;
Each of these approaches has its strengths and weaknesses.
The species approach suffers from data gaps and should be regarded as an additional information source rather than a tool for delineating high nature value farmland.
The land cover data give the best impression of the spatial distribution of high nature value farmland, whereas the farm data are considered a more reliable indicator for the total share of high nature value farmland.

concern were identified according to their global and European status, and the proportion of their total of their world population occurring in Europe (Tucker, 1997, see Table A3).
The SPEC designation has become accepted as highlighting bird species of especially high conservation concern.
Analogous to the land cover approach, the farm system classification was differentiated in a minimum and maximum variant.
For the calculations in this joint report only the minimum figures were used (see also Table A2 and Figure A1).
Species approach
A total of 102 species were chosen for inclusion in the analyses.
This list included all category 1–3 species which were considered to be potentially associated with farmland throughout Europe (see Andersen, 2003, and Tucker, 1997 for details).
A cumulative distribution map was then drawn up on the basis of the EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds (Hagemeijer and Blair, 1997).

This is a conceptual graph, not directly derived from empirical data.
Hence the axes do not mention concrete variables.
However, empirical data that support this general relationship between agricultural intensity and biodiversity do exist.
(1995) presented a rather similar graph of the relationship between plant diversity and productivity, based on vegetation research by Peeters et al. (1993).
Furthermore, the relationship depicted in Figure 2 suggests a low cost effectiveness of agrienvironment measures in intensive farming systems (large input cuts will result in li�le increase in biodiversity).
(2001), who reported low effectiveness of agrienvironment measures in relatively intensive Dutch agricultural landscapes, and the theoretical graph of biodiversity against agricultural intensity as presented in Kleijn and Sutherland (2003).
A second implication of the graph in Figure 2 is that biodiversity may gain from abandonment in intensive systems.
This is consistent with the success of nature development in the Netherlands on former intensive agricultural land (LNV, 2000; RIVM, 2001).
Of course, the depicted relationship is simplified and scale dependent.
Instead of generally reducing inputs for increasing plant diversity, one might take smallscale measures in intensive farming systems, such as leaving cereal headlands unsprayed.
This can be effective for increasing the abundance of wildlife, such as weeds, insects and gamebirds (Boatman and Wilson, 1988).
The more critical species, however, will not benefit.
At the other end of the land use intensity scale, land abandonment may lead to lower species diversity at field level, but natural habitats and ecosystems may add to overall biodiversity in the wider landscape (Baldock et al., 1995).
This is why conservation strategies should ideally be geographically differentiated and geared to local circumstances.
Spatial optimisation (through creation of smallscale landscape elements or large-scale nature developemt) is generally the most valid in intensive systems, whereas maintenace of low-input farming is more appropriate in extensive systems. See Hoogeveen et al.
Figure 4The map in Figure 4 is based on the minimum Corine estimate (see Appendix A for details).
There is a need for future revisions on the basis of updated and more detailed data, and for refinements on the basis of national datasets.
Due to the limitations of the Corine land cover data, Type 2 high nature value farmland tends to be underrepresented in the minimum estimate (for example bocage landscapes in France).
Type 3 farmland is also only partially included.
Intensively used grassland may be important as wintering grounds for waterfowl but these areas, mainly concentrated in lowland western Europe, do not show up on the map in Figure 4.
Land cover data do not indicate local pressures such as overgrazing.
The indicated distribution of high nature value farmland in the uplands of the UK, for example, may be optimistic because overgrazing is reported from a number of locations.
For Finland and Sweden, the distribution pa�ern of potential high nature value farmland is also optimistic due to interpretation

The estimates of UAA are according to Eurostat 2000 figures.
For Finland and Sweden only the FADN-based estimate of high nature value farmland coverage was used in the calculations because of unacceptable bias in the land cover data.
The official UAA figure for Greece is a gross underestimate of total farmland, since the commons are not included in the statistics.
Expenditure figures per hectare could therefore not be used here, and for this reason Greece was excluded from the calculations.

The 'Environment for Europe' process now brings together 56 countries across three continents to jointly address environmental challenges.
In support of this process, the European Environment Agency has prepared a series of assessments of the environment for the pan-European region to provide policy-relevant, up-to-date and reliable information on the interactions between the environment and society.
The irst comprehensive assessment of the state of the pan-European environment was presented in Soia in 1995.
Updated assessments were presented at the Ministerial Conferences in Aarhus in 1998 and Kiev in 2003.
This is the fourth report in the series.
Where possible the report evaluates progress, primarily against the objectives of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community and the Environment Strategy for Countries of Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia.
The report has been prepared in close partnership with a range of international organisations, governmental institutions and non-governmental organisations across the region.
Despite noteworthy progress in promoting environmental policy and sustainable development across the pan-European region, an 'implementation gap' in the use of integrated policy approaches remains.

Successful implementation depends on the setting of clear and realistic targets together with mechanisms to monitor progress.
Environmental information across the region still varies in quality, with the availability and reliability of data differing considerably.
There is substantial room for further improvement in making much-needed data and information not only accessible, but also more comparable and reliable.
The pan-European region harbours rich cultural and environmental diversity.
More than 870 million people live in the region; more than half of them in Western and Central Europe (WCE), making the European Union (EU) one of the most densely populated areas of the world with more than 100 people per square kilometre.
This is in stark contrast to the relatively sparse populations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where the average density is well below 20 people per square kilometre.
Economic recovery in recent years has resulted in an increase, in relative terms, of national income in virtually all countries of the pan-European region.
Economic growth rates have been particularly high in South Eastern Europe (SEE) and EECCA countries.

Increasingly, the economies of EECCA countries are moving away from reliance on agricultural output towards service industries.
Nonetheless, the EECCA region is still relatively more dependent on mineral extraction and agriculture, often resulting in major environmental pressures and high volumes of wastes.
The number of independent states in the region has increased from 33 in 1990 to 53 in 2007, during which time the EU expanded from 15 to 27 Member States.
Environment and health: Air quality
Air pollution, mainly by ine particles and ground‑level ozone, continues to pose a signiicant threat to health: it shortens average life expectancy in WCE by almost one year and affects the healthy development of children.
Most air pollutants have increased in EECCA by more than 10 % as a result of economic recovery, increases in transport, and the lack of effectiveness of air pollution protection policies.
In EECCA the poor quality of the data precludes an in-depth assessment of air quality and its consequences.
However, the limited data available indicates that the main health threat in EECCA and SEE is, as in WCE, from small particles and their toxic constituents.

More than 100 million people in the pan‑European region still do not have access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.
In EECCA and SEE the quality of the water supply and sanitation services has deteriorated continuously over the past 15 years, with the rural population being mostaffected.
One-third of the pan-European population lives in countries where water resources are under substantial pressure.
High leakage losses in water distribution systems, poor management and maintenance of irrigation systems, and unsustainable cropping patterns exacerbate the impacts of droughts and water scarcity.

Since the Kiev Conference, progress has been made both in policy development and in the availability of information.
However, it is still too early to record any marked improvement in the status of soil resources.
Given the complexity of current risks, especially climate change, new thinking on mechanisms to improve the evidence base to support action on soils is needed.
The exchange of best practices between countries and regions with similar soil conditions could reduce remediation costs across many soil threats, and provide an important basis for cooperation.

Environment and health: Hazardous chemicals
The chemical industry has been growing worldwide.
In the European Union the production of toxic chemicals has increased at almost the same rate as total chemical production, and both have grown faster than GDP.
Globalisation is resulting in a shift of environmental burdens to developing countries and the re-import of hazards via transboundary pollution and contaminated products.
Recently, signiicant new policies and legislation addressing the management of chemicals have been agreed upon, both in Europe and globally. For the EU, this includes the legislation on Registrati on,
Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH), which entered into force in 2007.
At the international level, the Strategic Approach to International Chemical Management (SAICM) was adopted in 2006.
Additionally, the Global Harmonised System on classiication and labelling (GHS) was agreed and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent (PIC) entered into force.
Emissions of greenhouse gases have increased in recent years in most European countries and are projected to continue to do so in the future.
Many European countries have adopted national programmes to reduce emissions, but some of them will still have dificulties in reaching their Kyoto targets.
The Kyoto Protocol, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and its irst commitment period represent only a irst step in addressing climate change.
Global emissions will have to be reduced by up to 50 % by 2050 to limit temperature increases to a maximum of 2 °C above pre‑industrial levels, the target proposed by the EU as necessary to avoid unacceptable climate change impacts in the future.

Some unavoidable climate change impacts are projected to affect most sectors of the economy and natural resources — even with strong mitigation programmes.
It is therefore also urgent to adapt to those impacts in developing and implementing policies and measures in all sectors of society.
Biodiversity decline and loss of ecosystem services continue to be a major concern across the pan-European region.
In addition, the number of invasive alien species in the region continues to increase.
The Kiev Resolution's overarching target of haltingbiodiversity loss in the region by 2010 will not beachieved without considerable additional efforts and resources.
Communication, education and public awareness programmes, however, are being implemented according to the Kiev Resolution.
There has been signiicant progress in creating ecological networks: the Pan-European Ecological Network and Natura 2000 Network are taking shape, but there is still insuficient information o n their conservation status.

Environmental concerns are becoming increasingly integrated into the forestry and agricultural sectors.
Nonetheless, agriculture still exerts considerable pressure on biodiversity.
The speciic policy targetof identifying all 'high nature value' farmland by 2006 has not been reached.
Marine and coastal environment
Eutrophication remains a problem in all enclosed seas and sheltered marine waters across the pan-European region.
Reducing diffuse nutrient sources, particularly from agriculture, remains a major challenge and requires increased action.
Overishing is still widespread in all pan‑European seas.
Improved policies and stricter law enforcement are needed for ish stock recovery — especially to stop illegal ishing, but also to reduce the impacts of isheries on the whole marine ecosystem.

Climate change is likely to affect seas and coasts, including marine organisms.
Adaptation policies should include measures to reduce other, non-climatic pressures in order to increase the resilience of marine ecosystems and the coastal zone to climate change.
Actions under regional sea conventions and EU policies have improved water quality in the western seas, for example with regard to some hazardous substances.
Policies geared towards improving the generally poor state of Europe's marine and coastal environment should be based on an ecosystem approach.
Sustainable consumption and production
The concept of sustainable consumption and production has become more prominent on the policy agenda since the Kiev Conference.
However, few concrete outcomes have emerged, and implementation strategies and tools to measure environmental impacts need to be put in place.
Per capita resource use levels have remained stable in all regions over recent years, and some decoupling has been achieved between resource use and economic growth.
Resource use eficiency varies signiicantly between countries, and is several times higher in the EU‑15 than in the EU‑10 and SEE countries, and up to twenty times higher than in EECCA.
Patterns of consumption are changing rapidly, driven by socio-economic changes.
The consumption categories causing the highest life-cycle environmental impacts are food and beverages, private transport, and housing.
In the EU, tourism and air travel are emerging as key areas of future impacts.
The pan-European region is generating ever more waste.
Landill, environmentally the least preferred option, is still the most common method of waste management across the pan‑European region.
EU Member States have made some progress in limiting the share of municipal waste going to landill.
Many EECCA and SEE countries have developed waste strategies and legislation for waste, but these still need to be implemented effectively.
Source: Figure 6.20 of The fourth assessment.
Proper waste collection and safe landilling remain a challenge.
In some EECCA countries an even bigger challenge is ensuring the environmental safety and clean-up of hazardous waste sites inherited from the past.
Modern, intensive agriculture often has a negative impact through its use and pollution of air, water and soil.
On the other hand, farming still plays a positive role in preserving Europe's landscapes and biodiversity.
The area of irrigated land in the southern EU‑15 and SEE has increased, showing a continuing trend of agricultural intensiication.
Irrigation has ofte n caused declines in water resources and quality, salinisation and land degradation — especially in southern and eastern EECCA.
Most of SEE and EECCA will require continued international support to achieve better environmental management of the agricultural sector.

International tourist arrivals in the pan-European region continue to grow.
Tourism is one of the main drivers of increased demand for the most environmentally damaging transport modes: private cars and, more critically, air transport.
Coasts, islands and mountains remain particularly sensitive to tourism development.
Degradation, sometimes irreversible, has already occurred in some popular mass-tourism destinations.
The impacts of tourism are projected to grow as a result of increasing afluence and lifestyle and demographic changes.
Tourist behaviour remains a crucial factor for the sustainability of the sector.

Sectors: Transport
Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from transport in SEE and WCE are growing rapidly along with the general growth in transport.
CO emissions per capita in WCE continue to be two
2 to four times higher than in SEE and EECCA.
Developing competitive urban transport solutions is away of ighting trafic congestion and air quality problems as well as improving transport safety.
For public transport to become competitive, cities need to be planned and developed with public transport in mind.

Energy consumption and resulting greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing in the pan‑European region since the Kiev Conference, despite energy eficiency improvements and an increased use of renewable energy in some areas.
This trend is expected to continue if no additional policies and measures are implemented.
Energy markets in the three pan-European sub‑regions are closely linked.
A signiicant share of natural gas and oil imports into WCE and SEE come from EECCA and this share is projected to rise substantially to 2030.

EEA in brief environment and resources.
The EEA is an important source and custodian of environmentrelated data and indicators and a key provider of environmental knowledge and information services.
The European Environment Agency (EEA) is a European public body dedicated to providing objective, reliable and comparable information on the environment.
The aim of the EEA is to ensure that decision-makers and the general public are kept informed about the state and outlook of the environment.
The EEA also provides the necessary independent scientific knowledge and technical support to enable the Community and member countries take appropriate measures to protect and improve the environment as laid down by the Treaty and by successive Community action programmes on the environment and sustainable development.
The EEA works in partnership with government departments and agencies, international conventions and UN bodies, the scientific community, private sector and civil society.
The European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European environment information and observation network (Eionet) were established by EEC Regulation 1210/90 on 7 May 1990 (as amended by EC Regulation 933/1999 of 29 April 1999 and EC Regulation 1641/2003 of the European Parliament and Council of 22 July 2003).
The decision to locate the Agency in Copenhagen was taken in 1993 and the EEA became operational in 1994.
The founding regulation sets out a number of tasks (Article 2) and priority areas (Article 3) for the EEA; these are addressed through its multi-annual and annual work programmes.
The EEA undertakes a comprehensive range of integrated environmental and thematic assessments.
These include a five-yearly state and outlook of the environment report, thematic and sectoral assessments, analyses of the effectiveness of policy measures, forward studies and the impacts of globalisation on Europe's
The EEA strategy 2009–2013 is the fourth Multi-annual Work Programme of the Agency; it was adopted by the EEA Management Board through written procedure following its 52nd meeting on 26 November 2008.
EEA Strategy 2009–2013 — Multi-annual Work Programme
Our vision
To become recognised as the world's leading body for the provision of timely, relevant and accessible European enviromental data, information, knowledge and assessments.
Chairman of the EEA Management Board
Integrated environmental assessments and anticipating new thinking, especially about ecosystem services, eco-efficiency and emerging technologies and innovations will play a key role in shaping European environmental policies.
Well designed environmental policies are necessary and positive for our society and economy.
The EEA will continue to work closely with neighbouring countries, in particular the West Balkan region.
Importantly, our early and close cooperation not only improves the quality and coverage of environmental information, but also has a part to play in stabilising the environment in these countries.
It also illustrated that for successful implementation of environmental policies we need to engage at a global and regional level with all actors.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank the outgoing Chairman, Lars-Erik Liljelund, for his dedicated and effective leadership of the Management Board.
Over the last few years environment policy questions have again moved up the political agenda, which is lasting proof of the EEA's work, and that its contribution is now more relevant than ever.
The EEA is well placed to further develop its role as a provider of independent and assured environmental information.
In addition, and looking to the next five years, I would like to highlight some of the EEA's strategic issues.
The public, policy-makers, the scientific community and politicians are all benefactors of work carried out by the Agency, and this trend is set to increase; climate change, biodiversity loss, water and air quality are all issues that invoke heated debate.
I appreciate that this will only continue if at its heart is a forward-looking EEA, which over the next 5 years is providing innovative information which is timely, relevant and robust.
This new Strategy will continue to support the aims of the Environment Action Programmes of the EU.
Thus climate change, nature and biodiversity, environment and health as well as natural resources and waste will continue to be at the at the centre of the work of the EEA.
The new Strategy will also take forward the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS).
Chairman of the EEA Scientific Committee
The 5-year State of Environment reports and the pan-European assessments produced by the Agency have helped shape the priorities of the research framework programmes.
In this respect I see a role for the Scientific Committee in becoming more active in helping to shape the research agenda for those fields it covers as well as the research agenda around emerging technological issues such as bio- and nanotechnologies.
The context in which the EEA works is fast evolving.
It is therefore important to grasp the opportunities afforded by new developments, such as GMES and other large scale observation initiatives.
These are likely to modify profoundly the way in which data, information and indicators are provided.
Since its establishment the work of the European Environment Agency has been supported by an independent Scientific Committee, comprising outstanding environmental scientists who collectively cover a broad range of environmental fields and ensure the scientific underpinning of the Agency's products.
The Agency covers a wide environmental agenda and keeps a close eye on emerging trends.
It also has a key role to play in ensuring the appropriate connection between discussions taking place in scientific and political arenas.
It is of particular importance in the period 2009–2013 that the Agency, with the help of its Scientific Committee members, continues to investigate emerging issues for future research planning and identifies scientific gaps and foresight on environmental research both at a European and national level, which could be having implication for the future of the diverse environmental challenges Europe is facing today.
The newly elected Chairman of the EEA Scientific Committee is Dr Detlef Sprinz.
The Scientific Committee welcomes the new EEA Multi-annual Work Programme for the period 2009–2013 as a comprehensive and well-balanced document.
It covers not only natural, physical, biological, chemical and mechanical realms, but also takes into consideration the importance of policy implications, economic drivers and sociological constraints.
This interdisciplinary approach is placed at the heart of the programme through a number of cross-cutting themes and integrated environmental assessments the Agency will undertake.
The EEA Executive Director affected by exposure to high levels of ozone and particulate matter is growing as urban areas expand.
Access to near-real-time ozone data is now possible via the EEA's Ozone web, and is being introduced to doctors and hospitals to provide an alerting system for vulnerable individuals.
At the EEA, we will provide online air-quality data, using ground monitoring stations and earth observations from the GMES programme, so that partners in the health field can understand more about the prevalent environmentrelated respiratory diseases.
New ways of identifying emerging environmental problems
This EEA Strategy outlines our plans for the next five years.
It is shaped around today's and tomorrow's information needs with an overall emphasis on a much wider use of the environmental information that is being collected.
We are streamlining our activities, creating new ways of working, and developing new methods to bring environmental thinking into the mainstream of economic and social policy-making.
New ways of interpreting environmental information
Anticipating the types of information that policy-makers, industry and citizens will need to make decisions in the future is extremely important.
Through our newly formatted publication Signals, we will bring to the attention of our readers those issues that we consider likely to weigh heavily on the agenda for the coming year.
Typical examples where the EEA worked in advance of public demand are agrofuels, energy subsidies, the valuation of ecosystem services and electro-magnetic radiation.
Our work is based on the precautionary principle, evaluation of the burden of evidence, decision-making under varying degrees of uncertainty and the use of decision-support models and scenarios.
Over the next five years we will create a simple calculus to allow us to anticipate the potential environmental impacts arising from today's and tomorrow's social and economic drivers.
New ways of working
At the EEA, we will be building the equivalent of official statistics for ecological services and environmental assets; to set alongside the traditional assets of our economy.
In the future we will be able to demonstrate how companies and governments can embed ecosystem services to restructure the global economy.
New ways of using environmental information
People need up-to-date information on their environment. For example, the number of people
As more and more people become convinced about the importance of the environment in their lives, the demand for reliable local information has grown explosively.
Providing information through the EEA's networks has been a unique and positive experience.
Using up-to-date technologies and software, we have been able to capitalise on the scientific advances in monitoring and observation.
Today, there is the realisation that citizen observers, especially those who live in remote regions, or are close to the environment through their lives or professions have much to tell. Working in regions such as the Arctic, it is often the indigenous peoples who detect changes
more quickly than any well-designed sampling programme.
Combining these sources of evidence within the formal world of assessment and analysis will become very important.
The EEA has been extending and building its networks and sources for observing and knowledge-gathering through its global citizen environment observatory.
Over the next five years, we will be extending the number of applications, through the Shared Environmental Information System to provide a broad range of global to local environmental monitoring services.
Our goal
We aim to achieve this over the next five years by:
• continuing to support implementation of Europe's environmental legislation through analyses and assessments of Europe's environment;
• ensuring continuous access to high quality environmental data, information and services;
Today, the majority of Europeans agree that the environment has a significant impact on their quality of life and that global trends play a significant part in this.
They want to see that the environment, as well as economic and social needs, are taken into account in decisions about transport, energy, housing, agriculture, fish, food and health.
Businesses are also seeking greater innovation and eco-efficiency to achieve higher environmental standards and maintain their competitiveness in the economy.
• producing integrated environmental assessments and forward studies for Europe increasingly in the global context;
• addressing critical environmental priorities as they arise on the policy agenda;
• improving communications and dissemination to decision-makers and citizens via multi-media, user-friendly, multilingual information.
Over the past 30 years, Europeans have seen emissions of air pollutants significantly reduced, production of ozone-layer damaging chemicals cut by 95 %, creation of a treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an innovative scheme for carbon trading and offset markets, protection of animals and plants, improvements in the quality of fresh water and coastal seas and universal access to safe drinking water.
Many of these improvements have been delivered through implementation of the environmental acquis communautaire.
At the same time, citizens remain concerned about climate change, the quality of air they breathe, how to deal with waste and the impacts of chemicals.
They have many questions about what is happening to the environment and how it will affect them and future generations.
Our goal at the EEA is to provide European decision-makers and citizens with access to timely and relevant information and knowledge to provide a sound basis for environmental policies, to help answer their questions about the environment in their daily lives and to ensure that environmental thinking and education is brought into the mainstream of decision-making.
Our strategy for 2009–2013
Our new strategy is built on three main activities:
• continuing to support the information needs set down in EU and international environmental legislation and especially its 6th Environment Action Programme;
• providing more timely assessments on how and why the environment is changing and whether environmental policies, including the 6th Environment Action Programme, the EU Sustainable Development Strategy and those in related areas have been effective;
The last few years have seen a growing awareness of environmental change and the need for urgent policy action.
This in turn has led to an explosive growth of environmental initiatives and institutions.
Our strategy aims to respond to these changes by focusing on consolidating and improving the timing, spatial resolution and quality of environmental data flows, establishing new data sources where needed and encouraging a greater integration of knowledge about the linkages between ecosystems and the major socio-economic arenas and improving the quality and effectiveness of environmental education in Europe.
• improving the coordination and dissemination of environmental data and knowledge across Europe.
This strategy document describes the EEA's activities under four areas:
The EEA 2009–2013 Strategy is the fourth Multi-annual Work Programme.
It builds upon the successful delivery of our previous strategy for 2004–2008, which was based on the key priorities of the 6th Environment Action Programme and established the Agency as a key provider in Europe of environmental data, information and knowledge.
• Environmental themes
• Cross-cutting themes
• Integrated environmental assessment
• Information services and communications.
The 2008 effectiveness evaluation of the EEA stated that 'The Agency is ... the most efficient way to deliver the products and services required by the stakeholders. ...
It is difficult to see ... how the provision of impartial and reliable information, could be performed through any of the possible other mechanisms available for European organisations'.
The 2008 evaluation also gave a number of recommendations on priority setting and dissemination.
These have been acted on in defining the future priorities and shape of Agency's resources.
Objectives
Our core objective 2009–2013
Our strategic objectives are to:
• play a key role in the development and implementation of European environment policies and related areas, especially the European Commission's Environment Action Programme;
The core objective of the EEA will be to produce European, pan-European and regional integrated environmental data and indicator sets, assessments and thematic analyses in order to provide a sound decision basis for environmental policies in the EU and Member countries and for cooperation with candidate and potential candidate countries and those covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy.
• monitor the effectiveness of environmental policies of EU and member countries of the EEA and in candidate and potential candidate countries;
• support the monitoring of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (through assistance for the Sustainable Development Indicators) focusing on core environmentrelated issues;
We will continue to work intensively with Eionet, cooperating countries and a wide range of partner institutions, including European Commission, government departments and agencies, international conventions and UN bodies, the scientific, technical and research communities, private sector and civil society, in order to quality assure relevance and quality of the data, analyses and information that we provide.
• provide access to more regularly updated information and where possible near real-time data to improve timeliness of environmental information through the Shared Environmental Information System and the Environmental Data Centres;
• anticipate new ideas and thinking, especially about ecosystem services, resource use and emerging technologies and innovations and behavioural changes;
• develop new web-based services for environmental educational needs;
• help ensure, through effective communications and information services, that environmental thinking is brought into the mainstream of decision-making and the daily lives of European citizens.

Our networks and governance
Eionet is widely acknowledged for its support of multiple forms of cooperation and a positive example of institutional and technical partnership.
Eionet is particularly effective in its promotion of good governance in European and international environmental monitoring and reporting activities, such as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems and UN Environment Watch.
The EEA is governed by a Management Board made up of its member countries, and representatives from the European Parliament and the European Commission.
The Bureau is made up of the Chair and Vice Chairs of the Management Board.
Each member country has a management board member supported by a national focal point and a number of national reference centres and principal contact points.
The EEA has a Scientific Committee, made up of independent experts from the field of environment, including social scientists and sectoral specialists.
The Committee offers advice to EEA staff and gives opinions on different issues.
Other networks that the EEA interacts with include the Heads of European Agencies, of Environmental Protection Agencies, and of Environmental Conservation Agencies, the Scientific Committee Chairs of EU Agencies and Community Bodies, networks established under the EU Neighbourhood Programme, the EU Mediterranean Action Plan, and within the Nordic and Arctic Councils, international networks including those established under the UN and multilateral environmental conventions and a variety of international and European research networks.
Eionet — the European environment information and observing network, covering 39 member and cooperating countries — is the unique partnership between the EEA and its member countries and is central to the EEA's networking activities.
In all there are nearly 400 people involved in Eionet.
We will undertake this area of work through the strategic area:
• EEA governance and partnerships.
The 2008 effectiveness evaluation of the Agency confirmed that 'The establishment of this network system.. is seen as one of the major achievements of the EEA, and a key factor in enabling it to meet its objectives'.
National focal points
Making it happen
The EEA draws its staff from across the 32 member countries.
It also has a number of national experts.
We aim to maximise the agency's resources for our environmental work by:
• achieving our EMAS environmental goals every year;
• reorganising to make the Agency more responsive and flexible;
The working capacity of the EEA is enhanced by its five European Topic Centres on Air and Climate Change, Biological Diversity, Land Use and Spatial Information, Water and Sustainable Consumption and Production.
The topic centres are distributed across the EEA member countries.
• avoiding duplication with other EU institutions;
• liaising with staff across the European Commission on our thematic work and to ensure administrative consistency;
• making best use of all European funded environmental actions;
• continuing to improve the way we communicate and provide information to our key stakeholders and citizens;
The agency's daily work is primarily with the members of the Group of Four — made up of the EEA, and the Directorate Generals of Environment, Joint Research Centre and Eurostat.
The aim of the group is to maximise the use of resources by streamlining environmental reporting and providing common web-hosting for ten thematic areas.
The Environmental Data Centres include climate change, water, air, biodiversity, and land use (managed by EEA), forests and soils (managed by JRC) and waste, natural resources and products (managed by Eurostat).
• continuing to maximise staff availability and efficiency by focusing on health and wellbeing.
Our Making it happen activities will be carried through the strategic area:
• EEA internal management and administration.
Over the next five years we will continue to implement a new Quality Management System and Business Continuity Planning, continue to adopt any remaining provision under the Staff Regulation and make revisions to our existing indicator management system, data reporting, internal management system and balanced scorecard to make clear the link between work undertaken resources used and results achieved.
The 2008 effectiveness evaluation stated that 'The Agency has also been able to meet increasing demands for information without a similar scale of increase in resources, also pointing to efficiency gains within the organisation'.
In the Agency we strive to give value for money across an enormous environmental agenda.
This is essential in today's climate of increased financial pressure and the growing number of organisations working on environmental issues.

General objectives for 2009–2013
To support policy development and evaluation within the environmental themes covered by the acquis communautaire and related areas by:
• ensuring full access, via SEIS and the EEA Environmental Data Centres, to the qualityassured data needed to support European-level work on indicators and integrated assessments;
• maintaining and developing relevant EEA indicators within the Indicator Management System;
One of the fundamental roles of the EEA is to support EU environmental policy by tracking and reporting on the outcomes of the implementation of EU environmental legislation across all EEA member countries.
This involves establishing and maintaining reporting mechanisms, developing the Shared Environmental Information System, implementing Inspire, quality assurance procedures, analytical frameworks and standardised outputs in terms of data sets, indicators and thematic integrated assessments for a number of environmental themes such as air quality and pollutant emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater and marine environments.
The work includes, inter alia, analyses of the costs of action/inaction, effectiveness evaluations, distance-to-target assessments in relation to agreed policy targets and long term reference values, and outlooks for the future in the 2020–2030 perspective.
• carrying out evaluations of the existing effectiveness of policies and outlooks for the future in the 2020–2030 perspective.
The work is divided into major environmental themes in line with those under the European Commission's 6th Environment Action Programme:
•Air quality•Air pollutant emissions • Biodiversity • Greenhouse gas emissions•Freshwater•Marine
The demand for work of this type is expected to continue and develop over the next five years as EU environmental policies and legislation evolve.
Highlights in the period will be: a global agreement in Copenhagen in autumn 2009 on cuts in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) after 2012; implementation of a revised EU emission trading scheme for 2008–2012; agreed national targets by 2020, for EU greenhouse gas emissions reductions; revision of the Directive on National Emissions Ceilings and Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directives in 2009, implementation of the new Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive, progress on meeting the target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010, the first round of River Basin Management Plans and related programmes of measures under the Water Framework Directive in 2009, and implementation of the recently adopted Marine Strategy Directive.
The EEA will build on and adapt its existing data flows, indicators and assessments to meet these changing needs
Air quality
Our main objective
To provide assessments of air quality and air pollution across Europe, especially in urban and rural areas, based on quality assured, up-to-date and where possible near-real-time data and indicators; in particular focusing on particles, ozone, toxic and other hazardous pollutants, sectoral emissions, progress towards and outlooks for the achievement of short- and long-term air quality policy targets and inputs into assessments of air quality impacts on human health and ecosystems.
Analysis

• contributing to the EEA's integrated environmental assessments and analyses of environment and health by making wider use of modelling techniques and advanced spatial mapping techniques and Inspire in our work; other hazardous pollutants in ambient air and the deposition of a variety of substances.
Policy highlights in the period of the next strategy will be the implementation of the new Clean Air for Europe Directive and its review (2013), the review of the Air Thematic Strategy (2010) and the current revision of the National Emissions Ceilings Directive.
Action
We will achieve our objective by:
• working closely in cooperation with Eionet, the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change, the GMES atmospheric services, Eurostat, JRC and other EC services, WHO, UNECE (the relevant programmes, centres and task forces under this Convention), the network of national reference laboratories on quality control/quality assurance of air quality monitoring, other providers of data such as regional bodies, cities, industry and scientific, research and societal institutes; and
• improving use of air quality information via multi-media, user-friendly, interactive services.
• providing up-to-date and where possible near real-time quality assured data, maps, indicators and streamlined access to relevant ambient air quality websites via SEIS and the EEA Data Centre on air;
• producing integrated and targeted assessments of air pollution and noise, the impacts on human health and the environment, and the effectiveness and co-benefits of related policies and measures;
1) The issue of indoor pollution is covered in the cross-cutting theme on Environment and health.
To provide assessments related to emissions of pollutants, including toxic and hazardous pollutants, to air and where relevant to other media.
This will include tracking progress towards, and providing outlooks for, the achievement of targets inter alia as defined in relevant EU and international legislation and evaluating the effectiveness of European policies and measures to reduce emissions.
Analysis the NEC Directive and the greenhouse gas Monitoring Mechanism;
• producing the EU annual emission inventory reports for the UNECE Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention and National Emissions Ceiling Directive and jointly with EMEP the review of national air emission inventory data;
Although emissions of key air pollutants have decreased in recent years, air pollution still causes substantial adverse impacts on human health, ecosystems and crops.
Polluting emissions in general arising from large and small installations, and diffuse sources, such as from transport, agriculture and households, continue to cause concern.
• providing assessments on synergies and tradeoffs between air pollutant emission and greenhouse gas emission reduction policies and on the effectiveness of selected policies to reduce key air pollutant emissions and subsequent effects on air quality;
In 2009, the UNECE LRTAP Gothenburg Protocol to abate acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone as well as both the National Emissions Ceilings (NEC) and the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directives (IPPC) will still be under revision.
In addition, towards the end of 2009 the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) will be introduced, replacing the present European Polluting Emissions Register (EPER).
• working closely in cooperation with Eionet and other providers of data, the EEA's European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change, the UNECE Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention (especially the EMEP programme, its centre on emissions inventories and projections and its task force on emission inventories and projections) and with the European Commission services (including Eurostat and JRC);
• providing up-to-date and where possible near-real-time quality assured data, indicators and streamlined access to relevant air pollutant emissions websites, via SEIS, Inspire and the EEA Data Centre on air;

• providing, via SEIS, Inspire and the EEA Environmental Data Centres on Biodiversity and Ecosystems and Land Use, quality assured data in support for European reporting initiatives, most notably the Nature Directives;
• producing analysis on the state and trends of individual species and habitats as required under relevant articles in the existing community legislation;
The next five years will see an expansion of the EU biodiversity policy area, due to an increased awareness of the significance of biodiversity and ecosystem services for human well being.
The focus will be on three policy priorities for 2009–2013: the protection of key species and habitats under the Birds and the Habitats Directives; the commitment to halt the loss of biodiversity in the EU by 2010 and report on progress using indicators (SEBI2010); and, a longer-term vision around maintaining the health and resilience of ecosystem services (see Section 2.3).
• reporting on progress towards the EU and global targets on halting/reducing the loss of biodiversity using the Streamlining European Biodiversity Indicators 2010;
• providing spatial analysis of the conflicts and potential trade offs that exist between biodiversity, economic development and social objectives with special attention to climate change and conservation objectives;
Bringing these priorities together is of concern for two reasons: first, because the loss of biodiversity, in particular species and habitats, results in a decline in the 'ecosystem services' which natural systems provide; and second, because these and the many other interconnections between the three priorities, require a coherent approach to data and analysis to avoid unnecessary parallel data collection streams.
• using such analytical inputs and results from EU funded research projects on biodiversity for the EEA's regular state of the environment and outlooks reports and the European Ecosystem Assessment (Eureca 2012); and
• improving the EEA's communications on species, habitats and their aggregation into indicators, that can be used by policy-makers, citizens and the media via multimedia channels, including the EC Biodiversity Clearing House Mechanism.
Greenhouse gas emissions
To monitor and assess progress towards achieving EU greenhouse gas emission policy targets (Kyoto and 2020), evaluate the effectiveness of EU climate change mitigation policies and measures, and support the development of long-term climate change mitigation strategies.
• providing annual reporting on member state experiences with EU ETS, expanded towards effectiveness evaluation of the ETS, Kyoto mechanisms projects and possibly also other carbon offsetting markets and projects;
• producing analyses and assessments of pathways to achieve a low-carbon and 'greener' economy.
These include integrated mitigation and adaptation outlooks and alternative future scenarios, linking socio-economic developments, emissions, carbon accounting systems and impacts on water quality, water quantity, biodiversity, soils, forests and oceans as sinks or sources, and co-benefits for air quality and public health;
Global warming will have far-reaching consequences.
Action to address global climate change is both technically feasible and affordable compared to the high costs of unabated climate change.
The Kyoto Protocol targets are a first step to be met by 2012.
The key existing relevant legislation is the emission effort sharing amongst member states to achieve the Kyoto target, the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), targeting power generation and energy intensive industry, and the EU GHG monitoring mechanism.
Substantial further greenhouse gas emission reductions are needed globally to achieve the target proposed by the EU for limiting change to a maximum temperature increase of + 2 °C above pre-industrial level.
Within UNFCCC a global post-Kyoto regime is being developed with agreement anticipated by the end of 2009 in Copenhagen.
• supporting the project of the European Commission on streamlining air emission and GHG emission data collection and reporting under various existing legislation, including the NEC Directive and the GHG Monitoring Mechanism;
• supporting the UNFCCC review and any technical issues arising from the UNFCCC negotiation process; and

Freshwater
To support European policies related to water quality and quantity by providing integrated assessments of water quality, quantity and use, to track progress and provide outlooks on the achievement of policy targets and quality assurance schemes, supported by up-to-date, and where possible near-real-time, data, indicators, models and analyses.
• providing integrated assessments of water pollution, water quantity and the effectiveness of policies using the Drivers, Pressures, State, Impacts and Responses framework, the concepts of Integrated Water Resource Management, ecosystem services, resource accounting, resilience and spatial mapping;

• providing assessments of water goods and services highlighting the wider context of ecosystems, biodiversity and the impacts of invasive alien species, the effects of salt-water intrusion, flooding and temperature shifts;
In the EU, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and related water directives provide an integrated framework within which to address these many and varied challenges to water management.
The first round of River Basin Management Plans and related Programmes of Measures in 2009 mark the crossing of an important threshold from preparation to action in the implementation of the WFD.
Proper implementation requires continued integration across sectoral activities (agriculture, rural development, economy, energy, transport, water infrastructure), and needs to be supported by intense information exchange between relevant actors on good practice and suitable, efficient measures.
• providing user-friendly access to reports, data, including near-real time, indicators, information plus related analytical tools; and
• improving the public understanding of the issues of water quality and quantity and climate change via multi-media, user-friendly interactive services.

• contributing to the establishment of the GMES marine core services;
The sum of human pressures on the marine environment from fishing, energy and resource exploration and exploitation, tourism, shipping and pollution is increasing, and the general state of marine ecosystems across Europe is poor.
Climate change is adding to the pressures, leading to impacts such as higher temperatures, ocean acidification, which are already decreasing the ability of seas and oceans to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and for some marine biota to function.
EU policy has now adopted an 'ecosystem approach' to the management of human activities on the marine environment through its strategies and directives.
• increasing our synergies with the UN and regional marine conventions, the scientific community and organised civil society in the development of EEA integrated marine assessments to ensure that these better reflect the conditions in each European regional sea; and
Successful implementation at the pan-European scale will require a far better characterisation of the current situation, past trends and outlooks via comparable data and information, including socio-economic drivers and pressures and an improved view of the options for and environmental consequences of current and future uses of the marine environment and regional seas.
We will achieve our objective by:
• producing integrated assessments of the marine environment and the effectiveness of EU policies, including biodiversity, water quality, fisheries and maritime issues, and the state and value of marine ecosystem goods and services under different policy-relevant scenarios, and contributing to marine assessments for the Baltic under the Swedish Presidency in 2009, the Spanish Presidency in 2010, for Horizon 2020 in the Mediterranean, on the Arctic for the EC and Arctic and Nordic Councils and for Eureca 2012.

Strategic area 2
Cross-cutting themes
• putting these methods to work more explicitly across a range of cross-cutting themes in this strategic area such as sectoral integration, climate change, sustainable consumption and production and maritime, territorial and cohesion policies;
• paying special attention to issues that are priorities for the SOER 2010, Eureca 2012 and IPCC 2013; and
Demand for cross-cutting integrated analyses is growing in recognition of rapidly changing realities.
Europe's consumption and production patterns, their influence on climate change and biodiversity, how they are served by ecosystems around the world, and how these patterns might be adapted in the face of change, are clearly in focus.
The requirement for connected information on all these processes is growing as a result.
In a globalised economy where individuals, businesses and governments can exert a global reach, many different types of policy can affect the resilience of the natural environment and the resources it provides whether on land or at sea.
• building alliances and capacities within our networks to undertake such cross-cutting analyses and assessments within the context of SEIS.
The work is divided into the ten major cross-cutting themes that occur across the European Union's political and environmental landscape:
From transport to energy, agriculture to trade, tourism to people's well-being, all human activities can manifest themselves in a way that can have cascading sets of unintended consequences, leading us potentially to rapid non-linear changes and tipping points for the natural environment.
Many uncertainties underlie these realities and how they may play out.
But it is clear that environment and economy have not been equal partners in this relationship.
General objective for 2009–2013
To support policy development and evaluation within the cross-cutting themes by:
•Climate change impacts•Vulnerability and adaptation •Ecosystems•Environment and health•Maritime•Sustainable consumption and production and waste•Land use•Agriculture and forestry•Energy•Transport
• building on the achievements of the 2004–2008 strategy with respect to the methods and analyses needed to generate cross-cutting assessments such as spatial analysis, impact indicators, outlooks and scenarios, policy effectiveness evaluations, economics;
To contribute directly to EU policy developments on climate change impacts by refining relevant indicators, producing assessments, combined with socio-economic factors in Europe, using past trends, now-casting, spatial analysis, forward looking assessments, and policy effectiveness analysis including economic aspects.
• improving and maintaining information, data, indicators and models on impacts in the EEA Environmental Data Centre on Climate Change and link it to information and data in the Environmental Data Centres on water, biodiversity and land use;
Climate change impacts on natural resources and human activities are expected to continue despite strong action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Even if the EU target of limiting temperature increase to not more than + 2 °C is achieved, it still means that there will be many impacts.
Climate change is an additional pressure on natural and human systems, which are already under increasing pressures from globalisation and rising consumption patterns across the world.
• producing a range of climate change impacts and related assessments in thematic areas linked to wider strategies on environment and sustainability, for the SOER 2010 and Eureca 2012 assessments, and regular updating of the indicator-based assessment on climate change impacts in Europe to respond to emerging demands for support;
• working with research teams across Europe to improve the regionalisation of forward studies of climate change impacts;
In 2008, the EEA in partnership with the Joint Research Centre and World Health Organisation Europe produced its climate impacts report based on more than 40 indicators covering physical, biological and health impacts.
The conclusions were that in every aspect, the changes associated with climate change were widespread and increasing.
Data from the various global observing and in-situ measurement programmes also show that we are experiencing conditions outside the most pessimistic estimates from the IPCC 2007 report.
• developing models and data in partnership with ECMWF to create an down-scaled climate archive for hindcasting and forecasting Europe's climate at sub-regional spatial scales; and
• creating multi-media, user-friendly, multilingual products on the extent of climate change impacts.
2.2 Vulnerability and adaptation
To support new EU and European Policy developments on vulnerability and adaptation and on disaster prevention and management by developing online access to relevant environmental information, observations for rapid spatial mapping and decision-support tools, via SEIS and GMES services to help Member States' meet their objectives for dealing with climate change impacts, adaptation, vulnerability mapping, disaster prevention and management.
• collecting, managing and assessing policy-relevant data on a European level for cross-border environmental vulnerability mapping in EU and neighbouring countries in collaboration with other European organisations (i.e. DG ENV, JRC, EMSA, ESA);
Vulnerability of natural resources and human activities is increasing in Europe as a consequence of climate change.
This includes intensification of extreme temperatures, precipitation, floods, wind storms, droughts, forest fires, intensified land use, industrial development, urban expansion, construction of infrastructure and loss of biodiversity.
The EU's 2007 green paper on adapting to climate change stresses the increased risk of damage to people, infrastructure and environment in the EU and draws attention to the need for early action and policy response in Europe.
• reporting on national climate adaptation plans and provide guidance and support for information exchange on regional prevention, management and adaptation strategies and best practice;
Under the UN FCCC, a 5-year work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation is being implemented.
A global post-Kyoto regime is being developed including adaptation to climate change, with agreement planned for end of 2009 in Copenhagen.
• assessing the environmental impacts of natural disasters and industrial accidents in Europe as well as existing measures for their management and prevention, to complement the information on economic loss and social impact collected by other organisations;
The European Commission is now preparing a White Paper on adaptation with options for integrating adaptation into EU policies across the most vulnerable regions. The European Commission is also planning a Communication on a Community initiative in the field of disaster prevention aimed at bringing together information in a more systematic way to support actions across the EU.
• supporting the creation of a Community clearing house mechanism for exchanging information and best practice on disaster prevention and management, to be developed with networks of relevant actors in disaster prevention and management across Europe; and
• developing of a prototype 'European Clearing House on Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation' to provide access to European climate change data and scenarios with information on actions and good practice, including economic costs, linked to the EEA's Climate Change data centre and consistent with a clearing house on disaster prevention and management.
To support the inclusion of an ecosystems and services perspective into the evaluation of present and future EU thematic policies and sectoral development in international and regional policy arenas, and within the EEA's indicator frameworks, key reporting exercises and integrated assessments such as SOER 2010 and Eureca 2012.

• supporting The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, and the UNEP Global Green New Deal initiative in relation to resource accounting, documenting the resilience of ecosystems, and providing analyses of their valuation;
Ecosystem services represent the transformation of a number of natural assets into products that people need, benefit from and value.
They include provisioning services — products obtained from ecosystems, including for example, genetic resources, food and fibre, fresh-water; regulating services — benefits from the regulation of ecosystems processes, including flood and disease control, climate, water and human health; cultural services — including non-tangible benefits such as recreation, aesthetic values and spiritual enrichment; and supporting services — those that are necessary for the production of all other ecosystems services, including biomass production, clear air, nutrient cycling, water cycling.
• increasing awareness about the value and use of natural resources through analyses of market-based mechanisms for ecosystems services;
• improving knowledge about thresholds and resilience in Europe's ecosystems and in particular in relation to climate change e.g. carbon absorption, trophic dynamics, provisioning and fragmentation of the landscape;
• maximising the use of existing data and spatial modelling techniques to support analysis of the health and resilience of ecosystem services within Europe and globally in terms of Europe's footprint and emerging sectoral demands;
These natural services are not recognised adequately by economic markets, government policies and land management practices, and accordingly many ecosystems services are in danger of being lost or are in serious danger of losing their resilience.
Wider implementation of the ecosystem services concept in Europe, linked to a follow-up of the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the G8+5 initiative for the 2010 meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity on the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity, will add strong economic arguments that can both change policy priorities, action and financing within the environmental policy arena, as well as capturing the attention of other stakeholders from different sectors to increase their awareness of the economic significance of change.

• testing the applicability of various methodological approaches, including biomonitoring, to estimate both adverse and beneficial impacts of pollutants (including plastics, endocrine disruptors, GM crops for fuel and fibre) in the environment and ecosystems (including ambient and indoor air, water and soil) on ecosystem functioning and human health and wellbeing;
It is also reflected in a new Community Action Programme 2008–2013 in the field of health; the EU Environment and Health Action Plan 2004–2010; the renewed EU Sustainable Development Strategy; and in the major EU chemical policies, and the World Health Organisation Children and Environment Health Action Programme.
Mid-term evaluations of these programmes recognised the progress made but indicated strongly the need for intensive work in the future.
• examining the environmental burden of pollutants and chemicals, including aspects of age, socio-economic status and migrational background;
• providing inputs for all major EEA assessments, including SOER 2010 and Eureca 2012, its regional assessments, and various international reports and assessments such as the UN Environment for Europe Ministerial Conference;
• producing a report on Bradford-Hill work on causality criteria in the environment and health arena;
At the recent EU Council, health ministers underlined the need for early action, the benefits of preventive and precautionary measures and the need for the development of tools for anticipating, preventing and responding to potential threats from emerging and re-emerging issues such as nanotechnology, and to strengthen the involvement of relevant stakeholders through partnerships across sectors at all levels.
They also called for information on environmental determinants with positive health impacts such as biodiverse environments, non-motorised means of transport and housing conditions.
• cooperating with key partners on significant EU inter-institutional processes, and on major events and meetings, such as WHO Ministerial Conference and the 2009 European Public Health Association conference; and
• improving decision-support tools on dealing with uncertainty, risk, ignorance and precaution within key environment and health issues.

• providing the maritime part and support the integrated approach in the annotated outline for Marine/Maritime issues in SOER 2010, with a focus on evaluation of effectiveness of marine spatial planning policies and practices;
New and more extensive monitoring and analytical methods are now needed for integrated assessments.
These will build on the developments in technology and information systems that are already underway, such as the EU Atlas of the seas, and the specific support to the European Marine Observation and Data network (EMODNET) with its links to WISE-marine and SEIS.
These will help connect source organisations and provide online and shared access to the necessary data, to support marine spatial planning and state of the environment reporting.
• contributing to assess the relevant maritime policy as input to related issues (e.g. tourism, transport) as well as other regional aspects for the biennial synthesis progress report Horizon 2020, the Baltic Sea Region Strategy under the Swedish Presidency in 2009 and the Spanish Presidency in 2010; and

• supporting the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive and the Thematic Strategy on Waste Prevention and Recycling through analyses of various waste streams;
• working with business and SMEs to share experiences and good practice on sustainable business strategies, corporate social responsibility, EMAS and the role of retailers;
The importance of sustainable consumption and production (SCP), including the generation of waste and use of resources, is reflected in policy priorities and plans, in particular the UNCSD 2010–2011 review of SCP and waste, the EU Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy, the 2010 revision of the thematic strategies on sustainable use of natural resources and on waste prevention and recycling, other EU waste policies including the revision of the Waste Framework Directive and national policies on SCP, resources and waste.
It is also reflected in the increased business focus on corporate social responsibility, efficiency in resource use and environmental management systems, and the greater focus on sustainable consumption patterns across Europe.
• strengthening work on sustainable production and eco-innovation, in cooperation with OECD;
• supporting neighbouring countries on SCP and waste information needs, especially the Mediterranean countries within the Horizon 2020 initiative and EEA collaborating West Balkan countries; and

• working with ESPON2013 to define and test a new set of territorial indicators to support spatial planning and understanding of different development perspectives;
• providing assessments of European territorial developments using advanced spatial analytical techniques, past trends, now casting, forward looking assessments, policy effectiveness analysis including the economics of different paths, in partnership especially with DG Regio, JRC and Eurostat;
The new EU Lisbon Treaty underlines the fact that a policy tool for coordination, coherence and synergies of sectoral policies is indispensable for the sustainable spatial development and multi-level governance system of the European continent.
• working with Eurostat, the UN and national statistical offices to ensure that EEA-led land, water and ecosystem accounts will become a global standard within the UN-Environmental Accounting framework;
• fully exploiting the completed 2006 Corine land cover inventory and related data bases, in particular the high-resolution soil sealing information;
Over the past decade the Agency has analysed conflicts over the use of space and land-based resources in Europe and observed that they will be exacerbated by urbanisation, transport growth, shifts in agricultural priorities, new forms of tourism, evolving societal aspirations around mobility and housing, demography and the continuous changes to the territorial landscape from climate change putting at risk ecological and social resilience.
• supporting the development of the GMES Land services and Global Observing Systems; and
• undertaking selected regional and thematic assessments (e.g. on urban, mountain and rural areas, tourism, transport and noise mapping, impacts of soil erosion, land pricing and taxes) and provide inputs to SOER 2010 and Eureca 2012.
• integrating all relevant geo-spatial datasets and information at the European level via SEIS, Inspire and the Land Use Data Centre, including an operational data base on noise maps and data as part of ReportNet implementation for Environmental Noise Directive;
2.8 Agriculture and forestry
To provide integrated analyses of land use trends in agriculture and forestry through assessments of their current and future impact on water, soils, air quality, biodiversity and landscapes.
This will help to assess the impact of new societal demands, demographic and technological trends on the natural environment and form a basis for policy evaluation and feedback into related sectoral and environmental policies.
• integrating economic and biophysical models and data to assess the driving forces behind the environmental impacts of socio-economic trends to inform sector policy debates, in agriculture, bioenergy and rural development policies;
• extending sector-related indicators ets, spatial analyses and databases on farm practices and new land use trends, e.g. the combined impact of food, feed and biomass production on water resources, fertiliser and pesticide use, tillage methods, livestock housing, in cooperation with Commission Services and UNEP;
The use of agricultural and forestry land in Europe for producing primary material (food, feed, biomass for energy and material purposes) will become more intensive in the coming decades.
This derives from new demands, advances in technology (e.g. enzymatic digestion of cellulosic material, engineering of food properties, crop breeding including genetically modified organisms etc.) and changes in farming practices.
Forestry and agriculture increasingly deliver into shared end uses for buildings, energy and biomaterials, which lead to higher demands on the available land area.
The expected impacts of climate change and land conversion for the urban and service sectors will increase resulting pressures on water and soil resources as well as affect biodiversity, landscapes and air quality.
The EEA has worked on agri -environment indicators, developed the concept of high nature value farmland and investigated policy integration, e.g. with regard to bioenergy production.
• undertaking assessments of critical issues such as the carbon balance associated with land use change, both within Europe and globally, examine the environmental impacts of alien species and genetically modified crops especially for bioenergy and fibre;
• supporting efforts to develop environmental and ecosystem accounts to inform analyses of adaptation to and mitigation of climate change and provide these as inputs to the EEA's assessments including Eureca 2012 and SOER 2010.
To provide integrated assessments, analyses of how changes in policy and operations within the energy sector contribute to mitigating climate change, affect human health and the environment, the costs and benefits, progress towards meeting policy targets and the environmental effectiveness, supported by up-to-date data, models and indicators.

• providing regular updates on energy and environment indicators, including energy subsidies, and inputs to the EEA integrated assessments; and
Energy policy will continue to play a central role in combating climate change while at the same time ensuring a secure supply of energy in Europe.
Energy production and consumption, including renewable energy such as bioenergy, have substantial impacts on human health and the environment, through emissions of air pollutants, waste generation, soil damage, oil spills etc.
The European Commission is developing further the legislative package on energy and climate change policies agreed in December 2008 including actions towards the achievement of the targets by 2020, for renewable energy, road transport fuel and energy efficiency, the establishment of a framework for carbon capture and storage and development of demonstration plants.
Further efforts are also being made in energy efficiency, reducing energy demand, advancing the establishment of a true internal energy market, stimulating energy research and technology development and enhancing international cooperation on energy issues.
European efforts in this area are tightly coupled to those in the rest of the world.
• assessing the pressures from energy production and consumption on the environment including energy efficiency and demand-side policies, choice of fuels, climate change mitigation/energy security pathway and the costs, benefits and tradeoffs concerning environmental aspects, such as water and biodiversity, of these pathways.
To assess the impacts of transport on human health and the environment with the help of transport and environment indicators, models and scenarios.
This will include, inter alia, tracking progress towards environmentally related policy targets for transport and seeking to demonstrate possible new solutions for access and sustainable mobility.
• maintaining, developing and streamlining transport and environment indicators and working with Eurostat, ITF/OECD and the European Commission to supplement the EEA's data collection via Eionet partners in particular in the areas of transport noise assessments, land use and patterns of goods transport;
Transport is an integral part of most of the activities that together form the basis of a nation's Gross Domestic Product.
Transport volumes grow more or less in parallel with the economy and thus influence a number of environmental issues, with climate change, habitat loss, noise and air pollution the most prominent.
Even if the growth in emissions of greenhouse gases from the transport sector has slowed recently, projections for the future foresee a notable growth if no additional mitigating measures are implemented.
The EU is therefore considering a range of policies and measures such as inclusion of aviation in
• producing indicator-based assessments of the transport sector's progress in integrating environmental considerations into its policies as input to EEA's regular integrated and cross-cutting assessments; the EU emission trading system; reducing CO2
• analysing traffic's contribution to air quality and noise in Europe's cities; emissions from cars; and infrastructure charging schemes.
However, we should avoid transport being only associated with climate change; the Greening Transport package is a step in broadening out the discussion.
• building geographically specific transport emission inventories;
• informing the process of improving the environmental performance of international aviation and maritime transport, and their inclusion into a post Kyoto regime on climate change mitigation, through the provision of relevant information focusing mainly on emission of air pollutants and of greenhouse gases; and
To a large degree transport policy development is guided by the aim of creating a more 'sustainable transport system', with access and mobility at its heart.
But as yet these terms are not operational and do not facilitate environmental improvements.
In response to the increasingly ambitious greenhouse gas emission targets there is a need to develop sector specific targets.
To ensure any ancillary benefits these targets should also cover all the main aspects (air emissions, noise, habitat loss, etc) of a 'sustainable transport system' and its use.
• developing scenarios for a sustainable transport system, examining energy efficiency, sustainable mobility and access, and synergies with neighbourhood and district development by identifying and characterising different possible measures, technology options, demand management options and user behavior options, in cooperation with the transport industry, JRC and European Commission services.
Strategic area 3
Integrated environmental assessment
To ensure that these assessments support decision-making processes and policy development, increasing emphasis will be given to four elements:
There is an increasing demand to carry out or contribute to environmental assessments of different geographical areas in Europe, neighbouring countries and globally.
These assessments are needed to help frame, support and evaluate the progress of a wide range of policy processes.
There is also an increased demand to include economic information, forward looking perspectives and to address uncertainties.
However, this growth in the number and diversity of assessments is leading to inefficiencies, overlaps and inconsistencies, which can undermine their effectiveness.
• integrated environmental policy analysis and assessments of national and regional policies and actions to secure the environment e.g. in transport and infrastructure, agriculture (biotechnologies and transgenic organisms) energy and industry (sustainable production and consumption and nanotechnologies) and in the finance (insurance), and commerce (distribution);
• decision-making under conditions of risk, uncertainty and complexity and the use of decision support tools;
• providing more social and economic analyses to help put the interconnectedness of the environment into the mainstream of societal thinking; and
• intensifying the use of scenarios and other forward looking methods to support the development of sustainable futures.
In line with its founding Regulation, the EEA is required to publish every five years a report of the state and outlook of the European Environment.
The next report is due in 2010.
Since its inception, the EEA has also published four pan-European assessments, covering the countries of eastern Europe, central Asia and the Caucasus, two focused on the Mediterranean and two on the Arctic.
In addition, we have paid increasing attention to scenario development and forward studies, economic evaluation and historical analyses of environmental and health issues to improve policy evelopment and decision-making under conditions of high uncertainty and complexity.
The activities under this strategic area are found under five themes:
Over the next five years, the EEA will deliver its main five-year reporting and assessment and with partners develop and contribute to other regional, pan-European and global assessments.
It will also aim to provide a strong basis for the EU Environment Action Programme.
3.1 Integrated environmental assessment
To develop, publish and communicate a cutting-edge report in 2010 on the state and outlook for the environment of Europe and establish a long-term strategy with our networks and partners to coordinate future global, regional, thematic and sectoral assessments and reports.
The EEA is mandated 'to publish a report on the state of, trends in and the prospects for the environment every five years, supplemented byindicator reports focusing upon specific issues' (Article 2 of EEA Establishing Regulation).
The next state and outlook of the environment report is due in 2010.
• coordinating inputs from across the thematic activities, SEIS and the core sets of indicators in Europe (including those managed by Eurostat) to produce a thematic indicator-based integrated environmental assessment of the environmental trends and outlooks in Europe;
• running a country-focused process for developing country analyses and a scorecard and on this basis develop a learning-oriented comparative assessment of country level state of action, situations and responses;
The EEA 5-year flagship reports provide a strategic stocktaking and forward-looking assessment of environmental issues within the context of sustainability in the EU Member States, candidate and potential candidate countries.
The reports contribute to strategic environmentrelated policy-making at the European level, the evaluation of EU environmental action programmes and strategies and to future agenda setting.
• improving communication and dissemination of the assessment via multi-media, user-friendly, multilingual information;
• producing a forward-looking cross-cutting integrated assessment of environmental issues which will look at how, in a sustainability perspective, the interaction between environmental issues and European and global socio-economic developments may develop under different plausible scenarios and how they could impact on Europe, its neighbours and other parts of the world;
Recognising the wide interest in the SOER 2010, differentiated products and multimedia will be designed to suit the different audiences, including assessments on thematic issues and at country levels.
• developing a long-term strategy for integrated environmental assessments in the region covering the ongoing 5-year reporting cycle and other regional, global and issue orientated assessment needs.
A new improved perspective on assessments will be put in place at the beginning of the new strategy to enable the EEA to deliver on its main five-year reporting mandate and respond to these multiple requests coherently, effectively and efficiently.
3.2 Regional and global assessment
To plan, prepare, contribute to and deliver regional assessments in support of various policies and political processes in line with EEA's long-term Strategy for integrated assessments and 5-year reporting.
• providing links and easy access to SEIS, Reportnet and the various tools for undertaking integrated assessments to enable others in the wider community make best use of these developments;
• cooperating with Mediterranean Action Programme, Eurostat and other partners to organise a regular reporting process under Horizon 2020, publishing five-yearly and biennial reports on the Mediterranean environment;
• planning and preparing the fifth pan-European assessment report;
Common geographical and environmental patterns characterise specific areas in Europe, such as coastal regions or mountain ranges.
They correspond on the one hand to the reality of Europe's landscape diversity and, on the other, to some form of targeted processes and policies or more generally territorial cohesion.
Analysing the environmental status of these diverse areas, such as coastal, urban, rural, mountain, is thus rooted in the particular socio-economic characteristics of the different areas and current and historical land use patterns.
This has important consequences as many policies and decision-making scenarios need to consider a wide range of interactions; for example urban sprawl into rural areas; the impact of urbanisation in coastal areas on ecosystems services; the role of mountain agriculture in maintaining high-value nature farmland.
The EEA is involved in the production of a number of regional assessments and State of Environment reporting processes.
• participating in the UNGA assessment of assessments for the marine environment, UNEP-GEO, other UNEP DEWA activities and other UN assessments via expert groups and chairmanship of panels;
• identifying the needs for and providing specific tailor-made assessments on the state of the Arctic environment;
Examples include work under the European Neighbourhood Policy and Central Asia Strategy; the coordination and production of a scorecard in the context of the Mediterranean Horizon 2020 process, to measure progress on the basis of an agreed set of indicators; the UNGA global assessment of assessments to develop a regular process for assessing the marine environment and assessments for the Arctic and key ecosystems such as wetlands and alpine areas.
• identifying the needs for and developing relevant assessments to support Cohesion policies, spatial planning and areas defined by their ecological relatedness (e.g. coasts, inland seas, urban, rural and mountain areas); and
• improving communication and dissemination on the importance and basis of integrated assessment via multi-media, user-friendly, multilingual information.
3.3 Decision support
To promote better and more widely accepted understanding of the implications of systems science, multi-causality, uncertainty and the sources of knowledge in order to support timely, participatory, robust and adaptive decision-making.
• developing retrospective analyses of past environmental decision-making (e.g. Late lessons from early warnings vol. 2) in order to provide a greater knowledge-base from which to identify and implement future policy actions that are timely, robust and adaptive;
• promoting long-term monitoring of surprise-sensitive parameters so as to better anticipate perturbations in biological and health systems;
• exploring diverse methods for achieving effective public participation in identifying and managing emerging ecological and health issues;
• developing and using decision support tools in key areas, such as climate change, adaptation, ecosystem valuation and vulnerability assessments;
There is growing scientific awareness that environmental, ecological and health issues are more complex, multi-causal and inter-connected than previously understood.
Systems science, non–linear dynamics and threshold phenomena are characteristics of most environmental and health issues, such as: climate change; the four priority diseases and disorders of the EU Action Plan on Environment and Health; ecosystems health; and biodiversity loss.
Timely responses by governments, and increasingly by civil society, to perturbations in such complex ecological and biological systems involve taking action on lower strengths and sometimes different types of evidence, (e.g. indigenous knowledge, relevant knowledge rather than precise data), if the precautionary prevention of harm is to be achieved.
Such decisions need to be taken in light of a broader knowledge base, in part derived from public participation, supported by increased awareness of the effectiveness and consequences of previous actions, or inactions, on emerging issues and early warnings.
• analysing and helping to harmonise more transparent approaches to the evaluation of scientific and other forms of knowledge, such as indigenous knowledge, and to support the wider use of the precautionary principle;
Public and stakeholder participation is also increasingly recognised as a component of effective decision-making on issues that arise from complex systems such as: river basin management; strategic impact assessment; climate change adaptation; land management; nature protection; spatial planning: strategic futures development; the demand-side management of transport, water, energy and resource use; and the lay monitoring of environmental change.
• improving and simplifying the terminology used to characterise cause-effect relationships and uncertainties in ecological and biological systems, by fostering the widespread adoption of such terminology;
• developing with partners a better understanding of the types of jurisprudence that will properly reflect the needs of the environment; and
• improving awareness of these issues via workshops with a broad range of stakeholders.
To support and deliver integrated economic analysis including modelling across themes (biodiversity, climate change, marine, spatial planning, environment and health) and driving forces (agriculture, transport, (bio)energy) with the focus on cost of policy inaction, cost of measures, benefits of improved environmental quality and ecosystems services, and the role and impact of market-based instruments and environmental tax reform.
Central to these activities will be the maintenance of data repositories.
• developing integrated analysis of economic drivers and environmental problems and policy tools;
• building inventories and assessments of the role of market-based solutions and environmental tax reforms;
There is an increasing focus on economic damage and welfare loss in the case of inadequate action or inaction.
At the same time policies and measures must induce effective and least-cost solutions.
The economic component of environmental analysis and evaluations is getting stronger as reflected in the further development of methods such as ex-ante-type cost of policy inaction, impact assessments and integrated analysis, and ex-post evaluations.
Market-based instruments are increasingly recognised as potentially cost-saving tools, and environmental tax reform aims to reconcile environmental, fiscal and social objectives.
• making cost of inaction related valuations of market and non-market damage to ecosystem services and human welfare as input into European eco-assessment programmes;
• performing integrated analyses of environmental consequences and resources efficiency of main driving forces and of solutions with focus on market-based approaches, such as carbon markets and environmental taxation;
• carrying out an analysis of environmental tax reform as a response to long-term sustainable reconciliation of environmental, economic/fiscal and social objectives; and
• further developing methodologies, including benefit transfer, for scaling up of non-market valuation case study results, and valuation in land and ecosystem accounting.
To help expand strategic decision-making among EEA's major clients and partners by further developing scenario-based assessments in specific areas, such as the forward looking component of major EEA assessments, promoting capacity building actions and by making better use of existing processes, information and methods to provide user-tailored options for the future.
• continuing to support ongoing EEA assessment processes and especially the future analysis for the SOER 2010,and for the European Ecosystem Assessment (Eureca 2012);
The importance of future studies and especially scenarios in decision-making, are becoming increasingly recognised as the complexity, increased risk and uncertainty of environmental problems are themselves becoming increasingly apparent.
• fostering the use of scenarios and nowcasting techniques in strategic decision-making by developing guidelines, best-practice and web-based training tools;
• initiating new forward looking/scenario assessments in specific areas, regions and topics;
In its first years of operation the EEA concentrated its effort in this area on integrating the forward look into its main assessments covering the EU (SOER) and looking into the implementation of Community environmental policy through distance-to-target analysis.
Following the analysis presented in the 1999 five-year state and outlook report, and the amended Regulation, the EEA was requested to integrate a forward-looking component into its assessments.
• further exploring the current use impacts and effectiveness of scenarios in strategic environmental decision-making;
• further developing information systems via SEIS for forward looking information and developing better tailored tools to manage forward-looking information; and
Consequently, the EEA work was expanded beyond the SOER reports, into thematic areas and beyond existing legislation and the borders of the Europe.
During the last strategy period, the main bulk of work consisted of the wide assessment processes involved in the 2005 five-year state and outlook report and for the 2007 'Environment for Europe' Belgrade Conference.
In addition, contributions were made to the UNEP Global Environmental Outlook process.
Furthermore, through the highly acclaimed scenarios work PRELUDE, the potential of scenarios for framing issues in the early stages of the policy cycle, and a way of inducing strategic thinking in policy-making has been widely demonstrated.
Strategic area 4
Information services and communications
Over the course of the Strategy, the EEA aims to ensure its website becomes a world-recognised portal for providing timely and relevant environmental information on the state and outlook of Europe's environment.
The aim is to provide products and services with a high readability, usability and message consistency for the EEA's multilingual user community.
The demand for easy to understand, up-to-date information has grown significantly even during the course of the 2004–2008 strategy.
This demand comes from both political decision-makers and from European citizens, who increasingly wish to see full transparency with respect to information provided by public bodies.
Alongside this development, the rapid evolution in new information technologies provides us with tools to communicate more effectively.
The website will evolve from one that stores documents into an interactive site and portal that supports two-way communications and can be effective in helping to improve the quality and spread of environmental education.
We will continue to focus on writing regular news items for the web and making the best possible use of multimedia techniques to maximise outreach and impact of EEA messages.
Over the next five years the EEA will seek to provide Europe's decision-makers and citizens with the independent information they need to make informed choices about the environment and raise awareness about the environment by communicating our messages in a transparent, understandable way to as broad an audience as possible.
Work in this strategic area will be under two themes:
•Shared Environmental Information System•Communications
The EEA information services and communications are supported by many initiatives across Europe in which the EEA is called upon to provide support, including the Shared Environmental Information System, the Inspire Directive on the provision of spatial information, the Aarhus Convention on access to environmental information and GMES — the EU's technical flagship aimed at improving integration of in-situ and space-based monitoring.
4.1 Shared Environmental Information System
To modernise the current reporting systems towards a network of decentralised systems providing online access to data that are managed as close to the source as possible and improving quality and the timeliness of information.
EEA and Eionet will work together with the European Commission and other international stakeholders to implement the system.
EEA will achieve this by building further on the systems and tools developed for reporting (Reportnet), the emerging initiatives related to e-Government, the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (Inspire), GMES, the Global Earth Observation (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).
In February 2008, the European Commission adopted a Communication proposing to improve, modernise and streamline current environmental information systems by establishing a European Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS).
• progressively adapt Reportnet towards a tool to support the proposed revised standardised reporting directive and to speed up the process of data availability online;
SEIS is a distributed, integrated, web-enabled information system based on a network of public information providers sharing environmental data and information.
It is built on existing e-infrastructure, systems and services in the Member States and EU institutions, especially those of the EEA and Eionet.
• focusing on our European data management, including streamlining priority dataflows with Eionet, coordination of the in-situ component of GMES and the management of 5 thematic Environmental Data Centres to offer a wealth of European environmental datasets in suitable formats for various users;
• further developing our spatial data infrastructure in line with the forthcoming implementing rules of Inspire, to become the backbone for SEIS;
• developing applications and services related to air, marine and terrestrial environmental monitoring and observations using improved in-situ and space-based monitoring derived from GMES and GEO/GEOSS;
The system aims to tie in better all existing data flows and information related to EU environmental policies and legislation including the implementation of the infrastructure for spatial information in Europe Inspire, and other data and real time observations related to emerging environmental priorities, and services coming from GMES.
It will provide easily accessible information to both policy-makers and citizens.
A major challenge will be to develop SEIS as a platform that also can be used for two-way communication on the environment, namely enabling users to upload and share their information with others from local to global level.
• ensuring system maintenance and management, providing high quality 24/7 data and information services; and
• continuously improving our EEA website, as main portal for providing timely and relevant information on Europe's environment.
4.2 Communications
To serve our primary target groups of Europe's decision-makers and influencers while also reaching as broad an audience as possible, by working closely with our institutional networks throughout Europe and with international and national media; promoting EEA strategic messages in a proactive, responsive way in order to contribute to political and public agendas; developing more environmental educational materials for European citizens; establishing effective two-way communication; engaging in dialogue with target groups to understand their information needs; and giving the right information at the right time, so it has most impact.
Commission and the European Parliament, the Presidency-in-office of the Council of Ministers and the public interests in different regions of Europe;
• expanding our outreach to cover more sectors engaged in environmental policy-making, research and education, and meeting their needs for environmental information when possible;
Our communications strategy is a living document designed to provide Europe's decision-makers and citizens with the independent information they need to make informed choices about the environment; raise awareness on the environment by communicating our messages in a transparent, understandable way to as broad an audience as possible; increasing awareness of the importance of environmental education throughout European; and increase the profile of the Agency and its network as being the key providers of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information on Europe's environment.
• strengthening and widening our media network and using it to multiply the effect of our messages and increase the visibility of the Agency as a key provider of environmental information;
• building an end-to-end communications programme in the Agency, fostering strong internal communications and communications training for EEA staff;
• tailoring our outputs for multiple purposes and audiences, and using a variety of channels to deliver them;
• implementing a more targeted media approach, selecting the media we wish to work with depending on the messages we want to get across and the target group we aim to reach;
• meeting the demand for brief, easy-to-read presentations of the main messages of our outputs, a common requirement of all our target groups, both experts and generalists;
• creating special web-based education materials;
• investing in the multimedia content of our website so that it becomes a world-recognised portal for providing timely and relevant environmental information on the state and outlook of Europe's environment;
• strengthening communication with younger audiences by leveraging the EEA's main messages for various outputs suitable for children and for broader education purposes; and
• monitoring the effectiveness of our activities to ensure two-way communication and dialogue.

‘Robust, far-sighted policy requires better, more detailed information.
We have made a lot of progress in this direction.
But we are only beginning to realise the full potential of environmental information.
The EEA seeks to drive technology, particularly the internet, in new directions in terms of its interaction with the environment through the Shared Environmental Information System for Europe (SEIS).’
Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director
Other important partners and sources of information for the EEA are European and international organisations, such as the Statistical Office (Eurostat) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO).
The information provided by the EEA comes from a wide range of sources.
A network of national environmental bodies was set up to work with the EEA — the European environmental information and observation network (Eionet) — which involves more than 300 institutions across Europe.
The EEA is responsible for developing the network and coordinating its activities.
To do this, we work closely with national focal points (NFPs) — typically national environment agencies or environment ministries in member countries.
They are responsible for coordinating the activities of Eionet at national level.
The main tasks for the national focal points are to develop and maintain the national network, identify national information
The EEA cooperates closely with these organisations in producing information and assessments for its clients and target groups.

Better management of municipal waste will reduce greenhouse gas emissions
•The amount of municipal waste is expected to grow by 25 % from 2005 to 2020.
•Increased recovery of waste, and diverting waste away from landfill play a key role in tackling the environmental impacts of increasing waste volumes.
•As recycling and incineration with energy recovery are increasingly used, net greenhouse gas emissions from municipal waste management are expected to drop considerably by 2020.
•Limiting or avoiding growth in waste volumes would further reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector and deliver other benefits to society and the environment.
Growing waste volumes of Luxembourg 30 cm thick or Malta 2.5 m thick!
These results indicate that efforts to prevent the generation of waste should be significantly reinforced, if the aim of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of a significant reduction in volumes of waste is to be achieved.
While an EU‑15 citizen generated 570 kg on average in 2004, the figure was only 335 kg for an EU‑12 citizen. Nevertheless, as EU‑12 economies further develop and consumption patterns evolve, waste volumes are likely to increase over the next 15 years and approach current EU‑15 levels.
On average, each European citizen generated 460 kg municipal waste in 1995.
This amount rose to 520 kg per person in 2004, and a further increase to 680 kg per person is projected by 2020.
In total, this corresponds to an increase of almost 50 % in 25 years.
This projected continuing increase in waste volumes is primarily due to an assumed sustained growth in private final consumption (i.e. an average growth in the EU‑15 and EU‑12 respectively of 2 % and 4 % per year by 2020 (EC, 2006)) and a continuation of current trends in consumption patterns.
However, as shown in Figure 1, there are significant differences
Historically, disposal by landfilling has been the predominant treatment method for municipal waste, but over the last two decades considerable reductions in landfilling have taken place.
In 2004, 47 % of total EU municipal waste was landfilled
If we were simply to spread all EU municipal waste generated in 2020 (i.e. about 340 million tonnes) on the ground, it would cover an area the size between EU‑15 (
1) Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and

national and European levels to achieve, among other things, the objectives set in the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
An EEA publication (2007) illustrates patterns in Member States approaches to waste management, particularly in the context of the Landfill Directive.
(see Figure 1).
This is expected to decrease further to around 35 % by 2020.
Recycling and other material‑recovery operations are expected to increase from the current level of 36 % to around 42 % by 2020.
Finally incineration was used for 17 % of municipal waste in 2004 and is likely to increase to about 25 % by 2020.
01 improved management capacity does not keep up with the increasing waste quantities, net greenhouse gas emissions can be higher due to inefficient management.
This pushes direct emissions of greenhouse gases from the waste management sector up.
Landfilling represents 60 % of the total in 2020, and recycling and incineration about 20 % each.
Overall, therefore, the projections show that better management of municipal waste will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, decoupling environmental pressures from economic growth as called for in the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
While the projections show that net emissions of greenhouse gases will fall despite increasing volumes of waste, action to limit or avoid the projected growth in waste volumes will further reduce net greenhouse gas emissions from the waste management sector.
The collection and transport of waste, closely linked to waste volumes, is estimated to account for less than 5 % of the direct greenhouse gas
The projections used in this study assume that waste management capacity grows to match demand. However, if investment in new and
On the other hand, recycling and incineration will be increasingly used.
This represents savings (or avoided greenhouse gas emissions) that offset direct emissions.
Recycling contributes 75 % of total avoided emissions by 2020 and incineration almost 25 %.

The cost of collection and treatment of waste is particularly onerous, and generating waste is by definition a loss of resources.

Limiting waste volumes will also deliver other benefits such as reduced costs of waste management, and reduced air pollution (with particles and oxides of nitrogen) and noise related to the collection and transport of waste.
The costs of waste management can
In conclusion, Europe cannot become complacent with regard to the continuing growth in waste — reflecting our current unsustainable consumption and production patterns — as this in the long term may outweigh the improvements taking place in the waste management sector.

4 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / WHAT IS SIGNALS
What is Signals a story-based approach to help us better communicate with this diverse group of people.The eight stories addressed are not exhaustive but have been selected on the basis of their relevance to the current environmental policy debate in Europe.
They address priority issues of climate change, nature and biodiversity, the use of natural resources and health. Signals uses several approaches to tell its stories.
While each story has specific points to make, as a collection, they also illustrate the many inter-relations between seemingly unconnected issues.
We would appreciate your feedback on Signals.
Please submit your comments through the EEA public enquiry form: http://www.eea.europa.eu/enquiries.
Remember to write 'Signals' in the subject field.
Signals is published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) at the start of each year and provides snapshot stories on issues of interest both to the environmental policy debate and the wider public for the upcoming year.We monitor the environment across our 32 member countries in partnership with our network.
From researchers up to their knees in water to satellite imaging from space, we work with a huge amount of environmental data.
Finding, reading and understanding the range of ‘signals’ regarding the health and diversity of our environment is at the heart of what we do.
Signals respects the complexity of the underlying science and shows awareness of the uncertainties inherent in all of the issues we address.Our target audience is broad, ranging from students to scientists, policy-makers to farmers and small business people.
Signals, which will be published in all 26 EEA languages, takes
Editorial but there are environments without societies.
The lack of accounting for what matters in this relationship lies at the heart of the degradation we see all around us in our natural world. In 2006 Lord Nicolas Stern put a price on the impacts of climate change.
He estimated that the cost of climate change impacts could be massively reduced if emissions of greenhouse gases were cut immediately.
Taking action now will be cheaper and more effective than actions later. The Stern analysis has spawned initiatives in other policy areas, most notably biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Initiatives like Stern have helped people to understand what is at stake if we continue our current consumption patterns.
Above all, we need to regain a sense of humility about the natural world because, as indigenous peoples have long understood, we must ultimately answer to nature.
Nature has rules and limits of its own.
Our natural world is the bedrock — not the backdrop — of our society.With Signals, we intend to contribute to this appreciation of the natural environment.
We hope to influence thinking and attitudes and effect the decisions that all of us make every day.
This will be an historic year for the environment culminating in a major UN meeting on climate change in Copenhagen next December.
The meeting, possibly the most important environmental gathering to date, must come up with a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.
Greenhouse gas emissions are just one symptom of a much deeper issue: our inability to live sustainably.
However, the scale of these environmental problems should not paralyse us into inaction.
It should raise our awareness and encourage us to develop new, more sustainable patterns of living, growing, producing and consuming. Ultimately, we are talking about revaluing the fundamental elements of life.
Our natural world often provides a stunning backdrop to our daily lives.
It may be a local stream, pond or stretch of beach.
On a grander scale, we are struck by the beauty of the Alps or the Carpathian mountains, the ancient forests, the great rivers or the stunning coasts.
Beyond Europe, images of the Arctic and Antarctic ice masses, the rainforests of the Amazonia and the safari plains of Africa are imprinted on our minds. Much of our natural heritage is now under threat from unprecedented population growth and economic development.
There were 3 billion people on earth when I was born.
Today there are 6.7 billion of us and we expect the number to rise to 9 billion by 2050.
The world’s economy, in terms of global gross domestic product (GDP), has grown at an unprecedented rate: in 1950 GDP was EUR 4 trillion.
In 2007 it was over EUR 42 trillion.
This ten fold increase has several key drivers, not least the movement of raw materials and goods — which come from our environment.
In contrast to this economic growth, our environment has suffered.
Glaciers are melting in Europe’s mountain ranges with more river flooding expected as a consequence and misery for millions of ordinary people.
Arctic summer sea ice is receding and thinning faster than ever: in 2007 the extent of the sea ice was half that measured in the 1950s.
Around the world, more than a billion, mostly poor, people rely on fisheries for their food and livelihoods.
However, half of all wild fisheries have been fully exploited.
The majority of today’s commercial fisheries are likely to have collapsed by 2050 if current trends are not reversed.
Back on land, rainforests are being decimated for developments that take no account of the many valuable ecological services they provide.
These trends may change our relationship with the natural world but not our reliance on it.
The natural resources provided by the planet underpin our economic activity and the very cohesion of our societies. However, the way we organise our economies does not give sufficient recognition to the dependent nature of this relationship — there are no societies without environments,

Not just hot air
Global diplomacy and the search for a successor to the Kyoto Protocol
Every winter the gates of Copenhagen's famous Tivoli Gardens, an old world amusement park in the city centre, open to officially mark the beginning of the extended Christmas period.
This December the twinkling lights of Tivoli will most likely be outshone by COP 15 — the most important global climate change meeting ever — as thousands of diplomats, politicians, business people, environmentalists and climate experts from around the globe flock to the Danish capital.
EEA SIGNALS 2009 / CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION / 7 nations like China and India, which have rapidly developing economies, have no targets under the protocol.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon
It was here that the global effort to tackle climate change began in earnest. The summit resulted in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which forms the legal basis for global efforts to address climate change.
Meetings of the Convention, known as Conferences of the Parties (COPs), have taken place every year since 1994.
from agriculture are estimated based on the area of cultivated soils, type of crop, use of fertiliser and the number of livestock (cattle, poultry, sheep, pigs, etc.) in the country.
Just as athletes are regularly tested to make sure they stay within the rules, there is regular monitoring.
The data are added together to form an overall picture of emissions across Europe and sent to the European Commission, from where it is passed on as the official submission of the European Community to the UNFCCC.Because data are first verified at a national level there is a one and half year delay.
The latest report released in June 2008 is based on data from 2006.
It shows that emissions from the EU-15 were 3 % below the 'base year'.
What do the numbers mean?
Kyoto — a first step in cutting emissions
The EEA climate change team plays a role in the European effort, coordinating an accountancy job of enormous proportions.
Data from around Europe on emissions of so-called greenhouse gases are collected, verified and then analysed in two key reports that feed into the Kyoto process.
This year, the numbers and the analysis they facilitate, have a particular significance in the context of the COP 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases.
Countries that have not signed up or do not yet have targets will be especially interested in how well the EU is implementing the protocol.
The inventory report — counting gases
The concept of counting gases is quite abstract.
As a result it is also difficult to figure out what a percentage cut or increase in emissions means.
It may help to imagine the cuts as days of the year.
The EU-15 Kyoto target translates into 29 days worth of emissions.For each of the 5 years between 2008–2012, EU-15 emissions should be on average, 29 days less than 1990 levels.
In this way, emission reductions must occur consistently over several years.The latest EEA data show that 10 days worth of emissions were cut between 1990 and 2006.
The EU-15 must cut 19 more days to meet the target.
Trends and projections
The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNFCCC, is a first step in the long-term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change.
The first commitment period of the protocol effectively runs out in 2012 and 'COP 15' will be expected to produce an ambitious successor.Kyoto is significant because it set binding emission targets for the developed countries that ratified it.
For example, the 15 countries who were members of the EU (EU-15) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the Kyoto 'base year' (1).
They must achieve this target during the period 2008–2012 (2).Countries are expected to meet their Kyoto targets mainly by cutting emissions at home.
However a range of other options are available to help them reach their target (see box: Get us to Kyoto on time).'Kyoto' has been quite controversial mainly because the United States did not ratify it and because developing
Immediately after the hand-over of the 'inventory' report, the EEA's climate change team begins its second major reporting exercise of the year culminating in the 'Trends and projections' report.
The report is published in the winter just as the annual UN COP meeting is about to meet.
The first EEA greenhouse gas report comes out each spring and is called the 'inventory' report.
Greenhouse gases in this context refer to a collection of the most serious climate changing gases including: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide as well as fluorinated gases.
The inventory report shows national trends: whether emissions are going up or down. Within each country it shows where the reductions or increases in emissions are coming from.
Each EU Member State must present an estimate of its emissions to the European Commission and the EEA.
Consider the energy sector, which is responsible for more than 80 % of the total greenhouse gases emissions in the EU.
Different gases have different 'base years' under Kyoto. For carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (99 % of all emissions) 1990 is used as the 'base year' for all EU-15 Member States.
For fluorinated gases, countries can choose another year instead.
Twelve EU-15 Member States have chosen 1995. The EU-15 has a joint Kyoto target.
Within this, each EU-15 Member State has a differentiated reduction target: some should reduce emissions while others are allowed a limited increase.
New EU Member States have individual targets except Cyprus and Malta, which have no targets.
8 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION or they will not impact in time to meet the target, the report says.At a national level France, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom had already reached their Kyoto target in 2006.
This report contains a deeper analysis of the emission trends outlined in the first report and pin points where the emissions and emission's reductions came from.
Most importantly, the report looks ahead and evaluates projections of future greenhouse gas emissions as far as 2012 and beyond to 2020.
This future perspective is invaluable in terms of seeing the extent of the problem ahead and developing policy to deal with it (3).The latest Trends and projections report confirms that the EU-15 cut its emissions by 3 % between the 'base year' and 2006.
A combination of approaches will be needed to fill the remaining gap, the report says.
Existing and planned 'domestic' efforts (happening on the ground in each country), Kyoto mechanisms, carbon sinks (such as planting trees to soak up gases) and trading carbon credits will all be used and could result in a potential emissions reduction of 11 % for the EU-15.
Get us to Kyoto on time
Emissions from the EU-15 were 3 % below 'base year' levels in 2006, according to the latest EEA data.
Countries that have signed up to Kyoto must make substantial emissions reductions at home.
However, having satisfied this condition, they can also use Kyoto Mechanisms, such as the 'Clean Development Mechanism' (CDM) and 'Joint Implementation', two schemes that allow a country to offset a share of its own emissions by investing in reduction efforts elsewhere.
The EU 'Emissions Trading Scheme' (EU ETS) is another tool, which helps

– 1 set for all industrial sites that emit a lot

0102030% (relative to base-year emissions)
Following a proposal by the European Commission, the EU ETS could be expanded to include additional sectors, such as aviation, petrochemicals, ammonia and the aluminium sector, as well as new gases, so that approximately half of all EU emissions would be covered (5).
Gap between 2010 projections (existing measures) and Kyoto target
During the Kyoto period (2008–2012) developed countries can also trade emission allowances between themselves in order to meet their national targets.
Looking ahead to 2020, the report gives a long range estimate of the emissions situation in Europe.
This is particularly relevant in the context of the 'Climate and Energy package' being proposed by the European Commission, which is proposing targets for 2020.Compared to the Kyoto 'base year'.Currently emissions from international aviation and shipping are not covered under the Kyoto Protocol or by EU law.The full effect of the EU Emission Trading Scheme is not reflected in all Member States' projections.

The buzz words, 'common but differentiated responsibility', first uttered at the Earth Summit in Rio, have popped up ever since in climate change circles.
In simple language the phrase reflects the fact that developed nations have a greater responsibility for the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.
These countries have been more industrialised, have created more emissions and should have legal targets to cut emissions before developing nations.
It has proved very difficult to turn the concept into action acceptable to both industrialised and developing countries.
Next December, a major task of the COP 15 will be to finally turn the rhetoric into a global emissions reduction effort.
That means new targets for emissions reductions and most importantly the buy-in of America and major developing nations such as India and China.
We already know the EU's position on future emissions reduction efforts: a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020, growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen.
All EU-27 Member States will be included.
The EU's 2020 target is almost equivalent to removing emissions from all transport across Europe.
Imagine every truck, bus car, train boat and aeroplane disappearing — in terms of emissions.
It's ambitious, but it must be because the challenge is serious.
10 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION: WATER AND DROUGHT
Climate change adaptation and water
'Our water is shut off once or twice a month, sometimes more,' says Barış Tekin from his apartment in Beşiktaş, an historic district of Istanbul, where he lives with his wife and daughter.
'We have about 50 litres of bottled water in the apartment for washing and cleaning, just in case.
If the water is off for a really long time we go to my father's place or to my wife's parents,' says Barış, an economics professor at Marmara University.
EEA SIGNALS 2009 / CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION: WATER AND DROUGHT / 11
The old apartment does not have a water tank of its own so the Tekins' are directly connected to the city's water system.
A drought in Western Turkey over the past two years means that water is regularly shut off by the city for periods of up to 36 hours.
Water shortages are not new — Barış remembers them from his childhood.
Although improvements in the infrastructure mean less water wasted, the current drought is particularly serious and 'water rationing' during the summer months is a fact of life for the city's 12 million residents.
Impacts of climate change government has been forced to apply emergency measures which include cutting water supply by 30 %.
In Turkey, water levels fell consistently last summer, according to the state waterworks authority.
The reservoirs supplying drinking water to Istanbul had 28 % of their capacity.
The reservoirs supplying Ankara, home to four million people, had only 1 % of its drinking water capacity. A report from the Water Office for Crete painted an alarming picture of groundwater resources on the island.
Aquifers — underground reservoirs — have dropped by 15 metres since 2005 because of over pumping.
Seawater has actually begun to creep in, polluting the remaining supplies.
Crisis control is not adaptation pollution from storm water overflow and emergency discharges from waste water treatment plants.In the spring of 2008, water levels in the reservoirs supplying Barcelona were so low that plans were made to ship water in.
At an estimated cost of EUR 22 million, six shiploads, each holding enough fresh water to fill ten Olympic swimming pools, were sourced.
The fresh water was to come from Tarragona in southern Catalonia, Marseille and Almeria — one of the driest areas of southern Spain.
Luckily, May was wet, the reservoirs filled sufficiently and the plans were shelved.
However, discussions around diverting water from rivers such as the Ebro and even the Rhône in France continue (1).Cyprus is experiencing a catastrophic drought.
Water demand has been increasing over the past 17 years and
3 is over 100 million cubic metres (m
Over the last three
Current droughts and water crisis must be dealt with in the short term to ensure that people have water.
However, long-term adaptation policies must also be developed.
Governments at local and national level, desperate to boost water supply, are investing in projects such as reservoirs for storing water, water transfer and desalination plants, which make salt water fit for drinking.
Extremes of heat and drought, rain and flooding are affecting many parts of Europe.

Greenhouse gases are causing our climate to change.
Southern Europe is expected to become warmer and drier while the North and North West will most likely become milder and wetter.
Overall global temperatures will continue to rise.
However, even if emissions stop today, climate change will continue for a long time due to the historical build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Impacts are already clear in the Arctic, for example.
We must begin to adapt.
Adaptation means assessing and dealing with the vulnerability of human and natural systems.
EU Member States agree that global temperature increases should be limited to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels in order to avoid severe changes to our climate.
Mitigation efforts are focused on cutting emissions of 'greenhouse' gases.
Limiting temperature increases to 2 °C
Climate change mitigation and adaptation are very closely linked.
The more successful mitigation efforts are in cutting emissions, the less extensive our need for adaptation.
As temperatures rise, southern Europe's reserves of water will drop.
At the same time, agriculture and tourism will require more water especially in the hotter drier regions.An increase in water temperatures and lower river flows in the south will also affect water quality.
On 27 May 2008, the Department of the Environment for the Spanish region of Catalonia said that recent heavy rains have eased the drought in the regional capital of Barcelona, possibly allowing the government to lift restrictions on water use.
Reservoirs that were at 20 % of their capacity in March are now 44 % full.
12 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION: WATER AND DROUGHT management but the process of turning salty water into drinking water is notoriously energy intensive.
Some plants now make use of solar energy, which is a positive step.
However, desalination is still expensive.
Also, the salty brine, a by product of the process is difficult to dispose of and can harm the environment.
Managing our water resources
'It is often over 40 °C here in the summer and the humidity can be very high,' Barış says from Istanbul.
'The local authorities are much better at warning us now and they can usually tell us how long the water will be off — so we can make plans. But, they don't seem to be doing much to deal with the
Mediterranean countries are increasingly relying on desalination to provide fresh water.
Spain currently has 700 desalination plants, which provide enough water for 8 million people every day.
Desalination is expected to double over the next 50 years in Spain.Water shortages are not restricted to Southern Europe.
The United Kingdom is constructing its first desalination plant in east London.
At a cost of GBP 200m, more than EUR 250m, the facility could supply 140 million litres of water a day, enough to supply 400 000 homes.
Ironically, the local water authority constructing the plant loses many millions of litres of clean drinking water everyday, through leaky pipes and poor infrastructure.Desalination can have a legitimate role to play in long term water shortage itself — they can't make it rain more, I suppose,' he said.Regional and national authorities in Turkey, and all over Europe, could better 'manage' water resources.
This means taking action to reduce and manage demand instead of simply trying to increase the supply of water.
The Water Framework Directive (WFD), the defining piece of legislation on water in Europe, obliges Member States to use pricing (charging money) for water-related services as an effective tool for promoting water conservation.
Indeed water pricing is one of the most effective methods of influencing water consumption patterns.
However, effective water management must also include efforts towards reducing water losses and information on waterefficiency.
Better information will help us adapt
Total abstraction per year/long-term renewable resource102030405060
The Water Exploitation Index (WEI) (Figure 1) is a good example of the type of information needed to give an overview of the scale and location of the problems facing us.
In simple terms, the index shows available water resources in a country or region compared to the amount of water used. An index of over 20 % usually indicates water scarcity.
As the graph shows, nine countries are considered 'water stressed': Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, Italy, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Malta, Spain, and the United Kingdom (England and Wales).
WEI data are available for England and show that the South East and London are especially stressed.
This level of information is key in terms of effective adaptation to climate change.
By understanding how much water is available in a region, where it's coming from and who uses it, we will be able to build effective local strategies to adapt to climate change.

Looking ahead shows that 50 % of the Mediterranean coastline is built on.
Water shortages and drought are already an issue in many of these regions.
More apartments, more tourists and more golf courses mean increased demand for water.
Coastal areas in the North and West of Europe, where increased flooding is expected, are also being rapidly developed. The integration of adaptation into key EU policies has been limited.
However, the European Commission is expected to publish a White paper on adaptation in 2009.
A recent EEA report points out that only seven of the 32 EEA countries have actually adopted National Adaptation Strategies for climate change, so far.
However, all EU Member states are busy preparing, developing and implementing national measures based on the observed situation in each country.The joined up thinking necessary for effective adaptation is not well developed but the process is starting.

Adaptation to water shortages in the Alps (in preparation).
An upcoming EEA report considers the Alps, often described as the 'water tower of Europe' because 40 % of Europe's fresh water comes from the mountain range.
The Alpine region has experienced temperature increases of 1.48 °C in the last hundred years — twice the global average.
Glaciers are melting, the snowline is rising and the mountain range is gradually changing the way it collects and stores water in winter and distributes it again in the warmer summer months, the report says. The Alps are crucial in terms of water supply, not only to the eight alpine countries, but to a huge part of continental Europe, feeding many of the major rivers.
As such they act as an iconic symbol of the scale of the threat and the type of response required.
Adaptation strategies and policies must include local, cross border, and EU-wide elements.
Seemingly unconnected activities, such as farming and tourism, energy production and public health must be considered together. Ultimately, adaptation means reconsidering where and how we live now and in the future.

14 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / BIODIVERSITY: INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES
Killer slugs and other aliens
Is gardening one of your interests?
If so and you live in central or northern Europe, the 'killer slug' is probably one of your personal enemies.
The slug, which attacks your herbs and vegetables relentlessly, seems immune to control measures.
EEA SIGNALS 2009 / BIODIVERSITY: INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES / 15
The killer slug, known scientifically as Arion lusitanicus, is also called the 'Spanish slug' because it is native to the Iberian peninsula.
The slug is hermaphrodite and can spread very quickly.
More aggressive than the native black slug it eats weaker slugs.
The killer slug started to spread around Europe about 30 years ago, travelling as eggs in the soil of potted plants.
This route is still a major source of infestation today.The slug is just one example of a much wider threat to Europe's biodiversity as alien or non-native species establish and spread across the continent as a result of human activities.
Most arrive as stowaways and are transported unwittingly around the globe.
The UN Convention on Biological Diversity identifies the threat of invasive alien species as one of the major threats to biodiversity worldwide.Alien species have been arriving in new places as long as people have been travelling and trading.
Increased
Invasive alien species often exact a high financial cost from their new homes.
Alien weeds reduce European agricultural yields and Dutch elm disease — caused by an introduced fungus — has devastated elm trees in the forests of central Europe.
The American grey squirrel, introduced to the United Kingdom, not only out-competes the native red squirrel — an impact hard to value in monetary terms — but damages coniferous trees and reduces their value as timber.The cost in terms of damage and control of invasive alien species in the United States has been estimated at EUR 80 billion each year.
Initial estimates put the cost in Europe at more than EUR 10 billion per year.
This is without considering the cost of major human pathogens (such as HIV or influenza) or exceptional outbreaks of animal diseases.
Management actions to reduce (or exterminate) established invasive alien species are difficult, cumbersome and trade, exploration and colonisation from the 1600s started the invasion proper with notable species such as brown rats arriving for the first time on ships from Asia.
About 10 000 alien species have been registered in Europe.
Some, such as the potato and the tomato, were introduced on purpose and remain economically important to this day.
Others, called 'invasive alien species' create serious problems as pest species to gardening, agriculture, forestry as vectors of diseases or by damaging constructions such as buildings and dams.
Invasive alien species also change the ecosystems they live in and impact on the other species in those ecosystems.
Biodiversity — the wider context ecosystems and existing native plant and animal species. The problem of invasive species is expected to worsen in the coming century through climate change, increasing trade and tourism.
Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on earth.
It represents the planet's natural wealth and as such provides the basis for our lives and prosperity.
It supports many basic services that we depend on such as the water we drink and the air we breathe.
It helps to pollinate crops, put food on the table, regulate weather patterns and clean up our waste.
Currently, biodiversity is vanishing at an alarming rate mainly because of how we misuse nature to sustain production, consumption and trade in the globalized economy we live in.
Habitat loss and fragmentation caused by clearing forests and natural areas for housing, roads and agriculture, the draining of wetlands and damning of rivers for agriculture, and clearing the seas of fish, is the primary cause of biodiversity loss.
The other main threats to biodiversity come from pollution, climate change and over-exploitation of resources.
As the world's population is forecast to grow from 6.7 billion people today to nine billion in 2050, it is expected that the impacts on biodiversity from the current main threats will grow and losses increase.
Without biodiversity we would not be able to survive. As such it can be seen as an insurance policy provided to us by the planet.
Its value can be compared with financial markets, where a diverse portfolio of species stocks, as with business stocks, can provide a buffer against disturbances.
Invasive alien species are considered by many conservationists to be the second greatest threat to biodiversity worldwide.
Whether introduced deliberately or accidentally, such species can cause havoc to people,
The European Commission supports nature management projects in the Member States through the EU LIFE Regulation. The LIFE funds are increasingly being used for projects on invasive alien species and the budget is now approaching EUR 14 million per 3-year period.
IAS and Europe — increasing impacts contact can result in strong dermatitis.
Today, the giant hogweed is most likely beyond eradication in Europe while early actions (up to the 1950s) probably would have had better prospects.
In line with this, the European Commission in the recent communication on biodiversity underlined the need for an 'early warning' mechanism for invasive alien species.
In response, the EEA with its network of member and collaborating countries, is planning to establish a European-wide information system that will identify, detect, assess and respond to new and expanding invasions.
The most-wanted list
Alien species come in all shapes and sizes.
Some are deliberately introduced and economically important, others have little impact but quite a few have been a disaster.
As a result, a first step in developing control and management measures, is to identify the most offensive species so that efforts are directed towards these.
In order to get better understanding of the invasive alien species and their impact on European biodiversity the EEA, supported by a number of experts, has established a list of the worst invasive alien species threatening biodiversity in Europe.
The list currently contains 163 species or species groups.
Species are added to the list if they are very widespread and/or if they create significant problems for biodiversity and ecosystems in their new habitats.Species on the list, of which vascular plants are the most common with 39 entries, have a significant impact on native biodiversity at the genetic, species or ecosystem levels.
Many also affect human health and the economy.
Since 1950, on average more than one of the listed species establishes itself each year and there is no clear sign that the situation is improving (Figure 1).
Alien species can be found in all European ecosystems.
Globalisation, particularly increased trade and tourism, have resulted in an upsurge in the number and type of alien species arriving in Europe.Marine and coastal areas are being drastically affected as a result of increased shipping and the building of canals between isolated seas — the Suez canal is still a major source of new species entering the Mediterranean Sea.
Released ballast water from ships is such a big source of new organisms that the 'International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water & Sediments' has been established to 'prevent, minimize and ultimately eliminate the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens' in this manner. Cumulative number of species
Control measures
The most efficient defence against invasive alien species is prevention — basically a border patrol blocking new species.
A second step is early detection and control.
A striking example is the giant hogweed, Heracleum mantegazzianum, introduced to Europe as an ornamental plant in the 19th century.
The plant is now subject to considerable local control efforts as the species has established in grasslands, along railways, roadsides and along river banks.
Forming dense stands the hogweed crowds native plants out.
It is also poisonous and direct skin

Actions necessary to counter invasive alien species include measures for management and restoration which are usually both difficult and costly.
For example, control measures against the killer slug have been cumbersome and often have only a local and temporary effect.
The EU also finances studies of these species within the 'programme for research and technological development'.The problem of invasive alien species is not going away.
Globalisation and climate change (species moving because of changes to the natural habitat) means that more and more of us will come into contact with these species.
Increasing public and political awareness is thus needed to put resources to controlling the main pathways of introduction, monitoring of risk areas for early detection and being prepared for immediate action to eradicate undesirable species.

Air quality in Europe
* The characters in this story are fictional.
However the data are real.
The story is set on 27 July 2008 when an air quality warning was issued in Brussels people's health or the environment has still not been reached.
EEA analysis suggests that 15 of the 27 EU Member States will miss one or more of their legally binding 2010 targets to reduce harmful air pollutants.
Particulate matter and ozone
Two pollutants, fine particulate matter and ground-level ozone, are now generally recognised as the most significant in terms of health impacts.
Long-term and peak exposure can lead to a variety of health effects, ranging from minor irritation of the respiratory system to premature death.
Particulate matter, a term used to describe a variety of tiny particles from sources such as vehicle exhausts and domestic stoves, affects the lungs.
Exposure can harm people of all ages, but people with existing heart and respiratory problems are particularly at risk. According to the latest EEA data, since 1997 up to 50 % of Europe's urban population may have been exposed to concentrations of particulate matter above the EU limit set to protect human health.
As much as 61 % of the urban population may have been exposed to levels of ozone that exceed the EU target.
Anna is 37 years old and lives in the centre of Brussels.
She and her young son Johan are planning a trip outside the busy city.
Anna suffers from asthma and her doctor has warned of the dangers of air pollution, especially on hot summer days.Anna has heard about the London fogs of the 1950s that killed 2 000 people in one week.
She has childhood memories of evening news bulletins showing dead fish and dying trees as 'acid rain' first came to popular attention in the 1970s.
Motherhood and a recent asthma attack have quite rightly brought air pollution back to mind.
The fact is that emissions of many air pollutants have fallen substantially across Europe since Anna's childhood.
The air she and Johan breathe is much improved compared to the past, and air policy is one of the great success stories of the EU's environmental efforts.
In particular, EU policy has dramatically cut emissions of sulphur, the main component of 'acid rain'.
In contrast, nitrogen — also a major component of 'acid rain' — has not been dealt with to the same extent and so continues to cause major problems.
A significant proportion of Europe's urban population still live in cities where EU air quality limits, protecting human health, are regularly exceeded.
Each year, many more people die prematurely from air pollution in Europe than die in traffic accidents.
Nitrogen But what's that smell?
A tractor is spraying liquid manure onto a field not far away.
This is irritating, Anna thinks, but it's also part of real country life which is shown in a rather more romantic way in Johan's picture books.
The pungent smell is caused by as many as 40 different chemical substances emitted from the manure.
), a volatile nitrogen compound, is one of them.
(NH3 is caustic and can damage very high concentrations NH3
A day in the country the respiratory tract.
However, the levels here are not dangerous for human health.
Anna can breathe a sigh of relief, albeit a stinky one.
Anna is planning a day in the country with Johan.
Using maps, Anna can scan readings and forecasts for particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide among many others. The data are relayed to the web from monitoring stations around the country.
Improvements in monitoring and availability of information on air pollution are another of the success stories of recent years. For instance, local data on ozone levels are now passed onto the EEA 'Ozone web' (1) service that provides an overview
Ozone incident in Brussels 27 July 2008
Very high
Slight
Low
The reading, taken minutes earlier, shows high levels of ozone in Brussels.
Indeed the website forecasts that levels will exceed EU target values later that day and again the following day (Figure 1).
Anna leaves her apartment building and makes for the nearest Metro station, a 10 minute walk away.
Out on the street, the full impact of the city's traffic problems are easy to see — and smell.
Exhaust emissions from cars in the centre of Brussels, and all major cities, irritate the respiratory tract and eyes and lungs.
Anna and Johan turn into their local train station and head for the countryside.Soon, Anna and Johan are entering a national park just outside Brussels.
A sign tells them that they are visiting a Natura 2000 site — one part of a European-wide ecological network, set up to secure natural habitats and to maintain the range of plant and animal life.
A similar service, providing local information on particulate matter levels across Europe is being developed.
Looking ahead Because air pollution pays no regard to national boundaries the problem needs to be tackled internationally.
The United Nations Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention) agreed in 1979, has been signed by 51 countries and forms the basis of the international fight to tackle air pollution.
In parallel, the EU has developed polices limiting the total emissions of each Member State, setting legally binding limits.
The 'National Emissions Ceiling Directive' (NECD) is a key EU policy.
It sets 'ceilings' or limits for
Nitrogen is an essential nutrient in nature.
Reactive nitrogen forms are actually used by our bodies to produce proteins.
However, excess nitrogen can lead to severe environmental and health problems.
'Acid rain' forms when high levels of sulphur and nitrogen oxides are present in the air.
One of the great success stories of air pollution policy over the last decades has been the massive reduction in emissions of sulphur dioxide.
The 32 EEA member countries reduced sulphur emissions by 70 % between 1990 and 2006.
Nitrogen, on the other hand, has not been dealt with as successfully.
With sulphur emissions declining, nitrogen is now the principal acidifying component in our air.
Agriculture and transport are the main sources of nitrogen pollution.
Agriculture is responsible for more than 90 % of ammonia (NH
Suddenly Johan, who has been walking unsteadily loses his balance and falls into a clump of stinging nettles.
Having picked him up and brushed him off, Anna notices nettles everywhere.
She has vivid memories of them as a child in a neighbour's garden.
Then the nettles grew around a compost heap that was also used as a dump for poultry dung.
It occurs when too many chemical nutrients (such as N) are available to an ecosystem either on land or in water.
In water, excessive plant growth and subsequent decay occur, which in turn leads to further effects including oxygen depletion.
Fish and other animals and plants ultimately suffocate as the oxygen supply is used up.The abundance of the nettles here suggests that despite being a protected habitat, the Natura 2000 site is not immune from airborne nitrogen deposits.
The fence protecting the area offers no defence — in fact building a greenhouse around the area would be the only way to protect it totally from airborne substances.
Climate change mitigation efforts will improve air quality
In January 2008, the European Commission proposed a Climate and Energy package to:
It has been estimated that the above package will cut the cost of meeting EU air pollution targets by EUR 8.5 billion per year.
The savings to the European health services could be as much as six times that figure.
The efforts required to meet these targets will also cut air pollution in Europe.
For example, improvements in energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy will both lead to reduced amounts of fossil fuel combustion — a key source of air pollution.
These positive side effects are referred to as the 'co-benefits' of climate change policy.
• reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020;• increase the share of renewable energy by 20 % by 2020;• improve energy efficiency by 20 % by 2020.

Taking CAP in hand
Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy
A shrinking resource Almost 80 % of Europeans live in big cities, towns or the urban settlements between the two, far removed from the realities of agriculture.
Our rural landscape nevertheless has a huge significance in terms of providing food, raw materials, fuel and recreational opportunities.
EEA SIGNALS 2009 / AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT / 23
The CAP in context
The CAP was introduced in 1962 and consumes 40 % of the entire EU budget.
In 2007 this translated into over EUR 54 billion.
Agriculture contributes to 1.2 % of EU GDP and 4.7 % of all jobs in the EU (1).
The CAP currently has two 'pillars': production and there is a stronger focus on rural development and environmental objectives.
CAP is currently undergoing a 'health check' by the European Commission, the European Parliament and Members States.
In the context of the discussions on the future of the policy, the EEA is also preparing an analysis of the CAP focusing on 'targeting' of the subsidy's 'environmental' spending.
Where is the money going and what effect is it having?
What follows is a preview of some of our findings.
• Pillar I provides direct aid and market interventions to secure food production and farmers' income, and making European agriculture more competitive.
It is the dominant part of the budget, responsible for 77.5 % of the total CAP expenditure in 2006.
• Pillar II recognises the central role of farming as a supplier of food and goods, as the cornerstone of rural societies and as a potential environmental manager.
The measures, implemented through Rural Development programmes, are aimed at restructuring the agriculture sector and encouraging environmental protection, diversification and innovation in rural areas.
Farmers manage half of the EU's land area and have a huge impact on Europe's soil, water and biodiversity.
Recent analysis shows that agriculture uses half of the water available in southern Europe.
In the EU-15, farming causes almost half of the nitrogen pollution in rivers, 94 % of ammonia emissions and 9 % of total greenhouse gas emissions.
However, traditional agricultural practices have shaped our landscape and influenced the animals and plants living there.
Many of our rarest species are actually dependent on the continuation of traditional farming practices.
High nature value (HNV) farmland is land that is particularly rich in habitats and species of conservation concern.
It is often associated with traditional or low intensity agriculture, which is not very economical.
Most farmers have intensified production or abandoned farming altogether — trends that threaten natural habitats.An important agriculture policy challenge is to provide economic incentives to farmers for a continuation of wildlife friendly farming practices.
The Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) has undergone a series of fundamental reforms since its birth in an era of post-war food shortages.
The subsidy has increasingly been decoupled from its original goal of increasing food
The EEA has analysed the current expenditure pattern to check how the CAP may contribute to maintenance of HNV farmland.
Current data show the allocation of CAP funding at a national level.
Information within countries is much less detailed.
As a result the EEA has supported case studies in the Netherlands, Estonia, France, Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail.
Pillar II is dedicated to the development of rural areas and also funds environmental management schemes.
Data for EU-25, 2006.
European Commission, 2007b.
24 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT
Countries with a high share of HNV farmland receive comparatively little under Pillar I of the CAP budget (Figure 1).
This is not surprising given that this pillar was originally production-related and is most common in areas of intensive farming.
Pillar II (rural development) expenditure per hectare generally increases with HNV farmland share.
However, spending on agri-environment schemes — the element most related to conservation — is not strongly connected to the amount of HNV farmland in the areas studied (Figure 2).
It should also be noted that this intervention accounts for less than 5 % of total CAP payments.

If farm support and share of HNV farmland were correlated most Member States would be found in the top right and bottom left box.
The fairly even distribution of Member States between all boxes shows that CAP support under the first pillar and for agri-environment schemes is currently not correlated with estimated share of HNV farmland when analysed at Member State level.
Hiding in the tall grass
Black-tailed godwits are tall, long-beaked wading birds found along Europe's shoreline and in wet meadows.
In 1975 there were 120 000 breeding pairs in the Netherlands.
Today there are about 38 000.
Numbers of breeding pairs are dropping across Europe.
However, these measures are not sufficient to stabilise the godwit population. To increase survival sufficiently, payments for late mowing must become part of a comprehensive package that includes greater vegetation, lower nitrogen inputs and controlled water tables.
Conclusions from this example could be applied to the entire CAP budget in terms of its environmental improvement efforts: the CAP is having an effect but it's not effective enough.
However, this 'package' of measures would be very expensive.
Instead, the case study for the Netherlands, part of a forthcoming EEA report, concludes that agri-environment payments should be targeted at a limited number of pasture areas where godwit numbers are still high and predators are limited.
In these areas a combination of measures should be taken such as late and irregular mowing, low nutrient inputs and maintenance of high water tables.
Godwit chicks must eat about 20 000 insects in the first week of their life if they are to survive.
Scientists agree that earlier mowing practices by farmers are at the root of the godwit population decline.
The first grass cutting in the Netherlands happens three weeks earlier then 40 years ago, probably due to improved fertilisation.
Insect populations are much higher in tall grasses and increase even further in grasslands that have not been heavily fertilised.
In short grass, parent birds simply cannot find enough insects to feed their chicks in those crucial first days.
Predators have also become a larger threat because chicks are easy prey in the open short cut grasslands.
In 2006 EUR 1.2 billion of the CAP budget was allocated for the Netherlands, some of which was used to encourage later grass-cutting.
Studies have shown that the survival rate of godwits chicks doubles on pastures benefiting from the late cutting.
This in a nutshell sums up the challenge facing CAP where targeting of funds and design of policy at a local level is crucial.
In 2006, EUR 1.2 billion was spent under Pillar I in the Netherlands; EUR 83.2 million was spent under Pillar II.
The single farm payments, under Pillar I, are still very much targeted at farms with a high productivity because current support payments are linked to the historic distribution of subsidies.

Consequences for biodiversity Ultimately, the effect of the CAP payments on maintenance of HNV farmland is what counts in this analysis.
The available information does not support a clear answer due to a lack of spatial detail.
In addition, the interactions between types and intensity of farming and the nature value of farmland are complex and do differ from region to region.HNV farms are more dependent on CAP funding for their income than intensive farms, which do not support biodiversity.
The EEA case studies confirm that the majority of Pillar I subsidies are targeted to the most productive areas.
Biodiversity is low here and the subsidy provides little incentive to environment-friendly production.
Assessing whether the subsidies are adequate to prevent both land abandonment on the one hand and intensification on the other, however, would need further study.
The evidence regarding the implementation of agri-environment schemes suggests that their effectiveness could be improved.
Some of the measures are promising whilst others show little effect.
In addition, depopulation of the countryside and changing lifestyles may be posing overarching threats to traditional farming systems that in the long run cannot be solved through subsidies.
Looking ahead
Funding for the CAP will be part of a major review of the entire EU budget in 2009–2010.
Reconciling the different functions of the CAP (securing food production, supporting farm incomes, protecting the environment and improving quality of life in rural areas) and making sure that EU taxpayers' money is spent efficiently is challenging.
The limited information available suggests that the current distribution of CAP funds is not very effective from the perspective of achieving EU environmental objectives, in particular on nature protection.
One further result of the EEA analysis is that the available statistical information on CAP spending patterns is still not sufficient to properly evaluate the effects of this important policy.
In simple terms, even though we spend almost half the EU's budget on the CAP, we do not have enough information to say exactly where the money is going or exactly what it is achieving.Pillar I support, although now partially decoupled from production, does little to enhance the biodiversity found on farm land.
Enhancing Pillar II and targeting measures at high nature value farmland is a valid option, but requires careful design and evaluation to prevent unintended negative impacts.
Fish out of water
Marine management in a changing climate
A fisherman's tale On the night of 6 October 1986 lobster fishermen from the small town of Gilleleje, north of Copenhagen, fishing the Kattegat Sea, found their nets crammed with Norway lobster.
Many of the animals were dead or dying.
About half were a strange colour.
If left alone for two years, the cod population in the Baltic would recover
Henrik Sparholt, ICES Advisory Programme Professional Officer
The scale and rapidity of the collapse of cod stocks in the Baltic has meant that a lot of energy has gone into understanding what caused the boom and subsequent collapse.
The region has become an international case study with lessons for other regions.
The Baltic story is not a simple one — indeed the complexity of the situation illustrates the challenge facing policy makers in the marine environment.
Fishing for data
Observations of dissolved oxygen in the water in combination with the dead lobsters told researchers at the National Environmental Research Institute in Denmark that an unusually large area on the bottom of the southern Kattegat was devoid of oxygen.
The strange events were caused by 'anoxia' or lack of oxygen on the sea bed that night.
Collapse of the Bornholm fisheries fish that are available, the more eggs that are spawned.
Following the scientific advice, decisions on total allowable catches (TACs) are made by EU Member States.
These decisions often reflect priorities other than the protection of stocks.
In 2006, approximately 45 % of the assessed fish stocks in Europe's Seas were fished outside safe biological limits.
These fishing levels were agreed at the ministerial level.
Fish breathe oxygen dissolved in water
In particular, the number of fish of a certain age in an area is important. The more young fish that survive in a year, the more fish can be expected to be caught two to five years later when the fish are mature.
Particularly since the 1960s increased use of artificial fertilizers in agriculture as well as urbanization has led to a dramatic rise in nutrient inputs — pollution — into the Baltic Sea.
For centuries the abundance of fish was the cornerstone of the local economy.
In the 1970s about half of the fisheries income came from cod.
By the end of the 1980s cod fisheries had increased to 80 % of the total value.
Many fishermen imagined a bright future and invested in new vessels.
However, by 1990 the catch was on a steep decline.
This collapse put huge financial pressure on the local community.
The reduced salinity has also led to reduced abundance of copepods, a staple food for larvae.
Cod in the Baltic (1 000 tonnes cod)
When water near the seabed becomes anoxic, hydrogen sulphide is released from the sea floor into the water.
Hydrogen sulphide is toxic to most life forms, and it was probably a combination of hydrogen sulphide and lack of oxygen that killed the Norway lobsters in the Kattegat that night back in 1986.
The anoxic areas in the Baltic Sea are now so large that they have led to a reduction in the size of potential spawning areas in the Central Eastern Baltic.
This reduces the spawning success of cod.
Why were the early 1980s such good years for cod fisheries?
ICES advice
Catch
In almost every year when the cod stock has been assessed, the TAC has been set higher than the recommended level.
The TAC exceeds the recommended level by more than 100 % in some of the most recent years.
Interestingly, the actual catch is commonly higher that the TAC because estimated illegal fisheries are also included in the figures.
Source: EEA, 2008.
The high survival rate of cod eggs and larvae from 1978–1983 is explained by four factors.
The primary explanation is that fishing pressure was reduced in the late 1970s.
Secondly, climatic conditions brought inflows of high salinity water from the North Sea.
The Baltic was actually a freshwater lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago, allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake.
28 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / MARINE will contribute to the wider geographic spread of anoxia.
Salinity in the Baltic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Baltic Sea.
Projections for the future ocean climate of the Baltic are for continuing increases in rainfall and decreases in inflows from the North Sea.
This means that stocks of cod and other marine fish are likely to decline further unless fishing pressure is reduced.
Illegal fishing adds to the problem.
It has been estimated that an additional 30 % is landed illegally in this part of the Baltic Sea.
In the summer of 2007 the illegal landings by the Polish fishing fleet were so extensive that Polish fisheries were stopped by the European Commission in the second half of 2007.
And then climate change!
In response to the complex and severe environmental problems in the Baltic Sea, the countries in the region have agreed a 'Baltic Sea Action Plan' to develop national actions towards integrating agricultural, fisheries and regional policies. This plan, adopted in
Climate change is affecting both the temperature and the salt balance of the Baltic.
Both factors are driven by climate.
Quite a small reduction in the salinity is already tipping the balance and changing the composition of the Baltic habitat.
Of the three major fished species, cod, herring, and sprat, cod is particularly sensitive to reduced salinity because salinity affects both their reproductive capacity and the availability of the preferred food for cod larvae.

When this reaction occurs, oxygen concentrations are considered negative) in Autumn 2007.
Over time, there has been a steady increase in the area affected by hydrogen sulphide in the East and West Gotland Basins, and the outer Gulf of Finland.
Water from the Gulf of Finland does not enter into the Gulf of Bothnia.
As a result, despite its depth, it remains well oxygenated, even during autumn.
Climate change will alter the Baltic Sea and its ability to support exploitable cod populations.
Management will need to accommodate these changes if the stock is to stay at a commercially relevant level Professor Brian MacKenzie, DTU-Aqua, Technical University of Denmark
November 2007, is an important basis for more effective implementation of EU policy in the area.
This includes the new Marine Strategy Framework Directive, according to which bordering countries should achieve a 'good environmental status' of the Baltic Sea by 2020, including a requirement that fish communities are brought back to 'a good state'.
In addition, the European Commission is developing a Baltic Sea Regional strategy which will lead to an action plan defining the key players, the financial instruments to be deployed, as well as a work schedule.
This strategy's adoption by Member States will constitute one of the priorities of the Swedish EU Presidency, in the second half of 2009.
Sweden has identified the Baltic Sea environment as one of its top priorities.
The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)was designed to regulate fishing activities from an environmental, economic and social point of view.
However, many of the most commercially valuable fish species in Europe have been heavily over fished and their populations are now below safe biological numbers.
The nature of the legislation makes it costly and difficult to successfully prosecute Member States who over-fish.The obvious lack of success in sustainable management of many of its fish stocks has led marine experts to call for major revisions to the policy, which is clearly the product of compromise between countries.
The marine environment should be treated as an ecosystem rather than as sectors to be exploited.The EU Commissioner for Fisheries and Marine Affairs, Joe Borg has even said that the CFP 'does not encourage responsibility by fishermen or politicians' and launched an immediate review of the policy in September 2008, four years ahead of schedule.
If bioenergy goes boom
The switch from oil to bioenergy is not risk free
Bioenergy is not new.
For millennia, people have been burning wood.
The industrial revolution in the mid-1800s brought so called 'fossil fuels', mainly coal and oil, to the fore.
However, fossil fuels are becoming more difficult to find and extract, more expensive, and subject to intense political debate.
EEA SIGNALS 2009 / ENERGY: BIOENERGY AND LAND-USE CHANGE / 31
Biomass: refers to living and recently dead biological matter.
This can be from crops, trees, algae, agricultural, forest residues or waste streams.
Bioenergy: all types of energy derived from biomass, including biofuels.
Biofuel: liquid transport fuels made from
Bioenergy is on the verge of becoming big business.
It is already the dominant renewable energy source (1) in Europe and its production is likely to increase greatly in the coming decades.
Biofuels have been hailed as a good way of greening transport and avoiding expensive oil imports.The subject of biofuels made world headlines for negative reasons in 2008, mainly in association with rising food prices.
The EEA's work on biofuels is restricted to the environmental pros and cons.
Even here, there is controversy.
A move towards large scale bioenergy production bears considerable environmental risks, mainly in terms of land-use change.
Soils and plants are damage our soil and water resources.
Knock-on effects, so-called 'indirect land-use changes', would impact elsewhere in the world: as Europe cuts back on food exports, other areas of the world would increase food production to fill the gap.
Impacts on global food prices could be significant.
However, risks within Europe could be lessened with the right choice of crops and management.
Biofuels made from waste, from crop or forestry residues for example, do offer environmental advantages.
In this context, the EEA has been looking at how the impending bioenergy boom might develop, and considering whether it can provide the energy we need without damaging the environment.
the two largest stores of COst
Rushing to renewables containing twice as much carbon as our atmosphere.
Converting forest, peat or grasslands en masse to biofuel crops would release more COst than it
The European Commission has proposed a mandatory target: 20 % of all European energy should come from renewables (that's all renewable sources: wind, solar, wave, etc. as well as bioenergy) by 2020.
At the moment, renewables account for 6.7 % of European energy consumption.
Two thirds of this comes from biomass.The European Commission is also keen to promote biofuels — fuel for transport — as diversification is particularly important in transport because of its dependence on oil.
The transport sector is also increasing greenhouse gas emissions and eating up emissions savings achieved by other sectors. The Commission has therefore proposed that biofuels make up 10 % of road transport fuel by 2020, providing they can be certified as sustainable.
Renewable energy includes energy derived from wind, sea, sun, hydropower, etc.The term biofuel can be used for all fuels (solid, liquid or gas) for any purpose derived from biomass.
However, in the context of this analysis it refers specifically to fuels for transport.
32 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / ENERGY: BIOENERGY AND LAND-USE CHANGE is leading to an expansion of world cropland at the expense of natural grasslands and tropical rainforest.
This is important because deforestation and farming practices are currently responsible for an estimated 20 % of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Large scale conversion of forests to cropland increases this share and has serious impacts on biodiversity.Wildlife, and water quantity and quality could also suffer if large areas are converted from natural habitats or traditionally farmed areas, and brought into intensive production for bioenergy.
Visible impacts from 2007 show that biofuel makes up 2.6 % of road transport fuel in the EU.To achieve 10 %, the European Union must increase production and imports of biofuel at a time when biofuels are at the centre of complex ecological and economic debates.
The EU biofuel target is surrounded by more and more debate.
The European Parliament has recently called for a guarantee that 40 % of the 10 % target will come from sources that do not compete with food production.
The EEA's own Scientific Committee has warned that increasing the share of biofuels used in transport to 10 % by 2020 is overambitious and should be suspended.
Global impacts — food prices and land-use change
Promoting biofuels and other bioenergy in Europe inevitably triggers direct and indirect effects elsewhere.
For example, in Europe we could produce biodiesel from rapeseed oil in a sustainable manner, but less rapeseed oil would be available for food production inside and outside Europe.
The gap is likely to be filled in part by palm oil.
However, this would result in the loss of rainforest, as trees in countries such as Indonesia are felled to facilitate the extra palm crops.Worldwide, biofuel demand is one of many factors contributing to the recent rise in food prices, along with droughts in key producer countries, increasing meat consumption and rising oil prices, etc.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that current and proposed biofuel support measures in the EU and US increase average wheat, maize and vegetable oil prices by about 8 %, 10 % and 33 %, respectively, in the medium term.Increasing world food consumption, and the additional demand for biofuel,

ENVIRONMENT do away with this storage function.
It would take decades for the benefits to outweigh the negatives.The impacts on biodiversity and natural resources such as water are more difficult to measure.
Increased corn production in the mid-West United States, for example, threatens marine life in the Gulf of Mexico, where a dead zone more than 20 000 km2 has been created by the high nutrient inputs from the Mississippi.
According to one recent study, meeting the 2022 targets in the US energy bill will increase nitrogen loads in the Mississippi by 10–34 %.
Modelling the future
In 2006 an EEA study estimated that 15 % of projected European energy demand in 2030 could be met with bioenergy derived from agricultural, forestry and waste products, using only European resources.
The study imposed a set of
To avoid the negative impacts of a switch to bioenergy described above, we need strong policies at international level to prevent land-use changes adding to environmental problems in the pursuit of bioenergy.
The challenge is clearly global, and we need a global debate on how to halt loss of biodiversity and address climate change at the same time, while taking into account the global need for increased food production and the daunting price increase in oil.EEA researchers believe that Europe should actively seek to generate as much bioenergy as possible domestically whilst sustaining a balance between food, fuel and fibre production, and without compromising ecosystem services.
We should move on from biofuels, and begin serious research and development of advanced biofuels (see box).
And let's do it in a way that considers all the environmental impacts, including effects on soil, water and biodiversity as well as greenhouse gas emissions.
In this way the EU can take the lead in building a truly sustainable bioenergy sector.
How much bioenergy can Europe produce without harming the environment.
EEA Report No 7/2006.
Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation, Paris.
Second generation biofuels can lead to more substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions and can reduce other adverse effects such as fertiliser use but it is unlikely that they will be available in time to make a substantial contribution to the target of 10 % transport biofuels by 2020.
A lot more research is needed on these production processes and their impacts and opportunities.
Moreover, competition for land and water between dedicated energy crops and food crops will likely remain.
designed to study renewable electricity markets, to analyse how to use this environmentally compatible 'biomass potential' in the most cost-effective way from an environmental point of view.The study suggests that the most cost-effective way of using the 'modelled' biomass potential would be to supply 18 % of Europe's heat, 12.5 % of its electricity and 5.4 % of its transport fuel from biomass by 2030.By decreasing fossil fuel use in all three sectors, this could cut 394 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020.
Even greater emissions reductions would be achieved if policies were put in place to prioritise the use of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) technology in electricity and heat generation.
This process harnesses the heat that is a by-product of energy production.
There are costs, of course.
Enhancing bioenergy use is around 20 % more expensive than a similar model of conventional energy by 2030.
Ultimately, consumers would bear this cost. Developments since this work was started, especially increases in global food prices, indicate that the 'biomass potential' estimates are on the high side: less land is likely to be available in Europe for growing bioenergy crops.
Also, high oil prices could also affect the results.
However, a clear message still emerges from the exercise: it would be better, in terms of costs and climate mitigation, to prioritise bioenergy for electricity and heat generation using CHP plants rather than focus on fuel for transport.
34 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / WASTE SHIPMENTS
Not in my back yard
International shipments of waste and the environment
Waste without borders
Zhang Guofu, 35, makes EUR 700 a month, a huge wage in provincial China, sifting through waste that includes shopping bags from a British supermarket chain and English-language DVDs.
The truth is that waste placed in a bin in London, can quite easily end up 5 000 miles away in a recycling factory in China's Pearl River delta.
EEA SIGNALS 2009 / WASTE SHIPMENTS / 35 disposal from EU Member States nearly quadrupled between 1997 to 2005, this aim has yet to be fulfilled.
The factors driving the export and import of waste vary: availability of special treatment technology; a shortage of materials; differences in prices for disposal or recovery.
EU policy, setting targets for recycling, also leads to waste shipments from Member States who cannot meet their targets at home.
The volumes of waste on the market keep costs low for a country like China, which needs cheap raw materials.
As long as this waste is not for disposal at its destination and does not contain hazardous materials, it is deemed to be an acceptable trade.

contamination of food, soil, and surface water.We do not have a clear picture when it comes to waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) shipped within and out of the EU partly because ambiguous codes are used for the reporting of shipments of electronic waste.
It is difficult to tell if a television is being exported as a second hand device, which is acceptable or as waste for disposal, which is not.
In general, export of WEEE from the EU to non-OECD countries is prohibited.
However, the export of a TV that still works is perfectly acceptable.
Indeed, it appears that a significant portion of the exported used television sets, computers, monitors and telephones to non-OECD countries are waste purchased with the intentions of retrieving the components and elements mentioned above.If the EU cannot sufficiently enforce its own prohibition on exporting WEEE to non-OECD countries, this could seriously undermine the ratification of the ban at the global level under the Basel Convention.
Tracking down good data on electric and electronic waste
Europe has a body of legislation in place regarding the shipment of hazardous and problematic waste.
However, further evidence is required as to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of easing pressure on the environment.Electronic waste, which is considered hazardous, is an important case.
In Africa and Asia it is often dismantled with little or no personal protection equipment or pollution control measures.
Components are often burnt in the open to retrieve metals and fly ash particulates laden with heavy metals and other toxic materials are usually emitted, resulting in increased human exposure, as well as
Waste of all descriptions is on the move.
Increasing amounts, especially of waste paper, plastics and metals are being shipped from developed countries to countries where environmental standards are less stringent.
Huge ships steam around the high seas everyday carrying goods from emerging markets in Asia to the West.
Rather than sail back empty, and needing something to provide ballast, the ship owners are only too happy to take waste products from Europe to be recycled back in Asia.
That does not mean that shipments of waste are not regulated. Both the UN and the EU have strict rules on what can be shipped where.
At the global level international trade of 'hazardous wastes' (waste that is potentially dangerous for people or the environment) is regulated by the UN's Basel Convention.
The ban contained in this Convention has not been signed by enough countries to bring it into force globally.
However, the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows 'hazardous waste' be exported to 'developed countries' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place.
A 'developed country', for the purpose of the restrictions, is defined as a member of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The EU's long term aim is that each Member State should dispose of its own waste domestically (the 'proximity principle').
However, as shipments of hazardous and problematic waste for
Despite the difficulties associated with finding, checking and analysing data on waste, the EEA in partnership with the 'European Topic Centre on Resource and Waste management' has carried out an analysis of shipments of waste from the EU to other regions.
36 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / WASTE SHIPMENTS
Driving forces behind recycling regions is expected to be significantly higher.
This suggests that the EU ban on the trade of hazardous waste with non-OECD countries is being broken.
Using European trade statistics it is possible to identify the amounts, size and value of exports of used electronic and electrical products shipped from the EU to other regions (Figure 1).
In 2005, more than 15 000 tonnes of colour television sets were exported from the EU to African countries.
In Nigeria, Ghana and Egypt alone about 1 000 TV sets arrived every day.
The average value of exported colour television sets to Africa is very low: for Africa as a whole the price per unit was EUR 64 and EUR 28 on average for the three countries mentioned above.
In comparison, TV sets traded within Europe have an average value of EUR 350.
The low value per unit for TV sets sent to Africa suggests that many of these exports are in fact used products, much of which is likely to be waste.As these figures are for television sets only, the total export of used computers, mobile phones, CD players etc. to these
Between 1995 and 2007 (Figure 2), shipments of non-hazardous waste such as paper, plastic and metals shipped out of the EU also increased dramatically, mostly to Asia, particularly China.
The amount of waste paper exported to Asia increased by a factor of ten.
For plastics the increase has been a factor of eleven and for metals a factor of five.
The shipped waste has also increased within the EU, but at much lower level.
In 2007 as much waste paper was shipped to Asia as was shipped from one EU country to another.
The quantity of metals shipped within the EU was larger than the amount shipped to Asia.
For over a decade, the cost of raw materials has been very high and this, in turn, has increased the value of secondary raw materials reclaimed through recycling.
For example, the amount of paper and cardboard 'packaging waste' that is recycled increased from about 24 to 30 million tonnes between 1997 and 2005.
The amount of plastic packaging recycled has increased from about 10 to 14 million tonnes in the same period.
Is it good for the environment?The use of recycled waste materials instead of virgin materials is generally good for the environment.
For example, a kilo of paper made from recycled raw materials uses half the energy of production using virgin materials.
Aluminium produced from recycled aluminium can use as little 5 % of the energy needed using virgin materials.
In general, recycling therefore contributes substantially to the reduction of energy-related emissions of COst and

Within the EU it is possible to ship all kinds of wastes for disposal or recovery between Member States.
Everyday a freight train carries 700 tonnes of municipal waste from Naples in Italy to Hamburg in Northern Germany for incineration (with energy recovery) This eases the waste 'situation' in Naples in the short term, but a more sustainable solution will have to be found.

Environmental stories for 2010
Signals is an annual publication from the EEA.
Here are some topics that may feature in 2010:
Better policy needs better information
Arctic Ocean
Passengers on ferries sailing between Northern Denmark and Norway can view information on the sea water below relayed on TV screens. The data are collected by specialised equipment on the ships and are used by researchers to monitor the marine environment in the area.
The simple act of making environmental information, gathered for research purposes, available to the passengers is a simple but important step — one that must be replicated on a much grander scale if we are to make full use of the data and engage and empower the public environmentally.
Robust, far-sighted policy also requires better, more detailed information.
The European Environment Agency wants to help drive technology, particularly the Internet, in new directions in terms of its interaction with the environment.
Two new EU initiatives, in which the EEA is playing a leading role and which will be further developed throughout 2009, are at the heart of this drive.
They are the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS).GMES will use satellites and sensors on the ground, floating in the water or flying through the air to monitor our natural environment.
The information provided through the GMES initiative will help us understand better how, and in what way our planet may be changing, why this is happening, and how this might influence our daily lives.
As temperatures rise and sea ice melts, expectations of large undiscovered oil and gas resources are already driving the focus of the oil industry and governments northwards towards the Arctic Ocean, according to the EEA report, ‘Impacts of Europe’s changing climate’, published in 2008.As marine species move northwards with warmer sea and less ice, fishing fleets will follow.
It is, however, difficult to tell whether the fisheries will become richer or not.
Fish species react differently to changes in marine climate, and it is difficult to predict whether the timing of the annual plankton blooms will continue to match the growth of larvae and young fish.
Shipping and tourism are likely to increase, although drift ice, short sailing seasons and lack of infrastructure will impede a rapid development of transcontinental shipping.
Traffic linked to extraction of Arctic resources on the fringes of the Arctic sea routes will most likely grow first.
While these activities offer new economic opportunities, they also represent new pressures and risks for an ocean that has until now been protected from most economic activities by the ice.
