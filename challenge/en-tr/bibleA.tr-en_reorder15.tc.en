God created the large sea creatures , and every living creature that moves , with which the waters swarmed , after their kind , and every winged bird after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the birds of the sky , and over the livestock , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth . "
God blessed them . God said to them , " Be fruitful , multiply , fill the earth , and subdue it . have dominion over the fish of the sea , over the birds of the sky , and over every living thing that moves on the earth . "
God said , " behold , I have given you every herb yielding seed , which is on the surface of all the earth , and every tree , which bears fruit yielding seed . it will be your food .
to every animal of the earth , and to every bird of the sky , and to everything that creeps on the earth , in which there is life , I have given every green herb for food " ; and it was so .
this is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens .
no plant of the field was yet in the earth , and no herb of the field had yet sprung up ; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth . there was not a man to till the ground ,
out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden , and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die . "
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden , God has said , ' You shall not eat of it , neither shall you touch it , lest you die . ' "
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was a delight to the eyes , and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise , she took of its fruit , and ate ; and she gave some to her husband with her , and he ate .
they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden .
by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are dust , and to dust you shall return . "
so he drove out the man ; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden , and the flame of a sword which turned every way , to guard the way to the tree of life .
from now on , when you till the ground , it won 't yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . "
behold , you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground . I will be hidden from your face , and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me . "
Yahweh said , " I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground ; man , along with animals , creeping things , and birds of the sky ; for I am sorry that I have made them . "
you shall make a roof in the ship , and you shall finish it to a cubit upward . you shall set the door of the ship in its side . you shall make it with lower , second , and third levels .
I , even I , do bring the flood of waters on this earth , to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky . everything that is in the earth will die .
but I will establish my Covenant with you . you shall come into the ship , you , your sons , your wife , and your sons ' wives with you .
of the birds after their kind , of the livestock after their kind , of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind , two of every sort shall come to you , to keep them alive .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the surface of the ground . "
in the six hundredth year of Noah 's life , in the second month , on the seventeenth day of the month , on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open , and the sky 's windows were opened .
in the same day Noah , and Shem , ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , entered into the ship ;
they , and every animal after its kind , all the livestock after their kind , every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind , and every bird after its kind , every bird of every sort .
the flood was forty days on the earth . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the earth .
every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground , including man , livestock , creeping things , and birds of the sky . they were destroyed from the earth . only Noah was left , and those who were with him in the ship .
the waters receded continually until the tenth month . in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , the tops of the mountains were seen .
it happened in the six hundred first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dried up from the earth . Noah removed the covering of the ship , and looked . he saw that the surface of the ground was dried .
bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh , including birds , livestock , and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth , that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply on the earth . "
the fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth , and on every bird of the sky . everything that the ground teems with , and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand .
I will surely require your blood of your lives . at the hand of every animal I will require it . at the hand of man , even at the hand of every man 's brother , I will require the life of man .
I will establish my Covenant with you : all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood , neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth . "
and I will remember my Covenant , which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh , and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
the rainbow will be in the cloud . I will look at it , that I may remember the everlasting Covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth . "

there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram 's livestock and the herdsmen of lot 's livestock : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time .

Sarai , Abram 's wife , took Hagar the Egyptian , her handmaid , after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife .

as for Ishmael , I have heard you . behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly . he will become the father of twelve princes , and I will make him a great nation .

but he lingered ; and the men grabbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two daughters ' hands , Yahweh being merciful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .

he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace .

lot went up out of Zoar , and lived in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he was afraid to live in Zoar . he lived in a cave with his two daughters .

God heard the voice of the boy . the angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky , and said to her , " What ails you , Hagar ? Don 't be afraid . for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is .
Abraham rose early in the morning , and saddled his donkey , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son . he split the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went to the place of which God had told him .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Abraham built the altar there , and laid the wood in order , bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar , on the wood .
Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns . Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son .
that I will bless you greatly , and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens , and like the sand which is on the seashore . your seed will possess the gate of his enemies .
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which he has , which is in the end of his field . for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying @-@ place . "
now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth . Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
Abraham listened to Ephron . Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , according to the current merchants ' standard .
after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre ( that is , Hebron ) , in the land of Canaan .

the young lady was very beautiful to look at , a virgin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pitcher , and came up .
he said , " blessed be Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master . as for me , Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of my master 's relatives . "
he said to me , ' Yahweh , before whom I walk , will send his angel with you , and prosper your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
behold , I am standing by this spring of water . let it happen , that the maiden who comes out to draw , to whom I will say , " Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink , "
I bowed my head , and worshiped Yahweh , and blessed Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , who had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter for his son .
the servant brought out jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing , and gave them to Rebekah . he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother .
Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , there were camels coming .
but to the sons of Abraham 's concubines , Abraham gave gifts . he sent them away from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , eastward , to the east country .
Isaac and Ishmael , his sons , buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron , the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ,
now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's handmaid , bore to Abraham .
these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebaioth , then Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
these are the years of the life of Ishmael : one hundred thirty @-@ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram , the sister of Laban the Syrian , to be his wife .
live in this land , and I will be with you , and will bless you . for to you , and to your seed , I will give all these lands , and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father .
it happened , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was caressing Rebekah , his wife .
now all the wells which his father 's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped , and filled with earth .
Isaac dug again the wells of water , which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father . for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham . he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
when Esau was forty years old , he took as wife Judith , the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basemath , the daughter of Elon the Hittite .
it happened , that when Isaac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called Esau his elder son , and said to him , " My son ? " he said to him , " Here I am . "
make me savory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my soul may bless you before I die . "
he said , " Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's venison , that my soul may bless you . " he brought it near to him , and he ate . he brought him wine , and he drank .
he came near , and kissed him . he smelled the smell of his clothing , and blessed him , and said , " behold , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed .
it happened , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
Isaac his father answered him , " behold , of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling , and of the dew of the sky from above .
by your sword will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck . "
the words of Esau , her elder son , were told to Rebekah . she sent and called Jacob , her younger son , and said to him , " behold , your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you .
he came to a certain place , and stayed there all night , because the sun had set . he took one of the stones of the place , and put it under his head , and lay down in that place to sleep .
your seed will be as the dust of the earth , and you will spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south . in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed .
behold , I am with you , and will keep you , wherever you go , and will bring you again into this land . for I will not leave you , until I have done that which I have spoken of to you . "
Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil on its top .
he looked , and behold , a well in the field , and , behold , three flocks of sheep lying there by it . for out of that well they watered the flocks . the stone on the well 's mouth was large .
it happened , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban , his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Laban , his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the flock of Laban his mother 's brother .
it happened , when Laban heard the news of Jacob , his sister 's son , that he ran to meet Jacob , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . Jacob told Laban all these things .
I will pass through all your flock today , removing from there every speckled and spotted one , and every black one among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goats . this will be my hire .
that day , he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted , and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted , every one that had white in it , and all the black ones among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering @-@ troughs where the flocks came to drink . they conceived when they came to drink .
Jacob separated the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban : and he put his own droves apart , and didn 't put them into Laban 's flock .
it happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and behold , the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked , speckled , and grizzled .
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and behold , all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked , speckled , and grizzled , for I have seen all that Laban does to you .
and he took away all his livestock , and all his possessions which he had gathered , including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram , to go to Isaac his father , to the land of Canaan .
Laban went into Jacob 's tent , into Leah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he didn 't find them . he went out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses , and of all the truth , which you have shown to your servant ; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I have become two companies .
please deliver me from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he come and strike me , and the mothers with the children .
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every herd by itself , and said to his servants , " Pass over before me , and put a space between herd and herd . "
therefore the children of Israel don 't eat the sinew of the hip , which is on the hollow of the thigh , to this day , because he touched the hollow of Jacob 's thigh in the sinew of the hip .
Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Esau was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Leah , Rachel , and the two handmaids .
please let my lord pass over before his servant , and I will lead on gently , according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lord to Seir . "
he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , the prince of the land , saw her . he took her , lay with her , and humbled her .
then will we give our daughters to you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor , and to Shechem his son ; and every male was circumcised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
they killed Hamor and Shechem , his son , with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went away .
let us arise , and go up to Bethel . I will make there an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
so Jacob came to Luz ( that is , Bethel ) , which is in the land of Canaan , he and all the people who were with him .
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him , a pillar of stone . he poured out a drink offering on it , and poured oil on it .
Esau took his wives , his sons , his daughters , and all the members of his household , with his livestock , all his animals , and all his possessions , which he had gathered in the land of Canaan , and went into a land away from his brother Jacob .
these are the names of Esau 's sons : Eliphaz , the son of Adah , the wife of Esau ; and Reuel , the son of Basemath , the wife of Esau .
these are the sons of Reuel , Esau 's son : chief Nahath , chief Zerah , chief Shammah , chief Mizzah : these are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Basemath , Esau 's wife .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Timna , chief Alvah , chief Jetheth ,
for behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and behold , my sheaf arose and also stood upright ; and behold , your sheaves came around , and bowed down to my sheaf . "
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the pits , and we will say , ' An evil animal has devoured him . ' we will see what will become of his dreams . "
Reuben said to them , " shed no blood . throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness , but lay no hand on him " --that he might deliver him out of their hand , to restore him to his father .
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stripped Joseph of his coat , the coat of many colors that was on him ;
they sat down to eat bread , and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead , with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt .
Midianites who were merchants passed by , and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver . they brought Joseph into Egypt .
Onan knew that the seed wouldn 't be his ; and it happened , when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest he should give seed to his brother .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there .
it happened , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your servant did to me , " that his wrath was kindled .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison . whatever they did there , he was responsible for it .
it happened after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Baker offended their lord , the king of Egypt .
they both dreamed a dream , each man his dream , in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the cupbearer and the Baker of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
within three more days , Pharaoh will lift up your head , and restore you to your office . you will give Pharaoh 's cup into his hand , the way you did when you were his cupbearer .
within three more days , Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you , and will hang you on a tree ; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you . "
it happened the third day , which was Pharaoh 's birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants , and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief Baker among his servants .
behold , seven other cattle came up after them out of the river , ugly and thin , and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's magicians and wise men . Pharaoh told them his dreams , but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh .
there was with us there a young man , a Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams . to each man according to his dream he interpreted .
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " I have dreamed a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it . I have heard it said of you , that when you hear a dream you can interpret it . "
and when they had eaten them up , it couldn 't be known that they had eaten them , but they were still ugly , as at the beginning . so I awoke .
the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain . I told it to the magicians , but there was no one who could explain it to me . "
let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint overseers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt 's produce in the seven plenteous years .
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not perish through the famine . "
Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in robes of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ,
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was around every city , he laid up in the same .
he said , " behold , I have heard that there is grain in Egypt . go down there , and buy for us from there , so that we may live , and not die . "
Joseph was the governor over the land . it was he who sold to all the people of the land . Joseph 's brothers came , and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth .
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain , and to restore each man 's money into his sack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
the man , the lord of the land , said to us , ' By this I will know that you are honest men : leave one of your brothers with me , and take grain for the famine of your houses , and go your way .
it happened as they emptied their sacks , that behold , each man 's bundle of money was in his sack . when they and their father saw their bundles of money , they were afraid .
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
when we came to the lodging place , we opened our sacks , and behold , each man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight . we have brought it back in our hand .
when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed themselves down to him to the earth .
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyptians , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyptians don 't eat bread with the Hebrews , for that is an abomination to the Egyptians .
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan . how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord 's house ?
he said , " Far be it from me that I should do so . the man in whose hand the cup is found , he will be my bondservant ; but as for you , go up in peace to your father . "
then Judah came near to him , and said , " Oh , my lord , please let your servant speak a word in my lord 's ears , and don 't let your anger burn against your servant ; for you are even as Pharaoh .
we said , ' We can 't go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
then Joseph couldn 't control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cried , " Cause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
so now it wasn 't you who sent me here , but God , and he has made me a father to Pharaoh , lord of all his house , and ruler over all the land of Egypt .
hurry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lord of all Egypt . come down to me . Don 't wait .
you shall dwell in the land of Goshen , and you will be near to me , you , your children , your children 's children , your flocks , your herds , and all that you have .
the report of it was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , " Joseph 's brothers have come . " it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the fat of the land . '
they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said to them . when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob , their father , revived .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two souls . all the souls of the house of Jacob , who came into Egypt , were seventy .
Joseph prepared his chariot , and went up to meet Israel , his father , in Goshen . he presented himself to him , and fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
Joseph said to his brothers , and to his father 's house , " I will go up , and speak with Pharaoh , and will tell him , ' My brothers , and my father 's house , who were in the land of Canaan , have come to me .
that you shall say , ' Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now , both we , and our fathers : ' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians . "
then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh , and said , " My father and my brothers , with their flocks , their herds , and all that they own , have come out of the land of Canaan ; and behold , they are in the land of Goshen . "
they said to Pharaoh , " We have come to live as foreigners in the land , for there is no pasture for your servants ' flocks . for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan . now therefore , please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen . "
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the grain which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came to Joseph , and said , " Give us bread , for why should we die in your presence ? for our money fails . "
they brought their livestock to Joseph , and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses , and for the flocks , and for the herds , and for the donkeys : and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year .
as for the people , he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it .
it will happen at the harvests , that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh , and four parts will be your own , for seed of the field , for your food , for them of your households , and for food for your little ones . "
now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt , are mine ; Ephraim and Manasseh , even as Reuben and Simeon , will be mine .
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yours . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance .
as for me , when I came from Paddan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way , when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath , and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath ( the same is Bethlehem ) . "
Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
the angel who has redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads , and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac . let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth . "
when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim , it displeased him . he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from Ephraim 's head to Manasseh 's head .
my soul , don 't come into their council . my glory , don 't be united to their assembly ; for in their anger they killed men . in their self @-@ will they hamstrung cattle .
the scepter will not depart from Judah , nor the ruler 's staff from between his feet , until he comes to whom it belongs . to him will the obedience of the peoples be .
but his bow remained strong . the arms of his hands were made strong , by the hands of the mighty One of Jacob , ( from there is the shepherd , the stone of Israel ) ,
even by the God of your father , who will help you ; by the Almighty , who will bless you , with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lies below , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb .
the blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors , above the boundaries of the ancient hills . they will be on the head of Joseph , on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers .
when the days of weeping for him were past , Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh , saying , " If now I have found favor in your eyes , please speak in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field , for a possession of a burial site , from Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jacob ) :
and he said , " When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women , and see them on the birth stool ; if it is a son , then you shall kill him ; but if it is a daughter , then she shall live . "
when she could no longer hide him , she took a papyrus basket for him , and coated it with tar and with pitch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the reeds by the river 's bank .
she opened it , and saw the child , and behold , the baby cried . she had compassion on him , and said , " This is one of the Hebrews ' children . "
it happened in those days , when Moses had grown up , that he went out to his brothers , and looked at their burdens . he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew , one of his brothers .
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to kill Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and lived in the land of Midian , and he sat down by a well .
it happened in the course of those many days , that the king of Egypt died , and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage , and they cried , and their cry came up to God because of the bondage .
now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro , his father @-@ in @-@ law , the priest of Midian , and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness , and came to God 's mountain , to Horeb .
the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush . he looked , and behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
moreover he said , " I am the God of your father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . " Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look at God .
I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land , to a land flowing with milk and honey ; to the place of the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
now , behold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them .
Moses said to God , " behold , when I come to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' The God of your fathers has sent me to you ; ' and they ask me , ' What is his name ? ' what should I tell them ? "
God said moreover to Moses , " You shall tell the children of Israel this , ' Yahweh , the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has sent me to you . ' this is my name forever , and this is my memorial to all generations .
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite , to a land flowing with milk and honey . " '
I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , and it will happen that when you go , you shall not go empty @-@ handed .
but every woman shall ask of her neighbor , and of her who visits her house , jewels of silver , jewels of gold , and clothing ; and you shall put them on your sons , and on your daughters . you shall plunder the Egyptians . "
he said , " Put your hand inside your cloak again . " he put his hand inside his cloak again , and when he took it out of his cloak , behold , it had turned again as his other flesh .
it will happen , if they will not believe even these two signs , neither listen to your voice , that you shall take of the water of the river , and pour it on the dry land . the water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land . "
you shall speak to him , and put the words in his mouth . I will be with your mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what you shall do .
the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spoke to the people , saying , " This is what Pharaoh says : ' I will not give you straw .
the officers of the children of Israel , whom Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Why haven 't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today , in making brick as before ? "
I have also established my Covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their travels , in which they lived as aliens .
moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage , and I have remembered my Covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God , who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations : Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari ; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty @-@ seven years .
the sons of Kohath : Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel ; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty @-@ three years .
Amram took Jochebed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty @-@ seven years .
Eleazar Aaron 's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife ; and she bore him Phinehas . these are the heads of the fathers ' houses of the Levites according to their families .
these are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Moses and Aaron .
you shall speak all that I command you ; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
but Pharaoh will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
go to Pharaoh in the morning . behold , he goes out to the water ; and you shall stand by the river 's bank to meet him ; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand .
thus says Yahweh , " In this you shall know that I am Yahweh . behold , I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
Moses and Aaron did so , as Yahweh commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and struck the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Pharaoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became foul , and the Egyptians couldn 't drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the river shall swarm with frogs , which shall go up and come into your house , and into your bedroom , and on your bed , and into the house of your servants , and on your people , and into your ovens , and into your kneading troughs :
Yahweh said to Moses , " Tell Aaron , ' Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers , over the streams , and over the pools , and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt . ' "
they did so ; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and struck the dust of the earth , and there were lice on man , and on animal ; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh ; behold , he comes out to the water ; and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh says , " Let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if you will not let my people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies on you , and on your servants , and on your people , and into your houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the earth .
Yahweh did so ; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies .
behold , the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field , on the horses , on the donkeys , on the camels , on the herds , and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence .
Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt ; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel . " ' "
Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead . but the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn , and he didn 't let the people go .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
behold , tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand toward the sky , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , on man , and on animal , and on every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt . "
the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the hail struck every herb of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
Moses said to him , " As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh . the thunders shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh 's .
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son , and of your son 's son , what things I have done to Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that you may know that I am Yahweh . "
Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh , and said to him , " This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : ' how long will you refuse to humble yourself before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
and they shall cover the surface of the earth , so that one won 't be able to see the earth . they shall eat the residue of that which has escaped , which remains to you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field .
your houses shall be filled , and the houses of all your servants , and the houses of all the Egyptians ; as neither your fathers nor your fathers ' fathers have seen , since the day that they were on the earth to this day . ' " he turned , and went out from Pharaoh .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up on the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail has left . "
Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt , and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day , and all the night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very grievous . before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
speak now in the ears of the people , and let them ask every man of his neighbor , and every woman of her neighbor , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold . "
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharaoh 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne , even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
but against any of the children of Israel a dog won 't even bark or move its tongue , against man or animal ; that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel .
all these your servants shall come down to me , and bow down themselves to me , saying , " Get out , with all the people who follow you " ; and after that I will go out . ' " he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger .
speak to all the Congregation of Israel , saying , ' On the tenth day of this month , they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to their fathers ' houses , a lamb for a household ;
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
this is how you shall eat it : with your belt on your waist , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in haste : it is Yahweh 's Passover .
for I will go through the land of Egypt in that night , and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and animal . against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments : I am Yahweh .
" ' seven days you shall eat unleavened bread ; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses , for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation , and in the seventh day a holy convocation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever .
there shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days , for whoever eats that which is leavened , that soul shall be cut off from the Congregation of Israel , whether he be a foreigner , or one who is born in the land .
you shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the basin , and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin ; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning .
for Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians ; and when he sees the blood on the lintel , and on the two doorposts , Yahweh will pass over the door , and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you .
it shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you , according as he has promised , that you shall keep this service .
that you shall say , ' It is the sacrifice of Yahweh 's Passover , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he struck the Egyptians , and spared our houses . ' " the people bowed their heads and worshiped .
it happened at midnight , that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing .
they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it wasn 't leavened , because they were thrust out of Egypt , and couldn 't wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
it happened at the end of four hundred thirty years , even the same day it happened , that all the armies of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt . this is that night of Yahweh , to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations .
in one house shall it be eaten ; you shall not carry out anything of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall you break a bone of it .
it shall be , when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Amorite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite , which he swore to your fathers to give you , a land flowing with milk and honey , that you shall keep this service in this month .
that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb , and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal . the males shall be Yahweh 's .
every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb ; and if you will not redeem it , then you shall break its neck ; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons .
but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt .
Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud , to lead them on their way , and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light , that they might go by day and by night :
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
when Pharaoh drew near , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and behold , the Egyptians were marching after them ; and they were very afraid . the children of Israel cried out to Yahweh .
Isn 't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt , saying , ' Leave us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? ' for it were better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness . "
I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall go in after them : and I will get myself honor over Pharaoh , and over all his armies , over his chariots , and over his horsemen .
the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it . Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh , and said , " I will sing to Yahweh , for he has triumphed gloriously . the horse and his Rider he has thrown into the sea .
" you , in your loving kindness , have led the people that you have redeemed . you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation .
you shall bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance , the place , Yahweh , which you have made for yourself to dwell in ; the sanctuary , Lord , which your hands have established .
for the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them ; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea .
they took their journey from Elim , and all the Congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud .
" I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel . speak to them , saying , ' At evening you shall eat meat , and in the morning you shall be filled with bread : and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God . ' "
when the dew that lay had gone , behold , on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing , small as the Frost on the ground .
when they measured it with an Omer , he who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little had no lack . they gathered every man according to his eating .
notwithstanding they didn 't listen to Moses , but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and became foul : and Moses was angry with them .
the children of Israel ate the manna forty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan .
all the Congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of sin , by their journeys , according to Yahweh 's commandment , and encamped in Rephidim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
behold , I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb . you shall strike the rock , and water will come out of it , that the people may drink . " Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
it happened , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
now Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt .
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped , at the Mountain of God .
Moses went out to meet his father @-@ in @-@ law , and bowed and kissed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Moses told his father @-@ in @-@ law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , all the hardships that had come on them on the way , and how Yahweh delivered them .
Jethro said , " blessed be Yahweh , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh ; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God . Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law before God .
you shall teach them the statutes and the laws , and shall show them the way in which they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God : men of truth , hating unjust gain ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
let them judge the people at all times . it shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you , but every small matter they shall judge themselves . so shall it be easier for you , and they shall share the load with you .
if you will do this thing , and God commands you so , then you will be able to endure , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai .
when they had departed from Rephidim , and had come to the wilderness of Sinai , they encamped in the wilderness ; and there Israel encamped before the mountain .
Moses went up to God , and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
it happened on the third day , when it was morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud on the mountain , and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet ; and all the people who were in the camp trembled .
" you shall not make for yourselves an idol , nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
you shall not bow yourself down to them , nor serve them , for I , Yahweh your God , am a Jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me ,
but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God . you shall not do any work in it , you , nor your son , nor your daughter , your male servant , nor your female servant , nor your livestock , nor your stranger who is within your gates ;
" you shall not covet your neighbor 's house . you shall not covet your neighbor 's wife , nor his male servant , nor his female servant , nor his ox , nor his donkey , nor anything that is your neighbor 's . "
all the people perceived the thunderings , the lightnings , the sound of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they trembled , and stayed at a distance .
you shall make an altar of earth for me , and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings , your sheep and your cattle . in every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you .
if you make me an altar of stone , you shall not build it of cut stones ; for if you lift up your tool on it , you have polluted it .
if she doesn 't please her master , who has married her to himself , then he shall let her be redeemed . he shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people , since he has dealt deceitfully with her .
if he rises again and walks around with his staff , then he who struck him shall be cleared : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall provide for his healing until he is thoroughly healed .
but if the bull had a habit of goring in the past , and it has been testified to its owner , and he has not kept it in , but it has killed a man or a woman , the bull shall be stoned , and its owner shall also be put to death .
or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of goring in the past , and its owner has not kept it in , he shall surely pay bull for bull , and the dead animal shall be his own .
" if a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten , and lets his animal loose , and it grazes in another man 's field , he shall make restitution from the best of his own field , and from the best of his own vineyard .
if the thief isn 't found , then the master of the house shall come near to God , to find out if he hasn 't put his hand to his neighbor 's goods .
for that is his only covering , it is his garment for his skin . what would he sleep in ? it will happen , when he cries to me , that I will hear , for I am gracious .
" be careful to do all things that I have said to you ; and don 't invoke the name of other gods , neither let them be heard out of your mouth .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread . seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , as I commanded you , at the time appointed in the month Abib ( for in it you came out from Egypt ) , and no one shall appear before me empty .
for my angel shall go before you , and bring you in to the Amorite , the Hittite , the Perizzite , the Canaanite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite ; and I will cut them off .
I will send my terror before you , and will confuse all the people to whom you come , and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you .
I will set your border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines , and from the wilderness to the River ; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand , and you shall drive them out before you .
Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh , and all the ordinances ; and all the people answered with one voice , and said , " All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do . "
according to all that I show you , the pattern of the tabernacle , and the pattern of all of its furniture , even so you shall make it .
" they shall make an Ark of acacia wood . its length shall be two and a half cubits , its breadth a cubit and a half , and a cubit and a half its height .
you shall cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in its four feet . two rings shall be on the one side of it , and two rings on the other side of it .

Aaron said to them , " Take off the golden rings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them to me . "
he received what they handed him , and fashioned it with an engraving tool , and made it a molten calf ; and they said , " These are your gods , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . "
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them . they have made themselves a molten calf , and have worshiped it , and have sacrificed to it , and said , ' These are your gods , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . ' "
why should the Egyptians speak , saying , ' He brought them forth for evil , to kill them in the mountains , and to consume them from the surface of the earth ? ' turn from your fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against your people .
Moses turned , and went down from the mountain , with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand ; tablets that were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other they were written .
he said , " It isn 't the voice of those who shout for victory , neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome ; but the noise of those who sing that I hear . "
it happened , as soon as he came near to the camp , that he saw the calf and the dancing : and Moses ' anger grew hot , and he threw the tablets out of his hands , and broke them beneath the mountain .
he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it with fire , ground it to powder , and scattered it on the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said to me , ' Make us gods , which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we don 't know what has become of him . '
he said to them , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' Every man put his sword on his thigh , and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp , and every man kill his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbor . ' "
now go , lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you . behold , my angel shall go before you . nevertheless in the day when I punish , I will punish them for their sin . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , " depart , go up from here , you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt , to the land of which I swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , ' I will give it to your seed . '
now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp , far away from the camp , and he called it " The tent of Meeting . " it happened that everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the tent of Meeting , which was outside the camp .
it happened that when Moses went out to the tent , that all the people rose up , and stood , everyone at their tent door , and watched Moses , until he had gone into the tent .
all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent , and all the people rose up and worshiped , everyone at their tent door .
Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face , as a man speaks to his friend . he turned again into the camp , but his servant Joshua , the son of nun , a young man , didn 't depart out of the tent .
now therefore , if I have found favor in your sight , please show me now your ways , that I may know you , so that I may find favor in your sight : and consider that this nation is your people . "
it will happen , while my glory passes by , that I will put you in a cleft of the rock , and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by ;
he chiseled two tablets of stone like the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up to Mount Sinai , as Yahweh had commanded him , and took in his hand two stone tablets .
keeping loving kindness for thousands , forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin ; and that will by no means clear the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , and on the children 's children , on the third and on the fourth generation . "
be careful , lest you make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going , lest it be for a snare in the midst of you :

" you shall keep the feast of unleavened bread . seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , as I commanded you , at the time appointed in the month Abib ; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt .
for I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders ; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh , your God , three times in the year .
" you shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God . " you shall not boil a young goat in its mother 's milk . "
it happened , when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses ' hand , when he came down from the mountain , that Moses didn 't know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him .
when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come near him .
but when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him , he took the veil off , until he came out ; and he came out , and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
the finely worked garments , for ministering in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office . ' "
they came , everyone whose heart stirred him up , and everyone whom his spirit made willing , and brought Yahweh 's offering , for the work of the tent of Meeting , and for all of its service , and for the holy garments .
the children of Israel brought a freewill offering to Yahweh ; every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work , which Yahweh had commanded to be made by Moses .
Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab , and every wise @-@ hearted man , in whose heart Yahweh had put wisdom , even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it :
all the wise @-@ hearted men among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains ; of fine twined linen , blue , purple , and scarlet , with cherubim , the work of the skillful workman , they made them .
he made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the edge in the coupling . likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling .
he made fifty loops in the one curtain , and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling . the loops were opposite one to another .
he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling , and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain which was outmost in the second coupling .
Bezalel made the Ark of acacia wood . its length was two and a half cubits , and its breadth a cubit and a half , and a cubit and a half its height .

the cherubim spread out their wings on high , covering the mercy seat with their wings , with their faces toward one another . the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat .
he made the lampstand of pure gold . he made the lampstand of beaten work . its base , its Shaft , its cups , its buds , and its flowers were of one piece with it .
there were six branches going out of its sides : three branches of the lampstand out of its one side , and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side :
three cups made like almond blossoms in one branch , a bud and a flower , and three cups made like almond blossoms in the other branch , a bud and a flower : so for the six branches going out of the lampstand .
and a bud under two branches of one piece with it , and a bud under two branches of one piece with it , and a bud under two branches of one piece with it , for the six branches going out of it .
he made the altar of incense of acacia wood . it was square : its length was a cubit , and its breadth a cubit . its height was two cubits . its horns were of one piece with it .
he made all the vessels of the altar , the pots , the shovels , the basins , the forks , and the fire pans . he made all its vessels of brass .
he made the basin of brass , and its base of brass , out of the mirrors of the ministering women who ministered at the door of the tent of Meeting .
and so for the other side : on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
the sockets for the pillars were of brass . the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver ; and the overlaying of their capitals , of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver .
the screen for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer , of blue , purple , scarlet , and fine twined linen . twenty cubits was the length , and the height in the breadth was five cubits , like to the hangings of the court .
this is the amount of material used for the tabernacle , even the Tabernacle of the testimony , as they were counted , according to the commandment of Moses , for the service of the Levites , by the hand of Ithamar , the son of Aaron the priest .
all the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary , even the gold of the offering , was twenty @-@ nine talents , and seven hundred thirty shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary .

a Beka a head , that is , half a shekel , after the shekel of the sanctuary , for everyone who passed over to those who were numbered , from twenty years old and upward , for six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty men .
they beat the gold into thin plates , and cut it into wires , to work it in the blue , in the purple , in the scarlet , and in the fine linen , the work of the skillful workman .
the skillfully woven band that was on it , with which to fasten it on , was of the same piece , like its work ; of gold , of blue , purple , scarlet , and fine twined linen ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
they worked the onyx stones , enclosed in settings of gold , engraved with the engravings of a signet , according to the names of the children of Israel .

they bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it might be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod , and that the breastplate might not come loose from the ephod , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
" you shall take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is in it , and shall make it holy , and all its furniture : and it will be holy .

you shall anoint them , as you anointed their father , that they may minister to me in the priest 's office . their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations . "
he raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the screen of the gate of the court . so Moses finished the work .
for the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day , and there was fire in the cloud by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their journeys .

God 's anger was kindled because he went ; and the angel of Yahweh placed himself in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding on his donkey , and his two servants were with him .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and the donkey turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam struck the donkey , to turn her into the way .
the angel of Yahweh went further , and stood in a narrow place , where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and he bowed his head , and fell on his face .
when Balak heard that Balaam had come , he went out to meet him to the City of Moab , which is on the border of the Arnon , which is in the utmost part of the border .
for from the top of the rocks I see him . from the hills I see him . behold , it is a people that dwells alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
God is not a man , that he should lie , nor the son of man , that he should repent . has he said , and will he not do it ? or has he spoken , and will he not make it good ?
behold , the people rises up as a lioness , As a lion he lifts himself up . he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drinks the blood of the slain . "
God brings him out of Egypt . he has as it were the strength of the wild ox . he shall eat up the nations his adversaries , shall break their bones in pieces , and Pierce them with his arrows .
Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he struck his hands together ; and Balak said to Balaam , " I called you to curse my enemies , and , behold , you have altogether blessed them these three times .
I see him , but not now . I see him , but not near . a star will come out of Jacob . a scepter will rise out of Israel , and shall strike through the corners of Moab , and break down all the sons of Sheth .
behold , one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses , and in the sight of all the Congregation of the children of Israel , while they were weeping at the door of the tent of Meeting .
when Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he rose up from the midst of the Congregation , and took a spear in his hand ;
now the name of the man of Israel that was slain , who was slain with the Midianite woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a fathers ' house among the Simeonites .
the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was head of the people of a fathers ' house in Midian .
the sons of Eliab : Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . these are that Dathan and Abiram , who were called of the Congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against Yahweh ,
the sons of Judah after their families were : of Shelah , the family of the Shelanites ; of Perez , the family of the Perezites ; of Zerah , the family of the Zerahites .
these are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those who were numbered of them , thirty @-@ two thousand five hundred . these are the sons of Joseph after their families .
these are the families of the sons of Asher according to those who were numbered of them , fifty @-@ three thousand and four hundred .
to the more you shall give the more inheritance , and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance : to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given .
these are those who were numbered of the Levites after their families : of Gershon , the family of the Gershonites ; of Kohath , the family of the Kohathites ; of Merari , the family of the Merarites .
these are the families of Levi : the family of the Libnites , the family of the Hebronites , the family of the Mahlites , the family of the Mushites , the family of the Korahites . Kohath became the father of Amram .
the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , who was born to Levi in Egypt : and she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
those who were numbered of them were twenty @-@ three thousand , every male from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of Israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel .
but among these there was not a man of them who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
" our father died in the wilderness , and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah : but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
" the daughters of Zelophehad speak right : you shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father 's brothers ; and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them .
you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' If a man dies , and has no son , then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter .
because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin , in the strife of the Congregation , to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes . " ( these are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin . )
who may go out before them , and who may come in before them , and who may lead them out , and who may bring them in ; that the Congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which have no shepherd . "
he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the Congregation . "
and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for each bull ; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for the one ram ;
their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull , and the third part of a hin for the ram , and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb : this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
in this way you shall offer daily , for seven days , the food of the offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh : it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering , and the drink offering of it .
" ' also in the day of the first fruits , when you offer a new meal offering to Yahweh in your feast of weeks , you shall have a holy convocation ; you shall do no servile work ;
" ' in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , you shall have a holy convocation ; you shall do no servile work : it is a day of blowing of trumpets to you .
" ' you shall offer these to Yahweh in your set feasts , besides your vows , and your freewill offerings , for your burnt offerings , and for your meal offerings , and for your drink offerings , and for your peace offerings . ' "
and her father hears her vow , and her bond with which she has bound her soul , and her father holds his peace at her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand .
but if her father disallow her in the day that he hears , none of her vows , or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul , shall stand : and Yahweh will forgive her , because her father disallowed her .
and her husband hears it , and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it ; then her vows shall stand , and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand .
but if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it , then he shall make void her vow which is on her , and the rash utterance of her lips , with which she has bound her soul : and Yahweh will forgive her .
but if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them , then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her soul , shall not stand : her husband has made them void ; and Yahweh will forgive her .
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day , then he establishes all her vows , or all her bonds , which are on her : he has established them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
Moses sent them , one thousand of every tribe , to the war , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand .
they killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain : Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , the five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword .
the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones ; and all their livestock , and all their flocks , and all their goods , they took for a prey .
they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , to Moses , and to Eleazar the priest , and to the Congregation of the children of Israel , to the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by the Jordan at Jericho .
Moses was angry with the officers of the army , the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , who came from the service of the war .
as to every garment , and all that is made of skin , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood , you shall purify yourselves . "
" take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of animal , you , and Eleazar the priest , and the heads of the fathers ' households of the Congregation ;
levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle : one soul of five hundred ; of the persons , of the cattle , of the donkeys , and of the flocks .
and thirty @-@ two thousand persons in all , of the women who had not known man by lying with him .
even of the children of Israel 's half , Moses took one drawn out of every fifty , both of man and of animal , and gave them to the Levites , who performed the duty of the tabernacle of Yahweh ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the captains of thousands , and the captains of hundreds , came near to Moses ;
and they said to Moses , " Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command , and there lacks not one man of us .
all the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels .
now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock : and when they saw the land of Jazer , and the land of Gilead , that behold , the place was a place for livestock ;
for when they went up to the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them .
Yahweh 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh , was consumed .
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
and the land is subdued before Yahweh ; then afterward you shall return , and be guiltless towards Yahweh , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh .
so Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest , and to Joshua the son of nun , and to the heads of the fathers ' households of the tribes of the children of Israel .
Moses gave to them , even to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land , according to its cities and borders , even the cities of the surrounding land .
the children of Reuben built Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Kiriathaim ,
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
they traveled from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the next day after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians ,
they traveled from before Hahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness : and they went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and encamped in Marah .
Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment of Yahweh , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fifth month , on the first day of the month .
the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the South in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , destroy all their stone idols , destroy all their molten images , and demolish all their high places .
" but if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you , then those you let remain of them will be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides , and they will harass you in the land in which you dwell .
" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land of Canaan ( this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan according to its borders ) ,
and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass along to Zin ; and the goings out of it shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea ; and it shall go forth to Hazar Addar , and pass along to Azmon ;
and the border shall turn about from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad ;
and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall go down , and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward ;
for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers ' houses , and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers ' houses , have received , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh have received , their inheritance :
" command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites .
or in enmity struck him with his hand , so that he died ; he who struck him shall surely be put to death ; he is a murderer : the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death , when he meets him .
and the Congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood , and the Congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge , where he was fled : and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest , who was anointed with the holy oil .
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession .
" ' you shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge , that he may come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
" ' so you shall not pollute the land in which you are : for blood , it pollutes the land ; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him who shed it .
the heads of the fathers ' households of the family of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spoke before Moses , and before the princes , the heads of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel :
and they said , " Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters .
when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be , then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong : so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers . "
this is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them be married to whom they think best ; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married .
every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers .
it happened in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spoke to the children of Israel , according to all that Yahweh had given him in commandment to them ;
behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give to them and to their seed after them . "
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us . "
and you murmured in your tents , and said , " Because Yahweh hated us , he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
who went before you in the way , to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to show you by what way you should go , and in the cloud by day .
moreover your little ones , whom you said should be a prey , and your children , who this day have no knowledge of good or evil , they shall go in there , and to them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yourselves therefore ;
Don 't contend with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on ; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession .
you shall purchase food of them for money , that you may eat ; and you shall also buy water of them for money , that you may drink . ' "
so we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber . we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
and the Avvim , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Caphtorim , who came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" rise up , take your journey , and pass over the valley of the Arnon : behold , I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land ; begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
this day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky , who shall hear the report of you , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of you . "
from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the valley , even to Gilead , there was not a city too high for us ; Yahweh our God delivered up all before us :
only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn 't come near ; all the side of the river Jabbok , and the cities of the hill country , and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us .
Yahweh said to me , " Don 't fear him ; for I have delivered him , and all his people , and his land , into your hand ; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites , who lived at Heshbon . "
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon .
( for only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; isn 't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon ? nine cubits was its length , and four cubits its breadth , after the cubit of a man . )
this land we took in possession at that time : from Aroer , which is by the valley of the Arnon , and half the hill country of Gilead , and its cities , gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites :
and the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , the kingdom of Og , gave I to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , even all Bashan . ( the same is called the land of Rephaim .
to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon , the middle of the valley , and its border , even to the river Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
" Lord Yahweh , you have begun to show your servant your greatness , and your strong hand : for what god is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to your works , and according to your mighty acts ?
go up to the top of Pisgah , and lift up your eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and see with your eyes : for you shall not go over this Jordan .
only take heed to yourself , and keep your soul diligently , lest you forget the things which your eyes saw , and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life ; but make them known to your children and your children 's children ;
take heed to yourselves , lest you forget the Covenant of Yahweh your God , which he made with you , and make you an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you .
out of heaven he made you to hear his voice , that he might instruct you : and on earth he made you to see his great fire ; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire .
because he loved your fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought you out with his presence , with his great power , out of Egypt ;
that the manslayer might flee there , who kills his neighbor unawares , and didn 't hate him in time past ; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live :
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which Moses spoke to the children of Israel , when they came forth out of Egypt ,
( I stood between Yahweh and you at that time , to show you the word of Yahweh : for you were afraid because of the fire , and didn 't go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" you shall not make an engraved image for yourself , any likeness of what is in heaven above , or what is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
you shall not bow down yourself to them , nor serve them ; for I , Yahweh , your God , am a Jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me ;
you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt , and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm : therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day .
" neither shall you covet your neighbor 's wife ; neither shall you desire your neighbor 's house , his field , or his male servant , or his female servant , his ox , or his donkey , or anything that is your neighbor 's . "
it happened , when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , while the mountain was burning with fire , that you came near to me , even all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ;
and you said , " behold , Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that God does speak with man , and he lives .
Yahweh heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Yahweh said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
you shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess .
that you might fear Yahweh your God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prolonged .
hear therefore , Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with you , and that you may increase mightily , as Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has promised to you , in a land flowing with milk and honey .
and you shall teach them diligently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a Jealous God ; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you , and he destroy you from off the face of the earth .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their altars , and dash their pillars in pieces , and cut down their Asherim , and burn their engraved images with fire .
but because Yahweh loves you , and because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers , has Yahweh brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
Yahweh will take away from you all sickness ; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who hate you .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
who fed you in the wilderness with manna , which your fathers didn 't know ; that he might humble you , and that he might prove you , to do you good at your latter end :
remember , don 't forget , how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt , until you came to this place , you have been rebellious against Yahweh .
when I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant which Yahweh made with you , then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights ; I neither ate bread nor drank water .
Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
Yahweh said to me , " arise , get down quickly from here ; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a molten image . "
I prayed to Yahweh , and said , " Lord Yahweh , don 't destroy your people and your inheritance , that you have redeemed through your greatness , that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
lest the land you brought us out from say , ' Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them , and because he hated them , he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness . '
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Yahweh gave them to me .
( the children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his place .
know this day : for I don 't speak with your children who have not known , and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his outstretched arm ,
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and to all his land ;
and what he did to the army of Egypt , to their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day ;
and that you may prolong your days in the land , which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed , a land flowing with milk and honey .
for the land , where you go in to possess it , isn 't as the land of Egypt , that you came out from , where you sowed your seed , and watered it with your foot , as a garden of herbs ;
a land which Yahweh your God cares for : the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it , from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year .
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day , to love Yahweh your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
that I will give the rain of your land in its season , the former rain and the latter rain , that you may gather in your grain , and your new wine , and your oil .
and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you , and he shut up the sky , so that there shall be no rain , and the land shall not yield its fruit ; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you .
therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul ; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand , and they shall be for symbols between your eyes .
you shall teach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even to the hinder sea shall be your border .
no man shall be able to stand before you : Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on , as he has spoken to you .
and the curse , if you shall not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which you have not known .
it shall happen , when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it , that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim , and the curse on Mount Ebal .
Aren 't they beyond the Jordan , behind the way of the going down of the sun , in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah , over against Gilgal , beside the oaks of Moreh ?
these are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has given you to possess it , all the days that you live on the earth .
you shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods , on the high mountains , and on the hills , and under every green tree :
and you shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars , and burn their Asherim with fire ; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods ; and you shall destroy their name out of that place .
but to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes , to put his name there , even to his habitation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and the wave offering of your hand , and your vows , and your freewill offerings , and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock :
and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God , and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Yahweh your God has blessed you .
then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there , there you shall bring all that I command you : your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the wave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh .
but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
you may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain , or of your new wine , or of your oil , or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock , nor any of your vows which you vow , nor your freewill offerings , nor the wave offering of your hand ;
when Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border , as he has promised you , and you shall say , " I want to eat meat , " because your soul desires to eat meat ; you may eat meat , after all the desire of your soul .
if the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to put his name there , is too far from you , then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock , which Yahweh has given you , as I have commanded you ; and you may eat within your gates , after all the desire of your soul .
and you shall offer your burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and you shall eat the flesh .
when Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you , where you go in to dispossess them , and you dispossess them , and dwell in their land ;
take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them , after that they are destroyed from before you ; and that you not inquire after their gods , saying , " How do these nations serve their gods ? I will do likewise . "
you shall not do so to Yahweh your God : for every abomination to Yahweh , which he hates , have they done to their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , of which he spoke to you , saying , " Let us go after other gods " ( which you have not known ) " and let us serve them " ;
you shall not listen to the words of that prophet , or to that dreamer of dreams : for Yahweh your God proves you , to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
then you shall inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in the midst of you ,
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and its livestock , with the edge of the sword .
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and show you mercy , and have compassion on you , and multiply you , as he has sworn to your fathers ;
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God , and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
every animal that parts the hoof , and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud , among the animals , that may you eat .
the pig , because it has a split hoof but doesn 't chew the cud , is unclean to you : of their flesh you shall not eat , and their carcasses you shall not touch .
then you shall turn it into money , and bind up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose :
at the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year , and shall lay it up within your gates :
if a poor man , one of your brothers , is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives you , you shall not harden your heart , nor shut your hand from your poor brother ;
you shall surely give him , and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him ; because that for this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work , and in all that you put your hand to .
for the poor will never cease out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall surely open your hand to your brother , to your needy , and to your poor , in your land .
you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock , and out of your threshing floor , and out of your winepress ; as Yahweh your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
you shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which Yahweh shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
no yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days ; neither shall any of the flesh , which you sacrifice the first day at evening , remain all night until the morning .
but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell in , there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening , at the going down of the sun , at the season that you came forth out of Egypt .
you shall count for yourselves seven weeks : from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yahweh your God blesses you :
and you shall rejoice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male servant , and your female servant , and the Levite , and the foreigner , and the fatherless , and the widow , who are within your gates .
you shall keep a feast to Yahweh your God seven days in the place which Yahweh shall choose ; because Yahweh your God will bless you in all your increase , and in all the work of your hands , and you shall be altogether joyful .
you shall not wrest justice : you shall not respect persons ; neither shall you take a bribe ; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise , and pervert the words of the righteous .
if there is found in the midst of you , within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God , in transgressing his Covenant ,
and it be told you , and you have heard of it , then you shall inquire diligently ; and behold , if it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in Israel ,
then you shall bring forth that man or that woman , who has done this evil thing , to your gates , even the man or the woman ; and you shall stone them to death with stones .
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterward the hand of all the people . so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
if there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within your gates ; then you shall arise , and go up to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose ;
and you shall come to the priests the Levites , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inquire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you :
according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach you , and according to the judgment which they shall tell you , you shall do ; you shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you , to the right hand , nor to the left .
the man who does presumptuously , in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the evil from Israel .
when you have come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you , and shall possess it , and shall dwell therein , and shall say , " I will set a king over me , like all the nations that are around me " ;
you shall surely set him king over yourselves , whom Yahweh your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreigner over you , who is not your brother .
only he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he may multiply horses ; because Yahweh has said to you , " You shall not go back that way again . "
it shall be , when he sits on the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book , out of that which is before the priests the Levites :
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life ; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them ;
that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers , and that he not turn aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he and his children , in the midst of Israel .
this shall be the priests ' due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep , that they shall give to the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
the first fruits of your grain , of your new wine , and of your oil , and the first of the Fleece of your sheep , you shall give him .
if a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel , where he lives as a foreigner , and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose ;
for these nations , that you shall dispossess , listen to those who practice sorcery , and to diviners ; but as for you , Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do .
this is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers , like you ; and I will put my words in his mouth , and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him .
it shall happen , that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the prophet , who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other gods , that same prophet shall die . "
but if any man hates his neighbor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mortally so that he dies , and he flees into one of these cities ;
you shall not remove your neighbor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inheritance which you shall inherit , in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sins : at the mouth of two witnesses , or at the mouth of three witnesses , shall a matter be established .
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and see horses , chariots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Yahweh your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
the officers shall speak to the people , saying , " What man is there who has built a new house , and has not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
what man is there who has planted a vineyard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
the officers shall speak further to the people , and they shall say , " What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted ? let him go and return to his house , lest his brother 's heart melt as his heart . "
it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people , that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people .
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you , and shall serve you .
but the women , and the little ones , and the livestock , and all that is in the city , even all its spoil , you shall take for a prey to yourself ; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies , which Yahweh your God has given you .
only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food , you shall destroy and cut them down ; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you , until it fall .
and it shall be , that the city which is nearest to the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd , which hasn 't been worked with , and which has not drawn in the yoke ;
it shall be , if you have no delight in her , then you shall let her go where she will ; but you shall not sell her at all for money , you shall not deal with her as a slave , because you have humbled her .
then it shall be , in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has , that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated , who is the firstborn :
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , who will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and , though they chasten him , will not listen to them ;
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the elders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the elders of his city , " This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard . "
his body shall not remain all night on the tree , but you shall surely bury him the same day ; for he who is hanged is accursed of God ; that you don 't defile your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance .
so you shall do with his donkey ; and so you shall do with his garment ; and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother 's , which he has lost , and you have found : you may not hide yourself .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before you in the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eggs , and the hen sitting on the young , or on the eggs , you shall not take the hen with the young :
you shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed , lest the whole fruit be forfeited , the seed which you have sown , and the increase of the vineyard .
and accuses her of shameful things , and brings up an evil name on her , and says , " I took this woman , and when I came near to her , I didn 't find in her the tokens of virginity " ;
then shall the father of the young lady , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady 's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate ;
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the evil from Israel .
but if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has humbled her ; he may not put her away all his days .
because they didn 't meet you with bread and with water in the way , when you came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse you .
if there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night , then shall he go outside of the camp . he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening comes on , he shall bathe himself in water ; and when the sun is down , he shall come within the camp .
and you shall have a paddle among your weapons ; and it shall be , when you sit down abroad , you shall dig therewith , and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you :
for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp , to deliver you , and to give up your enemies before you ; therefore your camp shall be holy , that he may not see an unclean thing in you , and turn away from you .
he shall dwell with you , in the midst of you , in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates , where it pleases him best : you shall not oppress him .
you shall not bring the hire of a prostitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow : for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
to a foreigner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to possess it .
that which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God , a freewill offering , which you have promised with your mouth .
when you come into your neighbor 's vineyard , then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure ; but you shall not put any in your vessel .
when you come into your neighbor 's standing grain , then you may pluck the ears with your hand ; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor 's standing grain .
when a man takes a wife , and marries her , then it shall be , if she find no favor in his eyes , because he has found some unseemly thing in her , that he shall write her a bill of divorce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , who took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , who sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for that is abomination before Yahweh : and you shall not cause the land to sin , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance .
when a man takes a new wife , he shall not go out in the army , neither shall he be assigned any business : he shall be free at home one year , and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken .
if a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel , and he deal with him as a slave , or sell him ; then that thief shall die : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
take heed in the plague of leprosy , that you observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them , so you shall observe to do .
in his day you shall give him his hire , neither shall the sun go down on it ; for he is poor , and sets his heart on it : lest he cry against you to Yahweh , and it be sin to you .
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his wickedness , by number .
forty stripes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then your brother should seem vile to you .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him , and puts forth her hand , and takes him by the secrets ;
how he met you by the way , and struck the hindmost of you , all who were feeble behind you , when you were faint and weary ; and he didn 't fear God .
that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground , which you shall bring in from your land that Yahweh your God gives you ; and you shall put it in a basket , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
you shall come to the priest who shall be in those days , and tell him , " I profess this day to Yahweh your God , that I am come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers to give us . "
now , behold , I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground , which you , Yahweh , have given me . " you shall set it down before Yahweh your God , and worship before Yahweh your God .
you shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Levite , and the foreigner who is in the midst of you .
you have declared Yahweh this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his ordinances , and listen to his voice :
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you , that you shall set yourself up great stones , and plaster them with plaster :
it shall be , when you have passed over the Jordan , that you shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in Mount Ebal , and you shall plaster them with plaster .
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments which I command you this day , that Yahweh your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth :
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
Yahweh will make you the head , and not the tail ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be beneath ; if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day , that all these curses shall come on you , and overtake you .
Yahweh will strike you with consumption , and with fever , and with inflammation , and with fiery heat , and with the sword , and with blight , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue you until you perish .
your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky , and to the animals of the earth ; and there shall be none to frighten them away .
Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt , and with the tumors , and with the scurvy , and with the itch , of which you can not be healed .
and you shall grope at noonday , as the blind gropes in darkness , and you shall not prosper in your ways : and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always , and there shall be none to save you .
you shall betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not dwell therein : you shall plant a vineyard , and shall not use its fruit .
your ox shall be slain before your eyes , and you shall not eat of it : your donkey shall be violently taken away from before your face , and shall not be restored to you : your sheep shall be given to your enemies , and you shall have none to save you .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
Yahweh will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
the foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above you higher and higher ; and you shall come down lower and lower .
all these curses shall come on you , and shall pursue you , and overtake you , until you are destroyed ; because you didn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you :
they shall besiege you in all your gates , until your high and fortified walls come down , in which you trusted , throughout all your land ; and they shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land , which Yahweh your God has given you .
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the flesh of your sons and of your daughters , whom Yahweh your God has given you , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates .
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this glorious and fearful name , YAHWEH your God ;
it shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you , so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it .
Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples , from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth ; and there you shall serve other gods , which you have not known , you nor your fathers , even wood and stone .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and pining of soul ;
these are the words of the Covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , besides the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
Moses called to all Israel , and said to them , You have seen all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ;
and we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half @-@ tribe of the Manassites .
that he may establish you this day to himself for a people , and that he may be to you a God , as he spoke to you , and as he swore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreigner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick ;
then men shall say , " Because they forsook the Covenant of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Yahweh your God has driven you ,
and shall return to Yahweh your God , and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your soul ;
that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity , and have compassion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yahweh your God has scattered you .
Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart , and the heart of your seed , to love Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , that you may live .
if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law ; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul .
neither is it beyond the sea , that you should say , " Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it to us , and make us to hear it , that we may do it ? "
I denounce to you this day , that you shall surely perish ; you shall not prolong your days in the land , where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it .
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yahweh has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi , who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and to all the elders of Israel .
assemble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreigner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Yahweh your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
and that their children , who have not known , may hear , and learn to fear Yahweh your God , as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it . "
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers , flowing with milk and honey , and they shall have eaten and filled themselves , and grown fat ; then will they turn to other gods , and serve them , and despise me , and break my Covenant .
it happened , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
when the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the children of men , he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel .
he made him ride on the high places of the earth . he ate the increase of the field . he caused him to suck honey out of the rock , oil out of the flinty rock ;
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God . they have provoked me to anger with their vanities . I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people . I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
I will make my arrows drunk with blood . my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives , from the head of the leaders of the enemy . "
" go up into this mountain of Abarim , to Mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and see the land of Canaan , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
and die on the mountain where you go up , and be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor , and was gathered to his people :
because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because you didn 't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel .
who said of his father , and of his mother , ' I have not seen him ; ' Neither did he acknowledge his brothers , Nor did he know his own children : for they have observed your word , and keep your Covenant .
they shall call the peoples to the mountain . there they will offer sacrifices of righteousness , for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas , the hidden treasures of the sand . "
Yahweh said to him , " This is the land which I swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , ' I will give it to your seed . ' I have caused you to see it with your eyes , but you shall not go over there . "
from the wilderness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth , but you shall meditate on it day and night , that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then you shall make your way prosperous , and then you shall have good success .
it happened about the time of the shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don 't know . pursue them quickly ; for you will overtake them . "
as soon as we had heard it , our hearts melted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yahweh your God , he is God in heaven above , and on earth beneath .
then she let them down by a cord through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
behold , when we come into the land , you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you used to let us down . you shall gather to yourself into the house your father , your mother , your brothers , and all your father 's household .
and they commanded the people , saying , " When you see the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh your God , and the priests the Levites bearing it , then you shall move from your place , and follow it .
you shall command the priests who bear the Ark of the Covenant , saying , ' When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan , you shall stand still in the Jordan . ' "
Joshua said , " Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Hivite , and the Perizzite , and the Girgashite , and the Amorite , and the Jebusite out from before you .
and when those who bore the Ark had come to the Jordan , and the feet of the priests who bore the Ark had dipped in the edge of the water ( for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest ) ,
it happened , when all the people had completely passed over , that the Ark of Yahweh passed over , with the priests , in the presence of the people .
it happened , when the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan , and the soles of the priests ' feet were lifted up to the dry ground , that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place , and went over all its banks , as before .
for Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until you had passed over , as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea , which he dried up from before us , until we had passed over ;
this is the reason Joshua circumcised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
the manna ceased on the next day , after they had eaten of the produce of the land . the children of Israel didn 't have manna any more ; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns before Yahweh advanced , and blew the trumpets ; and the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh followed them .
it happened on the seventh day , that they rose early at the dawning of the day , and marched around the city in the same way seven times . only on this day they marched around the city seven times .
the city shall be devoted , even it and all that is in it , to Yahweh . only Rahab the prostitute shall live , she and all who are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
but as for you , only keep yourselves from the devoted thing , lest when you have devoted it , you take of the devoted thing ; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed , and trouble it .
the young men who were spies went in , and brought out Rahab with her father , her mother , her brothers , and all that she had . they also brought out all her relatives , and they set them outside of the camp of Israel .
they burnt the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh 's house .
but Rahab the prostitute , her father 's household , and all that she had , Joshua saved alive . she lived in the midst of Israel to this day , because she hid the messengers , whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things ; for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , took some of the devoted things . therefore Yahweh 's anger burned against the children of Israel .
Joshua sent men from Jericho to AI , which is beside Beth Aven , on the east side of Bethel , and spoke to them , saying , " Go up and spy out the land . " the men went up and spied out AI .
Joshua said , " Alas , Lord Yahweh , why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to cause us to perish ? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan !
it shall be , that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire , he and all that he has , because he has transgressed the Covenant of Yahweh , and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel . ' "
he brought near his household man by man , and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was selected .
they took them from the middle of the tent , and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel . they laid them down before Yahweh .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up to AI . Joshua chose thirty thousand men , the mighty men of valor , and sent them out by night .
I , and all the people who are with me , will approach to the city . it shall happen , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yahweh . behold , I have commanded you . "
all the people , even the men of war who were with him , went up , and drew near , and came before the city , and encamped on the north side of AI . now there was a valley between him and AI .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their ambush on the west of the city ; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hurried and set the city on fire .
the others came out of the city against them , so they were in the midst of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side . they struck them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
it happened , when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of AI in the field , in the wilderness in which they pursued them , and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all Israel returned to AI , and struck it with the edge of the sword .
it happened , when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan , in the hill country , and in the lowland , and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite , heard of it
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and has become moldy .
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a Covenant with them , that they heard that they were their neighbors , and that they lived among them .
therefore the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their armies , and encamped against Gibeon , and made war against it .
it happened , when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed , and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities ,
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
Joshua took Makkedah on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with its king . he utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining . he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho .
Yahweh delivered it also , with its king , into the hand of Israel . he struck it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining in it . he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho .
Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel . he took it on the second day , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with all the souls who were in it , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword . he utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
they took it , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with its king and all its cities , and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but he utterly destroyed it , and all the souls who were in it .
it happened , when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , to the king of Shimron , to the king of Achshaph ,
and to the kings who were on the north , in the hill country , in the Arabah south of Chinneroth , in the lowland , and in the heights of Dor on the west ,
to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the hill country , and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah .
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded .
the children of Israel took all the spoil of these cities , with the livestock , as spoils for themselves ; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them . they didn 't leave any who breathed .
for it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts , to come against Israel in battle , that he might utterly destroy them , that they might have no favor , but that he might destroy them , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
Joshua came at that time , and cut off the Anakim from the hill country , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the hill country of Judah , and from all the hill country of Israel : Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities .
now these are the kings of the land , whom the children of Israel struck , and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon , and all the Arabah eastward :
from Aroer , that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the middle of the valley , and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon ;
their border was from Aroer , that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the middle of the valley , and all the plain by Medeba ;
Moses gave an inheritance to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh . it was for the half @-@ tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families .
these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , Joshua the son of nun , and the heads of the fathers ' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel , distributed to them ,
" now , behold , Yahweh has kept me alive , as he spoke , these forty @-@ five years , from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses , while Israel walked in the wilderness . now , behold , I am eighty @-@ five years old , today .
as yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now for war , to go out and to come in .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom , even to the wilderness of Zin southward , at the uttermost part of the south .
and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea , and passed along by Hezron , went up to Addar , and turned about to Karka ;
the border went up to Beth Hoglah , and passed along by the north of Beth Arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben .
the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor , and so northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is over against the ascent of Adummim , which is on the south side of the river . the border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh , and ended at En Rogel .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron ; and the border extended to Baalah ( the same is Kiriath Jearim ) ;
and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir , and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north ( the same is Chesalon ) , and went down to Beth Shemesh , and passed along by Timnah ;
and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward ; and the border extended to Shikkeron , and passed along to Mount Baalah , and went out at Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah , according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua , even Kiriath Arba , named after the father of Anak ( the same is Hebron ) .
from Tappuah the border went along westward to the Brook of Kanah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families ;
together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh , for he was the firstborn of Joseph . as for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead , because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
so this was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families : for the children of Abiezer , for the children of Helek , for the children of Asriel , for the children of Shechem , for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida : these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families .
but Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters : Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
the border went down to the Brook of Kanah , southward of the Brook . these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh . the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the Brook , and ended at the sea .
Manasseh had three heights in Issachar , in Asher Beth Shean and its towns , and Ibleam and its towns , and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns , and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns , and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and didn 't utterly drive them out .
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
they shall divide it into seven portions . Judah shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north , and went up through the hill country westward . it ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven .
the border passed along from there to Luz , to the side of Luz ( the same is Bethel ) , southward . the border went down to Ataroth Addar , by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Horon the lower .
the border extended , and turned around on the west quarter southward , from the mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward ; and ended at Kiriath Baal ( the same is Kiriath Jearim ) , a city of the children of Judah . this was the west quarter .
the south quarter was from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim . the border went out westward , and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah .
it extended northward , went out at En Shemesh , and went out to Geliloth , which is over against the ascent of Adummim . it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben .
the border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward ; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea , at the south end of the Jordan . this was the south border .
the second lot came out for Simeon , even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families . their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Judah .
out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon ; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them . therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance .
it turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon , and reached to Zebulun , and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth Emek and Neiel . it went out to Cabul on the left hand ,
the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites . the children of Aaron the priest , who were of the Levites , had thirteen cities by lot out of the tribe of Judah , out of the tribe of the Simeonites , and out of the tribe of Benjamin .
the rest of the children of Kohath had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh .
the children of Gershon had thirteen cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar , out of the tribe of Asher , out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh in Bashan .
the children of Merari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Reuben , out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun .
they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are mentioned by name :
and they were for the children of Aaron , of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi ; for theirs was the first lot .
the families of the children of Kohath , the Levites , even the rest of the children of Kohath , had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim .
they gave to the children of Gershon , of the families of the Levites , out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh Golan in Bashan with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and Be Eshterah with its suburbs ; two cities .
to the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with its suburbs , Kartah with its suburbs ,
now to the one half @-@ tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan ; but to the other half gave Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward . moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents , he blessed them ,
when they came to the region about the Jordan , that is in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan , a great altar to look at .
the children of Israel heard this , " behold , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan , in the region about the Jordan , on the side that pertains to the children of Israel . "
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up against them to war .
the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
and with him ten princes , one prince of a fathers ' house for each of the tribes of Israel ; and they were everyone of them head of their fathers ' houses among the thousands of Israel .
they came to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , to the land of Gilead , and they spoke with them , saying ,
" thus says the whole Congregation of Yahweh , ' What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following Yahweh , in that you have built yourselves an altar , to rebel this day against Yahweh ?
then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh answered , and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh ; or if to offer burnt offering or meal offering , or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings , let Yahweh himself require it .
" if we have not out of concern done this , and for a reason , saying , ' In time to come your children might speak to our children , saying , " What have you to do with Yahweh , the God of Israel ?
when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the Congregation , even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke , it pleased them well .
Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , to the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
" therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses , that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left ;
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
when they cried out to Yahweh , he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea on them , and covered them ; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt : and you lived in the wilderness many days .
" ' I brought you into the land of the Amorites , that lived beyond the Jordan : and they fought with you ; and I gave them into your hand . you possessed their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
" ' you went over the Jordan , and came to Jericho . the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorite , the Perizzite , the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Girgashite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite ; and I delivered them into your hand .
I sent the hornet before you , which drove them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; not with your sword , nor with your bow .
the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem , and took it , and struck it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
the children of the Kenite , Moses ' brother @-@ in @-@ law , went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah , which is in the south of Arad ; and they went and lived with the people .
he showed them the entrance into the city ; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let the man go and all his family .
Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns , nor Taanach and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
Naphtali didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh , nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath ; but he lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor .
but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres , in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became subject to forced labor .
the angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim . he said , " I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers ; and I said , ' I will never break my Covenant with you :
it happened , when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
and they forsook Yahweh , the God of their fathers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the peoples who were around them , and bowed themselves down to them : and they provoked Yahweh to anger .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them ; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all around , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
yet they didn 't listen to their judges ; for they played the prostitute after other gods , and bowed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked , obeying the commandments of Yahweh . they didn 't do so .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
but when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised them up a Savior , Ehud the son of Gera , the Benjamite , a man left @-@ handed . the children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab .
now when he was gone out , his servants came ; and they saw , and behold , the doors of the upper room were locked ; and they said , " surely he is covering his feet in the upper room . "
they waited until they were ashamed ; and behold , he didn 't open the doors of the upper room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
it happened , when he had come , that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim ; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he before them .
now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites , even from the children of Hobab the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Moses , and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim , which is by Kedesh .
Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles , to the river Kishon .
but Barak pursued after the chariots , and after the army , to Harosheth of the Gentiles : and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword ; there was not a man left .
however Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite ; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said to him , " Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; don 't be afraid . " he came in to her into the tent , and she covered him with a rug .
he said to her , " Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man comes and inquires of you , and says , ' Is there any man here ? ' that you shall say , ' No . ' "
far from the noise of archers , in the places of drawing water , there they will rehearse the righteous acts of Yahweh , the righteous acts of his rule in Israel . " then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates .
those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim , after you , Benjamin , among your peoples . governors come down out of Machir . those who handle the marshal 's staff came out of Zebulun .
she put her hand to the tent peg , and her right hand to the workmen 's hammer . with the hammer she struck Sisera . she struck through his head . yes , she pierced and struck through his temples .
" so let all your enemies perish , Yahweh , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest forty years .
the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel ; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and the caves , and the strongholds .
so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east ; they came up against them ;
for they came up with their livestock and their tents ; they came in as locusts for multitude ; both they and their camels were without number : and they came into the land to destroy it .
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all who oppressed you , and drove them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and I said to you , " I am Yahweh your God ; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you dwell . " but you have not listened to my voice . ' "
the angel of Yahweh came , and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite : and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
Gideon went in , and prepared a young goat , and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal . he put the meat in a basket and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out to him under the oak , and presented it .
and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold , in an orderly way , and take the second bull , and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down . "
then Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as Yahweh had spoken to him : and it happened , because he feared his father 's household and the men of the city , so that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was broken down , and the Asherah was cut down that was by it , and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built .
behold , I will put a Fleece of wool on the threshing floor ; if there is dew on the Fleece only , and it is dry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and encamped beside the spring of Harod : and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Yahweh said to Gideon , " Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue , like a dog laps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink . "
and you shall hear what they say ; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp . " then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp .
the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude .
it was so , when Gideon heard the telling of the dream , and its interpretation , that he worshiped ; and he returned into the camp of Israel , and said , " arise ; for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian into your hand ! "
now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their armies with them , about fifteen thousand men , all who were left of all the army of the children of the east ; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword .
it happened , as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and played the prostitute after the Baals , and made Baal Berith their god .
the children of Israel didn 't remember Yahweh their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side ;
Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
his mother 's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , " He is our brother . "
when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said to them , " listen to me , you men of Shechem , that God may listen to you .
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , seventy persons , on one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his female servant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ) ;
the men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
now therefore , go up by night , you and the people who are with you , and lie in wait in the field :
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , you shall rise early , and rush on the city ; and behold , when he and the people who are with him come out against you , then may you do to them as you shall find occasion . "
Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people who were with him , from the ambush .
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and behold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
Abimelech , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
all the people likewise each cut down his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them at the base of the stronghold , and set the stronghold on fire on them ; so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and there fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut themselves in , and went up to the roof of the tower .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and served the Baals , and the Ashtaroth , and the gods of Syria , and the gods of Sidon , and the gods of Moab , and the gods of the children of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines ; and they forsook Yahweh , and didn 't serve him .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the children of Ammon .
the people , the princes of Gilead , said one to another , " What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . "
then Jephthah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah , and they went out with him .
it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob ;
the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , " Therefore we have turned again to you now , that you may go with us , and fight with the children of Ammon ; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . "
while Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns , and in Aroer and its towns , and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon , three hundred years ; why didn 't you recover them within that time ?
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon .
then it shall be , that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , it shall be Yahweh 's , and I will offer it up for a burnt offering . "
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my companions . "
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she was a virgin . it was a custom in Israel ,
the men of Ephraim were gathered together , and passed northward ; and they said to Jephthah , " Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon , and didn 't call us to go with you ? we will burn your house around you with fire ! "
when I saw that you didn 't save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and Yahweh delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
for , behold , you shall conceive , and bear a son ; and no razor shall come on his head ; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb : and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines . "
the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah , " Though you detain me , I won 't eat of your bread ; and if you will prepare a burnt offering , you must offer it to Yahweh . " for Manoah didn 't know that he was the angel of Yahweh .
for it happened , when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar , that the angel of Yahweh ascended in the flame of the altar : and Manoah and his wife looked on ; and they fell on their faces to the ground .
the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him , and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat ; and he had nothing in his hand : but he didn 't tell his father or his mother what he had done .
when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines , and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain , and also the olive groves .
they said to him , " We have come down to bind you , that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines . " Samson said to them , " swear to me that you will not fall on me yourselves . "
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand ; and that place was called Ramath Lehi .
she said , " The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! " he awoke out of his sleep , and said , " I will go out as at other times , and shake myself free . " but he didn 't know that Yahweh had departed from him .
the Philistines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
when the people saw him , they praised their god ; for they said , " Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country , who has slain many of us , into our hand . "
it happened , when their hearts were merry , that they said , " Call for Samson , that he may entertain us . " they called for Samson out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pillars ;
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women , who saw while Samson performed .
when he restored the money to his mother , his mother took two hundred pieces of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made of it an engraved image and a molten image : and it was in the house of Micah .
the man departed out of the city , out of Bethlehem Judah , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he traveled .
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in ; for to that day , their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel .
they said , " arise , and let us go up against them ; for we have seen the land , and behold , it is very good . do you stand still ? Don 't be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land .
the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
when they were a good way from the house of Micah , the men who were in the houses near to Micah 's house were gathered together , and overtook the children of Dan .
the children of Dan said to him , " Don 't let your voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows fall on you , and you lose your life , with the lives of your household . "
they took that which Micah had made , and the priest whom he had , and came to Laish , to a people quiet and secure , and struck them with the edge of the sword ; and they burnt the city with fire .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was Laish at the first .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land .
it happened in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Levite living on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim , who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah .
it happened on the fourth day , that they arose early in the morning , and he rose up to depart : and the young lady 's father said to his son @-@ in @-@ law , " Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward you shall go your way . "
so they sat down , ate , and drank , both of them together : and the young lady 's father said to the man , " Please be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be merry . "
but the man wouldn 't stay that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus ( the same is Jerusalem ) : and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled ; his concubine also was with him .
when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said to his master , " Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it . "
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gibeah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim , and he lived in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjamites .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city ; and the old man said , " Where are you going ? where did you come from ? "
yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for your handmaid , and for the young man who is with your servants : there is no want of anything . "
her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
he said to her , " Get up , and let us be going ! " but no one answered . then he took her up on the donkey ; and the man rose up , and went to his place .
when he had come into his house , he took a knife , and laid hold on his concubine , and divided her , limb by limb , into twelve pieces , and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel .
now therefore deliver up the men , the base fellows , who are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel . " but Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel .
the children of Israel arose , and went up to Bethel , and asked counsel of God ; and they said , " Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin ? " Yahweh said , " Judah first . "
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah .
the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves , and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came to Bethel , and wept , and sat there before Yahweh , and fasted that day until evening ; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah .
but when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them ; and behold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst .
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the sword , both the entire city , and the livestock , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
they said , " behold , there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh , which is on the north of Bethel , on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah . "
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel departed there at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .
then she arose with her daughters @-@ in @-@ law , that she might return from the country of Moab : for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters @-@ in @-@ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah .
go back , my daughters , go your way ; for I am too old to have a husband . if I should say , ' I have hope , ' if I should even have a husband tonight , and should also bear sons ;
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @-@ in @-@ law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed .
now , my daughter , don 't be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman .
Boaz said to the elders , and to all the people , " You are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech 's , and all that was Chilion 's and Mahlon 's , from the hand of Naomi .
now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim , of the hill country of Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephraimite :
when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bulls , and one ephah of meal , and a bottle of wine , and brought him to Yahweh 's house in Shiloh . the child was young .
those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces . he will Thunder against them in the sky . " Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth . he will give strength to his king , and exalt the Horn of his anointed . "
now Eli was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of Meeting .
behold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my anointed forever .
it happened at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place ( now his eyes had begun to grow dim , so that he could not see ) ,
so the people sent to Shiloh ; and they brought from there the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh of Armies , who sits above the cherubim : and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there with the Ark of the Covenant of God .
when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , " What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean ? " they understood that the Ark of Yahweh had come into the camp .
about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her , " Don 't be afraid ; for you have given birth to a son . " but she didn 't answer , neither did she regard it .
when they of Ashdod arose early on the next day , behold , Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the Ark of Yahweh . they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
it was so , that after they had carried it about , the hand of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion : and he struck the men of the city , both small and great ; and tumors broke out on them .
therefore you shall make images of your tumors , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
the cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh ; they went along the highway , lowing as they went , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh .
they of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley ; and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ark , and rejoiced to see it .
the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they split the wood of the cart , and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
the Levites took down the Ark of Yahweh , and the coffer that was with it , in which the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh .
when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don 't cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines . "
Yahweh said to Samuel , " listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and they shall run before his chariots ;
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your donkeys , and put them to his work .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Becorath , the son of Aphiah , the son of a Benjamite , a mighty man of valor .
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
when they had come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant who was with him , " Come , and let us return , lest my father stop caring about the donkeys , and be anxious for us . "
( in earlier times in Israel , when a man went to inquire of God , thus he said , " Come , and let us go to the seer " ; for he who is now called a prophet was before called a Seer . )
as for your donkeys who were lost three days ago , don 't set your mind on them ; for they are found . for whom is all that is desirable in Israel ? is it not for you , and for all your father 's house ? "
they arose early : and it happened about the spring of the day , that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop , saying , " Get up , that I may send you away . " Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
it happened , when all who knew him before saw that , behold , he prophesied with the prophets , then the people said one to another , " What is this that has come to the son of Kish ? is Saul also among the prophets ? "
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yahweh . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul , and spoke these words in the ears of the people : and all the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
they said to the messengers who came , " Thus you shall tell the men of Jabesh Gilead , ' Tomorrow , by the time the sun is hot , you shall have deliverance . ' " the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh ; and they were glad .
" but they forgot Yahweh their God ; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the army of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab ; and they fought against them .
they cried to Yahweh , and said , ' We have sinned , because we have forsaken Yahweh , and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve you . '
the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand chariots , and six thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude : and they came up , and encamped in Michmash , eastward of Beth Aven .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in coverts , and in pits .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might greet him .
but now your kingdom shall not continue . Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart , and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people , because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you . "
the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah , to the land of Shual ;
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
now it fell on a day , that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor , " Come , and let us go over to the Philistines ' garrison , that is on the other side . " but he didn 't tell his father .
between the passes , by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines ' garrison , there was a rocky crag on the one side , and a rocky crag on the other side : and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armor bearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were half a furrow 's length in an acre of land .
Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together , and came to the battle : and behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow : a very great confusion .
now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
but Jonathan didn 't hear when his father commanded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand , and dipped it in the honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
and the people flew on the spoil , and took sheep , and cattle , and calves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel , he fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines : and wherever he turned himself , he defeated them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishvi , and Malchishua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz . the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
" it grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king ; for he is turned back from following me , and has not performed my commandments . " Samuel was angry ; and he cried to Yahweh all night .
Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning ; and it was told Samuel , saying , " Saul came to Carmel , and behold , he set up a monument for himself , and turned , and passed on , and went down to Gilgal . "
he had a helmet of brass on his head , and he was clad with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Saul , stricken among men .
the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next to him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the ranks of the Philistines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
David said , " Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . " Saul said to David , " Go ; and Yahweh shall be with you . "
he took his staff in his hand , and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the Brook , and put them in the shepherd 's bag which he had , even in his wallet . his sling was in his hand ; and he drew near to the Philistine .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and slung it , and struck the Philistine in his forehead ; and the stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the earth .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and struck the Philistine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
then David ran , and stood over the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of its sheath , and killed him , and cut off his head therewith . when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , they fled .
the men of Israel and of Judah arose , and shouted , and pursued the Philistines , until you come to Gai , and to the gates of Ekron . the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim , even to Gath , and to Ekron .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking to Saul , that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul .
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clothing , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his sash .
it happened on the next day , that an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul , and he prophesied in the midst of the house . David played with his hand , as he did day by day . Saul had his spear in his hand ;
Saul 's servants spoke those words in the ears of David . David said , " Does it seems to you a light thing to be the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law , since I am a poor man , and lightly esteemed ? "
then the princes of the Philistines went forth : and it happened , as often as they went forth , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul ; so that his name was highly esteemed .
Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he stuck the spear into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
Saul sent messengers to David 's house , to watch him , and to kill him in the morning . Michal , David 's wife , told him , saying , " If you don 't save your life tonight , tomorrow you will be killed . "
therefore deal kindly with your servant ; for you have brought your servant into a Covenant of Yahweh with you : but if there is iniquity in me , kill me yourself ; for why should you bring me to your father ? "
but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever ; no , not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth . "
when you have stayed three days , you shall go down quickly , and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started , and shall remain by the stone Ezel .
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jonathan stood up , and Abner sat by Saul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and ate no food the second day of the month ; for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
as soon as the boy was gone , David arose out of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times . they kissed one another , and wept one with another , and David wept the most .
now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before Yahweh ; and his name was Doeg the Edomite , the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul .
the servants of Achish said to him , " Isn 't this David the king of the land ? Didn 't they sing one to another about him in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
everyone who was in distress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was discontented , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
Saul heard that David was discovered , and the men who were with him . now Saul was sitting in Gibeah , under the tamarisk tree in Ramah , with his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him .
he struck Nob , the city of the priests , with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and nursing babies , and cattle and donkeys and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
then David and his men , who were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Keilah , and went wherever they could go . it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah ; and he gave up going there .
then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah , saying , " Doesn 't David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of the desert ?
now therefore , O king , come down , according to all the desire of your soul to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king 's hand . "
Saul and his men went to seek him . when David was told , he went down to the rock , and stayed in the wilderness of Maon . when Saul heard that , he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon .
Saul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul ; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them .
it happened , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , " behold , David is in the wilderness of En Gedi . "
so David checked his men with these words , and didn 't allow them to rise against Saul . Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
David also arose afterward , and went out of the cave , and cried after Saul , saying , " My lord the king ! " when Saul looked behind him , David bowed with his face to the earth , and showed respect .
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul , that Saul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
swear now therefore to me by Yahweh , that you will not cut off my seed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was Shearing his sheep in Carmel .
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
now I have heard that you have shearers . your shepherds have now been with us , and we didn 't hurt them , neither was there anything missing from them , all the while they were in Carmel .
ask your young men , and they will tell you . therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes ; for we come in a good day . please give whatever comes to your hand , to your servants , and to your son David . ' "
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my meat that I have killed for my shearers , and give it to men who I don 't know where they come from ? "
it was so , as she rode on her donkey , and came down by the covert of the mountain , that behold , David and his men came down toward her ; and she met them .
please forgive the trespass of your handmaid . for Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house , because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh ; and evil shall not be found in you all your days .
though men may rise up to pursue you , and to seek your soul , yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God . he will sling out the souls of your enemies , as from the hollow of a sling .
it shall come to pass , when Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you , and shall have appointed you prince over Israel ,
that this shall be no grief to you , nor offense of heart to my lord , either that you have shed blood without cause , or that my lord has avenged himself . when Yahweh has dealt well with my lord , then remember your handmaid . "
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " Go up in peace to your house . behold , I have listened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
Abigail came to Nabal ; and behold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king . Nabal 's heart was merry within him , for he was very drunken . therefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah , which is before the desert , by the way . but David stayed in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
David arose , and came to the place where Saul had encamped ; and David saw the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his army : and Saul lay within the place of the wagons , and the people were encamped around him .
so David and Abishai came to the people by night : and , behold , Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons , with his spear stuck in the ground at his head ; and Abner and the people lay around him .
now therefore , don 't let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh ; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea , as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains . "
David lived with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife .
David struck the land , and saved neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the cattle , and the donkeys , and the camels , and the clothing ; and he returned , and came to Achish .
it happened in those days , that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . Achish said to David , " Know assuredly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
the woman said to him , " behold , you know what Saul has done , how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land . why then do you lay a snare for my life , to cause me to die ? "
Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me . Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand , and given it to your neighbor , even to David .
then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth , and was terrified , because of the words of Samuel . there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
the woman came to Saul , and saw that he was very troubled , and said to him , " behold , your handmaid has listened to your voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have listened to your words which you spoke to me .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , depart . "
it happened , when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South , and on Ziklag , and had struck Ziklag , and burned it with fire ,
when David and his men came to the city , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captive .
then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
they gave him a piece of a cake of figs , and two clusters of raisins. when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him ; for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who rode on camels and fled .
who will listen to you in this matter ? for as his share is who goes down to the battle , so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage : they shall share alike . "
and to those who were in Racal , and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites , and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites ,
all the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan ; and they came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
it happened on the third day , that behold , a man came out of the camp from Saul , with his clothes torn , and earth on his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the earth , and showed respect .
David said to him , " How did it go ? please tell me . " he answered , " The people have fled from the battle , and many of the people also have fallen and are dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also . "
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa , behold , Saul was leaning on his spear ; and behold , the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him .
they mourned , and wept , and fasted until evening , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Yahweh , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
( and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jashar ) :
the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . they told David , saying , " The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul . "
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead , and said to them , " blessed are you by Yahweh , that you have shown this kindness to your lord , even to Saul , and have buried him .
Joab the son of Zeruiah , and the servants of David , went out , and met them by the pool of Gibeon ; and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
Asahel pursued after Abner ; and in going he didn 't turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
now then do it ; for Yahweh has spoken of David , saying , ' By the hand of my servant David , I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines , and out of the hand of all their enemies . ' "
Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
when Joab and all the army who was with him had come , they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he has sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
your hands were not bound , nor your feet put into fetters . as a man falls before the children of iniquity , so you fell . " all the people wept again over him .
in times past , when Saul was king over us , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yahweh said to you , ' You shall be shepherd of my people Israel , and you shall be prince over Israel . ' "
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall stir yourself up ; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
so David would not move the Ark of Yahweh to be with him in the city of David ; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
it was so , as the Ark of Yahweh came into the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh ; and she despised him in her heart .
they brought in the Ark of Yahweh , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
he gave to all the people , even among the whole multitude of Israel , both to men and women , to everyone a portion of bread , dates , and raisins . so all the people departed everyone to his house .
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle .
I have been with you wherever you went , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a great name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sleep with your fathers , I will set up your seed after you , who shall proceed out of your bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
he struck Moab , and measured them with the line , making them to lie down on the ground ; and he measured two lines to put to death , and one full line to keep alive . the Moabites became servants to David , and brought tribute .
then Ziba said to the king , " According to all that my lord the king commands his servant , so your shall servant do . " so Mephibosheth ate at the king 's table , like one of the king 's sons .
when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David , the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob , and the Syrians of Zobah , twenty thousand footmen , and the king of Maacah with one thousand men , and the men of Tob twelve thousand men .
the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate : and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob , and the men of Tob and Maacah , were by themselves in the field .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians :
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai , and entered into the city . then Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
it happened at evening , that David arose from off his bed , and walked on the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he saw a woman bathing ; and the woman was very beautiful to look on .
when they had told David , saying , " Uriah didn 't go down to his house , " David said to Uriah , " haven 't you come from a journey ? why didn 't you go down to your house ? "
when David had called him , he ate and drink before him ; and he made him drunk . at evening , he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but didn 't go down to his house .
it shall be that , if the king 's wrath arise , and he asks you , ' Why did you go so near to the city to fight ? Didn 't you know that they would shoot from the wall ?
I gave you your master 's house , and your master 's wives into your bosom , and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that would have been too little , I would have added to you many more such things .
why have you despised the word of Yahweh , to do that which is evil in his sight ? you have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and have taken his wife to be your wife , and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon .
" this is what Yahweh says : ' behold , I will raise up evil against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wives before your eyes , and give them to your neighbor , and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun .
he took the crown of their king from off his head ; and its weight was a talent of gold , and in it were precious stones ; and it was set on David 's head . he brought out the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
so Amnon lay down and faked being sick . when the king came to see him , Amnon said to the king , " Please let my sister Tamar come , and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat from her hand . "
so Tamar went to her brother Amnon 's house ; and he was laid down . she took dough , and kneaded it , and made cakes in his sight , and baked the cakes .
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were virgins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
Tamar put ashes on her head , and tore her garment of various colors that was on her ; and she laid her hand on her head , and went her way , crying aloud as she went .
the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man got up on his mule , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Absalom has slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
but Absalom fled . the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold , many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him .
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and wept . the king also and all his servants wept bitterly .
now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and your handmaid said , ' I will now speak to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant . '
then your handmaid said , ' Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest ; for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad . May Yahweh , your God , be with you . ' "
Joab fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and blessed the king . Joab said , " Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight , my lord , king , in that the king has performed the request of his servant . "
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
when he cut the hair of his head ( now it was at every year 's end that he cut it ; because it was heavy on him , therefore he cut it ) ; he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels , after the king 's weight .
all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , six hundred men who came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Brook Kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
behold , Zadok also came , and all the Levites with him , bearing the Ark of the Covenant of God ; and they set down the Ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people finished passing out of the city .
David went up by the ascent of the Mount of olives , and wept as he went up ; and he had his head covered , and went barefoot : and all the people who were with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
it happened that when David had come to the top , where God was worshiped , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn , and earth on his head .
Don 't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you ? therefore it shall be , that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king 's house , you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz , Zadok 's son , and Jonathan , Abiathar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
when king David came to Bahurim , behold , a man of the family of the house of Saul came out , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera . he came out , and Cursed still as he came .
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
even he who is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will utterly melt ; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man , and those who are with him are valiant men .
so shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground ; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there isn 't one small stone found there . "
Absalom and all the men of Israel said , " The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel . " for Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel , to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom .
then David arose , and all the people who were with him , and they passed over the Jordan . by the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan .
when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his donkey , and arose , and went home , to his city , and set his house in order , and hanged himself ; and he died , and was buried in the tomb of his father .
Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab . now Amasa was the son of a man , whose name was Ithra the Israelite , who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah , Joab 's mother .
then Joab said , " I 'm not going to wait like this with you . " he took three darts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Absalom , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
Joab came into the house to the king , and said , " You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants , who this day have saved your life , and the lives of your sons and of your daughters , and the lives of your wives , and the lives of your concubines ;
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
for your servant knows that I have sinned . therefore behold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king . "
Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king ; and he had neither groomed his feet , nor trimmed his beard , nor washed his clothes , from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace .
there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men ; and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
but the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of Yahweh 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
but the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bore to Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite .
he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites , and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh , and all seven of them fell together . they were put to death in the days of harvest , in the first days , at the beginning of barley harvest .
they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela , in the tomb of Kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . after that God was entreated for the land .
David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
in my distress I called on Yahweh . yes , I called to my God . he heard my voice out of his temple . my cry came into his ears .
you also have delivered me from the strivings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
who brings me away from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun rises , a morning without clouds , when the tender grass springs out of the earth , through clear shining after rain . '
after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite . the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of lentils ; and the people fled from the Philistines .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam ; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but he would not drink of it , but poured it out to Yahweh .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
he killed an Egyptian , a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and killed him with his own spear .
the king said to Joab the captain of the army , who was with him , " Now go back and forth through all the tribes of Israel , from Dan even to Beersheba , and number the people , that I may know the sum of the people . "
notwithstanding , the king 's word prevailed against Joab , and against the captains of the army . Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
therefore his servants said to him , " Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin . let her stand before the king , and cherish him ; and let her lie in your bosom , that my lord the king may keep warm . "
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men who belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
go in to king David , and tell him , ' Didn 't you , my lord , king , swear to your handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ? why then does Adonijah reign ? '
he has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the army ; but he hasn 't called Solomon your servant .
they told the king , saying , " behold , Nathan the prophet ! " when he had come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh , the God of Israel , saying , ' Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne in my place ; ' most certainly so will I do this day . "
then you shall come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my throne ; for he shall be king in my place . I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah . "
so Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
the king has sent with him Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and they have caused him to ride on the king 's mule .
moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , ' May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and make his throne greater than your throne ; ' and the king bowed himself on the bed .
also thus said the king , ' blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , who has given one to sit on my throne this day , my eyes even seeing it . ' "
so shall their blood return on the head of Joab , and on the head of his seed forever . but to David , and to his seed , and to his house , and to his throne , there shall be peace forever from Yahweh . "
for on the day you go out , and pass over the Brook Kidron , know for certain that you shall surely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
it happened at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish , son of Maacah , king of Gath . they told Shimei , saying , " behold , your servants are in Gath . "
so the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he went out , and fell on him , so that he died . the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon .
I have also given you that which you have not asked , both riches and honor , so that there shall not be any among the kings like you , all your days .
it happened the third day after I delivered , that this woman delivered also . we were together . there was no stranger with us in the house , just us two in the house .
when I rose in the morning to nurse my child , behold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , whom I bore . "
then the king said , " The one says , ' This is my son who lives , and your son is the dead ; ' and the other says , ' No ; but your son is the dead one , and my son is the living one . ' "
Ben Geber , in Ramoth Gilead ( to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh , which are in Gilead ; to him belonged the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars ) ;
Geber the son of Uri , in the land of Gilead , the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
for he had dominion over all on this side the River , from Tiphsah even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side the River : and he had peace on all sides around him .
he spoke of trees , from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall ; he spoke also of animals , and of birds , and of creeping things , and of fish .
besides Solomon 's chief officers who were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , who bore rule over the people who labored in the work .
it happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Ziv , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of Yahweh .
against the wall of the house he built stories all around , against the walls of the house all around , both of the temple and of the oracle ; and he made side rooms all around .
the nethermost story was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad ; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around , that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quarry ; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house : and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story , and out of the middle into the third .
" concerning this house which you are building , if you will walk in my statutes , and execute my ordinances , and keep all my commandments to walk in them ; then will I establish my word with you , which I spoke to David your father .
he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar : from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling , he covered them on the inside with wood ; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir .
five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
he set the cherubim within the inner house ; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall ; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house .
so he made two doors of olive wood ; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers , and overlaid them with gold ; and he spread the gold on the cherubim , and on the palm trees .
in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all its parts , and according to all its fashion . so was he seven years in building it .
his house where he was to dwell , the other court within the porch , was of the like work . he made also a house for Pharaoh 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this porch .
he made two capitals of molten brass , to set on the tops of the pillars : the height of the one capital was five cubits , and the height of the other capital was five cubits .
there were nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ; seven for the one capital , and seven for the other capital .
there were capitals above also on the two pillars , close by the belly which was beside the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred , in rows around on the other capital .
he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called its name Jachin ; and he set up the left pillar , and called its name Boaz .
it stood on twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
the four wheels were underneath the panels ; and the axles of the wheels were in the base : and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit .
the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their axles , and their rims , and their spokes , and their naves , were all molten .
he set the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward , toward the south .
the two pillars , and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ;
and the cups , and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the fire pans , of pure gold ; and the hinges , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , of the temple , of gold .
thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yahweh was finished . Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated , the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , and put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the princes of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel , to king Solomon in Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David , which is Zion .
they brought up the Ark of Yahweh , and the tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent ; even these the priests and the Levites brought up .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , who were assembled to him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh to its place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubim .
there was nothing in the Ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb , when Yahweh made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
Yahweh has established his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and I sit on the throne of Israel , as Yahweh promised , and have built the house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
there I have set a place for the Ark , in which is the Covenant of Yahweh , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and for his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which you have said , ' My name shall be there ; ' to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place .
listen to the supplication of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place . yes , hear in heaven , your dwelling place ; and when you hear , forgive .
then hear in heaven , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way on his own head , and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you afflict them :
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
then hear in heaven , your dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of all the children of men ; )
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
( for they shall hear of your great name , and of your mighty hand , and of your outstretched arm ) ; when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
" if your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name ;
if they sin against you ( for there is no man who doesn 't sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy , far off or near ;
yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive , saying , ' We have sinned , and have done perversely ; we have dealt wickedly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies , who carried them captive , and pray to you toward their land , which you gave to their fathers , the city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name :
and forgive your people who have sinned against you , and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you ; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh , he arose from before the altar of Yahweh , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven .
" blessed be Yahweh , who has given rest to his people Israel , according to all that he promised . there has not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by Moses his servant .
that he may incline our hearts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his ordinances , which he commanded our fathers .
let these my words , with which I have made supplication before Yahweh , be near to Yahweh our God day and night , that he may maintain the cause of his servant , and the cause of his people Israel , as every day shall require ;
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
as for you , if you will walk before me , as David your father walked , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel . '
but if you turn away from following me , you or your children , and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you , but shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and the cities for his chariots , and the cities for his horsemen , and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people who were left of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
she came to Jerusalem with a very great train , with camels that bore spices , and very much gold , and precious stones ; and when she had come to Solomon , she talked with him of all that was in her heart .
besides that which the traders brought , and the traffic of the merchants , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the governors of the country .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and a horse for one hundred fifty ; and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
therefore Yahweh said to Solomon , " Because this is done by you , and you have not kept my Covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded you , I will surely tear the kingdom from you , and will give it to your servant .
however I will not tear away all the kingdom ; but I will give one tribe to your son , for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen . "
that Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt , Hadad being yet a little child .
they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran ; and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , to Pharaoh king of Egypt , who gave him a house , and appointed him food , and gave him land .
when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the army was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , " Let me depart , that I may go to my own country . "
it happened at that time , when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
( but he shall have one tribe , for my servant David 's sake and for Jerusalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel ) ;
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , aren 't they written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam lived in Egypt ,
they spoke to him , saying , " If you will be a servant to this people this day , and will serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Thus you shall tell this people who spoke to you , saying , ' Your father made our yoke heavy , but make it lighter to us ; ' you shall say to them , ' My little finger is thicker than my father 's waist .
so the king didn 't listen to the people ; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh , that he might establish his word , which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
it happened , when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned , that they sent and called him to the Congregation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none who followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only .
if this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord , even to Rehoboam king of Judah ; and they will kill me , and return to Rehoboam king of Judah . "
now there lived an old prophet in Bethel ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah , saying , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Because you have been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh , and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you ,
but came back , and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you , " eat no bread , and drink no water " ; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers . ' "
it happened , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the donkey stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
behold , men passed by , and saw the body cast in the way , and the lion standing by the body ; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived .
the prophet took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the donkey , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn , and to bury him .
it happened , after he had buried him , that he spoke to his sons , saying , " When I am dead , then bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried . lay my bones beside his bones .
for the saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against the altar in Bethel , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria , will surely happen . "
Jeroboam 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . now Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
and tore the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it you ; and yet you have not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in my eyes ,
but have done evil above all who were before you , and have gone and made you other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and have cast me behind your back :
he who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Yahweh has spoken it . " '
the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed , above all that their fathers had done .
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and didn 't turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .

Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon .
for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger .
now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
" because I exalted you out of the dust , and made you prince over my people Israel , and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam , and have made my people Israel to sin , to provoke me to anger with their sins ;
the dogs will eat Baasha 's descendants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
it happened , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he struck all the house of Baasha : he didn 't leave him a single one who urinates on a wall , neither of his relatives , nor of his friends .
now the rest of the acts of Elah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
the people who were encamped heard say , Zimri has conspired , and has also struck the king : therefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the army , king over Israel that day in the camp .
it happened , when Zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the castle of the king 's house , and burnt the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his treason that he committed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?

now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he showed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the thirty @-@ eighth year of ASA king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel : and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty @-@ two years .
it happened , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians , and went and served Baal , and worshiped him .
Elijah said to her , " Don 't be afraid . go and do as you have said ; but make me of it a little cake first , and bring it out to me , and afterward make some for you and for your son .
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' The jar of meal shall not empty , neither shall the jar of oil fail , until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth . ' "
it happened after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so severe , that there was no breath left in him .
Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Elijah said , " behold , your son lives . "
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh , that Obadiah took one hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
it was so , when midday was past , that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
he put the wood in order , and cut the bull in pieces , and laid it on the wood . he said , " fill four jars with water , and pour it on the burnt offering , and on the wood . "
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he bowed himself down on the earth , and put his face between his knees .
when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Beersheba , which belongs to Judah , and left his servant there .
it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . behold , a voice came to him , and said , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
it shall happen , that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael , Jehu will kill ; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu , Elisha will kill .
but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time , and they shall search your house , and the houses of your servants ; and it shall be , that whatever is pleasant in your eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away . " ' "

it happened at the return of the year , that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
as your servant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " So your judgment shall be ; you yourself have decided it . "
so she wrote letters in Ahab 's name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city , who lived with Naboth .
the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city , did as Jezebel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
it happened , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
" arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who dwells in Samaria . behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
behold , I will bring evil on you , and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall , and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger , and have made Israel to sin . "
now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " surely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . Jehoshaphat cried out .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a certain man drew his bow at random , and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor . therefore he said to the driver of his chariot , " Turn your hand , and carry me out of the battle ; for I am severely wounded . "
they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves ; according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke .
now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the Ivory house which he built , and all the cities that he built , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
he walked in all the way of ASA his father ; He didn 't turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he showed , and how he warred , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?

but the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite , " arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria , and tell them , ' Is it because there is no God in Israel , that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub , the god of Ekron ?
then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him . he went up to him ; and behold , he was sitting on the top of the hill . he said to him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' Come down ! ' "
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that behold , a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
Elisha saw it , and he cried , " My father , my father , the chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! " he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and tore them in two pieces .
he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and struck the waters , and said , " Where is Yahweh , the God of Elijah ? " when he also had struck the waters , they were divided here and there ; and Elisha went over .
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
he went up from there to Bethel . as he was going up by the way , some youths came out of the city and mocked him , and said to him , " Go up , you baldy ! go up , you baldhead ! "
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom ; and they made a circuit of seven days ' journey . there was no water for the army , nor for the animals that followed them .
for thus says Yahweh , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your livestock and your animals .
now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , they gathered themselves together , all who were able to put on armor , and upward , and stood on the border .
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone on the water , and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood .
when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword , to break through to the king of Edom ; but they could not .
then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place , and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall . there was great wrath against Israel : and they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
it fell on a day , that Elisha passed to Shunem , where there was a prominent woman ; and she persuaded him to eat bread . so it was , that as often as he passed by , he turned in there to eat bread .
please let us make a little room on the wall . let us set for him there a bed , a table , a chair , and a lamp stand . it shall be , when he comes to us , that he shall turn in there . "
he went up , and lay on the child , and put his mouth on his mouth , and his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands . he stretched himself on him ; and the flesh of the child grew warm .
Elisha came again to Gilgal . there was a famine in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him ; and he said to his servant , " Set on the great pot , and boil stew for the sons of the prophets . "
so they poured out for the men to eat . it happened , as they were eating of the stew , that they cried out , and said , " Man of God , there is death in the pot ! " they could not eat of it .
now Naaman , captain of the army of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honorable , because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria : he was also a mighty man of valor , but he was a leper .
someone went in , and told his lord , saying , " The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this . "
he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , " Now when this letter has come to you , behold , I have sent Naaman my servant to you , that you may heal him of his leprosy . "
it was so , when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , " Why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel . "
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they departed .
it happened , when they had come into Samaria , that Elisha said , " Yahweh , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . " Yahweh opened their eyes , and they saw ; and behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
there was a great famine in Samaria . behold , they besieged it , until a donkey 's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a kab of dove 's Dung for five pieces of silver .
it happened , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he tore his clothes ( now he was passing by on the wall ) ; and the people looked , and behold , he had sackcloth underneath on his flesh .
they rose up in the twilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
the woman arose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years .
it happened at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines . then she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land .
it happened on the next day , that he took a thick cloth , dipped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died . then Hazael reigned in his place .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife . he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .

you shall strike the house of Ahab your master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh , at the hand of Jezebel .

it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent them to him to Jezreel .

when he came to Samaria , he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke to Elijah .
Jehu sent through all Israel ; and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that didn 't come . they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another .
however from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin , Jehu didn 't depart from after them , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
but Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh , the God of Israel , with all his heart . he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin .

a third part shall be at the gate Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
you shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he who comes within the ranks , let him be slain . be with the king when he goes out , and when he comes in . "
the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded ; and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sabbath , with those who were to go out on the Sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest .
the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David 's , which were in the house of Yahweh .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " Bring her out between the ranks . kill him who follows her with the sword . " for the priest said , " Don 't let her be slain in the house of Yahweh . "
so they made way for her ; and she went by the way of the horses ' entry to the king 's house . she was slain there .
all the people of the land went to the house of Baal , and broke it down ; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . the priest appointed officers over the house of Yahweh .

but it was so , that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
but Jehoiada the priest took a chest , and bored a hole in its lid , and set it beside the altar , on the right side as one comes into the house of Yahweh : and the priests who kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh .
it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king 's scribe and the high priest came up , and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yahweh .
they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work , who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh : and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders , who worked on the house of Yahweh ,
and to the masons and the stone cutters , and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Yahweh , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
but there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups of silver , snuffers , basins , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh ;

but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel .
so Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria , saying , " I am your servant and your son . come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , who rise up against me . "

in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away to Assyria , and placed them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city ;
notwithstanding , they would not listen , but hardened their neck , like the neck of their fathers , who didn 't believe in Yahweh their God .
they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon , and from Cuthah , and from Avva , and from Hamath and Sepharvaim , and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel ; and they possessed Samaria , and lived in the cities of it .
so it was , at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they didn 't fear Yahweh : therefore Yahweh sent lions among them , which killed some of them .
but you shall fear Yahweh , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm , and you shall bow yourselves to him , and you shall sacrifice to him .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah .
he removed the high places , and broke the pillars , and cut down the Asherah : and he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made ; for in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it ; and he called it Nehushtan .
it happened in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria , and put them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ,
at that time , Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh 's temple , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem . they went up and came to Jerusalem . when they had come up , they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool , which is in the highway of the fuller 's field .
you say ( but they are but vain words ) , ' There is counsel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
now , behold , you trust in the staff of this bruised Reed , even in Egypt . if a man leans on it , it will go into his hand , and Pierce it . so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him .
now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , came with Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
they said to him , " Thus says Hezekiah , ' This day is a day of trouble , of rebuke , and of rejection ; for the children have come to the point of birth , and there is no strength to deliver them .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will put a spirit in him , and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "
'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , " Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
have the gods of the nations delivered them , which my fathers have destroyed , Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden that were in Telassar ?
Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh , and said , " Yahweh , the God of Israel , who sit above the cherubim , you are the God , even you alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth . you have made heaven and earth .
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , Yahweh our God , save us , I beg you , out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you , Yahweh , are God alone . "
haven 't you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dismayed and confounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green herb , like the grass on the housetops , and like grain blasted before it has grown up .
because of your raging against me , and because your arrogance has come up into my ears , therefore will I put my hook in your nose , and my bridle in your lips , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came . "
" ' this shall be the sign to you : you shall eat this year that which grows of itself , and in the second year that which springs of the same ; and in the third year sow , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat its fruit .
" therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria , ' He shall not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mound against it .
it happened that night , that the angel of Yahweh went out , and struck one hundred eighty @-@ five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
it happened , before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city , that the word of Yahweh came to him , saying ,
I will add to your days fifteen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . " ' "
'Behold , the days come , that all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day , shall be carried to Babylon . nothing shall be left , ' says Yahweh .
'Of your sons who shall issue from you , whom you shall father , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon . ' "
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and all his might , and how he made the pool , and the conduit , and brought water into the city , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars for Baal , and made an Asherah , as did Ahab king of Israel , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served them .
he made his son to pass through the fire , and practiced sorcery , and used enchantments , and dealt with those who had familiar spirits , and with wizards : he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
because they have done that which is evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Amon was twenty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty @-@ one years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in all the way of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan , the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of Yahweh , saying ,
" go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh , which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , " Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh . "
so Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asaiah , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter ) ; and they talked with her .
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read .
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands , therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place , and it shall not be quenched . ' "
but to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Yahweh , thus you shall tell him , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : ' concerning the words which you have heard ,
'Therefore behold , I will gather you to your fathers , and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace , neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place . ' " ' " they brought back this message to the king .
he brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh , outside of Jerusalem , to the Brook Kidron , and burned it at the Brook Kidron , and beat it to dust , and cast its dust on the graves of the common people .
moreover the altar that was at Bethel , and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , had made , even that altar and the high place he broke down ; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust , and burned the Asherah .
all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria , which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh to anger , Josiah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel .
like him was there no king before him , who turned to Yahweh with all his heart , and with all his soul , and with all his might , according to all the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him .
notwithstanding , Yahweh didn 't turn from the fierceness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo , and brought him to Jerusalem , and buried him in his own tomb . the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and anointed him , and made him king in his father 's place .
Jehoahaz was twenty @-@ three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by his servants the prophets .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
the king of Egypt didn 't come again out of his land any more ; for the king of Babylon had taken , from the Brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates , all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
he carried out there all the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold , which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yahweh 's temple , as Yahweh had said .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and encamped against it ; and they built forts against it around it .
now in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , a servant of the king of Babylon , to Jerusalem .
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Babylon , and the residue of the multitude .
the Chaldeans broke up the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh , and carried the brass pieces to Babylon .
the captain of the guard took away the fire pans , the basins , that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
as for the people who were left in the land of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , governor .
now when all the captains of the forces , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor , they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite , they and their men .
but it happened in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the royal seed came , and ten men with him , and struck Gedaliah , so that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah .
it happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , that Evilmerodach king of Babylon , in the year that he began to reign , lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison ;
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him of the king , every day a portion , all the days of his life .
Joktan became the father of Almodad , and Sheleph , and Hazarmaveth , and Jerah ,
now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom , before there reigned any king over the children of Israel : Bela the son of Beor ; and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
now these were the sons of David , who were born to him in Hebron : the firstborn , Amnon , of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess ; the second , Daniel , of Abigail the Carmelitess ;
the sons of Shelah the son of Judah : ER the father of Lecah , and Laadah the father of Mareshah , and the families of the house of those who worked fine linen , of the house of Ashbea ;
some of them , even of the sons of Simeon , five hundred men , went to Mount Seir , having for their captains Pelatiah , and Neariah , and Rephaiah , and Uzziel , the sons of Ishi .
these were the sons of Abihail , the son of Huri , the son of Jaroah , the son of Gilead , the son of Michael , the son of Jeshishai , the son of Jahdo , the son of Buz ;
the sons of Reuben , and the Gadites , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , of valiant men , men able to bear buckler and sword , and to shoot with bow , and skillful in war , were forty @-@ four thousand seven hundred and sixty , that were able to go forth to war .
these were the heads of their fathers ' houses : even Epher , and Ishi , and Eliel , and Azriel , and Jeremiah , and Hodaviah , and Jahdiel , mighty men of valor , famous men , heads of their fathers ' houses .
now these are their dwelling places according to their encampments in their borders : to the sons of Aaron , of the families of the Kohathites ( for theirs was the first lot ) ,
to the rest of the sons of Kohath were given by lot , out of the family of the tribe , out of the half @-@ tribe , the half of Manasseh , ten cities .
to the sons of Gershom , according to their families , out of the tribe of Issachar , and out of the tribe of Asher , and out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan , thirteen cities .
to the sons of Merari were given by lot , according to their families , out of the tribe of Reuben , and out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun , twelve cities .
they gave by lot out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , and out of the tribe of the children of Benjamin , these cities which are mentioned by name .
and out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , Aner with its suburbs , and Bileam with its suburbs , for the rest of the family of the sons of Kohath .
to the sons of Gershom were given , out of the family of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , Golan in Bashan with its suburbs , and Ashtaroth with its suburbs ;
and beyond the Jordan at Jericho , on the east side of the Jordan , were given them , out of the tribe of Reuben , Bezer in the wilderness with its suburbs , and Jahzah with its suburbs ,
the sons of Tola : Uzzi , and Rephaiah , and Jeriel , and Jahmai , and Ibsam , and Shemuel , heads of their fathers ' houses , of Tola ; mighty men of valor in their generations : their number in the days of David was twenty @-@ two thousand six hundred .
the sons of Bela : Ezbon , and Uzzi , and Uzziel , and Jerimoth , and IRI , five ; heads of fathers ' houses , mighty men of valor ; and they were reckoned by genealogy twenty @-@ two thousand thirty @-@ four .
all these were sons of Jediael , according to the heads of their fathers ' households , mighty men of valor , seventeen thousand and two hundred , who were able to go forth in the army for war .
Rephah was his son , and Resheph , and Telah his son , and Tahan his son ,
and by the borders of the children of Manasseh , Beth Shean and its towns , Taanach and its towns , Megiddo and its towns , Dor and its towns . in these lived the children of Joseph the son of Israel .
all these were the children of Asher , heads of the fathers ' houses , choice and mighty men of valor , chief of the princes . the number of them reckoned by genealogy for service in war was twenty @-@ six thousand men .
Uthai the son of Ammihud , the son of Omri , the son of Imri , the son of Bani , of the children of Perez the son of Judah .
and Ibneiah the son of Jeroham , and Elah the son of Uzzi , the son of Michri , and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah , the son of Reuel , the son of Ibnijah ;
and their brothers , according to their generations , nine hundred fifty @-@ six . all these men were heads of fathers ' households by their fathers ' houses .
and Azariah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , the ruler of God 's house ;
and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pashhur , the son of Malchijah , and Maasai the son of Adiel , the son of Jahzerah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Meshillemith , the son of Immer ;
and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah , the son of Galal , the son of Jeduthun , and Berechiah the son of ASA , the son of Elkanah , who lived in the villages of the Netophathites .
so they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of Yahweh , even the house of the tent , by wards .
for the four chief porters , who were Levites , were in an office of trust , and were over the rooms and over the treasuries in God 's house .
some of them also were appointed over the furniture , and over all the vessels of the sanctuary , and over the fine flour , and the wine , and the oil , and the frankincense , and the spices .
Mattithiah , one of the Levites , who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite , had the office of trust over the things that were baked in pans .
these are the singers , heads of fathers ' households of the Levites , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook their cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
all the valiant men arose , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
in times past , even when Saul was king , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yahweh your God said to you , ' You shall be shepherd of my people Israel , and you shall be prince over my people Israel . ' "
now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom , together with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
the three broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to Yahweh ,
Abishai , the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
now these are those who came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish ; and they were among the mighty men , his helpers in war .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had overflowed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war , who came to David to Hebron , to turn the kingdom of Saul to him , according to the word of Yahweh .
on the other side of the Jordan , of the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle , one hundred twenty thousand .
so David didn 't move the Ark to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
and said to them , " You are the heads of the fathers ' households of the Levites . Sanctify yourselves , both you and your brothers , that you may bring up the Ark of Yahweh , the God of Israel , to the place that I have prepared for it .
so the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brothers , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brothers , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
so David , and the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed @-@ Edom with joy .
David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites who bore the Ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : and David had on him an ephod of linen .
thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh with shouting , and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpets , and with cymbals , sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps .
so he left there , before the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , Asaph and his brothers , to minister before the Ark continually , as every day 's work required ;
to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh , which he commanded to Israel ;
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Yahweh God .
King David also dedicated these to Yahweh , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David , Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia , and out of Arammaacah , and out of Zobah .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
when the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River , with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came on them , and set the battle in array against them . so when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians , they fought with him .
David took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it ; and it was set on David 's head : and he brought forth the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword : and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword .
as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
but the word of Yahweh came to me , saying , ' You have shed blood abundantly , and have made great wars . you shall not build a house to my name , because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight .
now , behold , in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Yahweh one hundred thousand talents of gold , one million talents of silver , and brass and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance . I have also prepared timber and stone ; and you may add to them .
the sons of Amram : Aaron and Moses ; and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons , forever , to burn incense before Yahweh , to minister to him , and to bless in his name , forever .
these were the sons of Levi after their fathers ' houses , even the heads of the fathers ' houses of those who were counted individually , in the number of names by their polls , who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh , from twenty years old and upward .
for their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh , in the courts , and in the rooms , and in the purifying of all holy things , even the work of the service of God 's house ;
there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar ; and they were divided like this : of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen , heads of fathers ' houses ; and of the sons of Ithamar , according to their fathers ' houses , eight .
this was their ordering in their service , to come into the house of Yahweh according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father , as Yahweh , the God of Israel , had commanded him .
moreover , David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph , and of Heman , and of Jeduthun , who should prophesy with harps , with stringed instruments , and with cymbals : and the number of those who did the work according to their service was :
all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Yahweh , with cymbals , stringed instruments , and harps , for the service of God 's house ; Asaph , Jeduthun , and Heman being under the order of the king .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh , even all who were skillful , was two hundred eighty @-@ eight .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons : Shimri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him chief ) ,
this Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the heads of the fathers ' households , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the army , had dedicated .
all that Samuel the seer , and Saul the son of Kish , and Abner the son of Ner , and Joab the son of Zeruiah , had dedicated , whoever had dedicated anything , it was under the hand of Shelomoth , and of his brothers .
of the Hebronites , Hashabiah and his brothers , men of valor , one thousand seven hundred , had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward , for all the business of Yahweh , and for the service of the king .
of the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief , even of the Hebronites , according to their generations by fathers ' households . in the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead .
over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the towers , was Jonathan the son of Uzziah :
and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite : and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite : and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple , and of its houses , and of its treasuries , and of the upper rooms of it , and of the inner rooms of it , and of the place of the mercy seat ;
and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit , for the courts of the house of Yahweh , and for all the surrounding rooms , for the treasuries of God 's house , and for the treasuries of the dedicated things ;
also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites , and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh , and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh ;
by weight also for the lampstands of gold , and for its lamps , of gold , by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps ; and for the lampstands of silver , by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps , according to the use of every lampstand ;
in addition , because I have set my affection on the house of my God , since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver , I give it to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house ,
of gold for the things of gold , and of silver for the things of silver , and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans . who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh ? "
then the princes of the fathers ' households , and the princes of the tribes of Israel , and the captains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rulers over the king 's work , offered willingly ;
yours , Yahweh , is the greatness , the power , the glory , the victory , and the majesty ! for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours . yours is the kingdom , Yahweh , and you are exalted as head above all .
both riches and honor come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your commandments , your testimonies , and your statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "
they sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh , and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh , on the next day after that day , even one thousand bulls , one thousand rams , and one thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel ,
now the acts of David the king , first and last , behold , they are written in the history of Samuel the seer , and in the history of Nathan the prophet , and in the history of Gad the seer ,
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tent of Meeting of God , which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness .
but David had brought the Ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it ; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the bronze altar , that Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there .
they brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver , and a horse for one hundred fifty : and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah , where Yahweh appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long : the wing of the one was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
he set up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin , and the name of that on the left Boaz .
also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass ; and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it .
it stood on twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
the two pillars , and the bowls , and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars , and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ,
and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the fire pans , of pure gold : and as for the entry of the house , the inner doors of it for the most holy place , and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished . Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated , even the silver , and the gold , and all the vessels , and put them in the treasuries of the house of God .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the princes of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel , to Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David , which is Zion .
and they brought up the Ark , and the tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent ; these the priests the Levites brought up .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled to him , were before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh to its place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubim .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
it happened , when the priests had come out of the holy place , ( for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves , and didn 't keep their divisions ;
" Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as Yahweh promised , and have built the house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and to his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night , even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name ; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place .
listen to the petitions of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : yes , hear from your dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when you hear , forgive .
then hear from heaven , and do , and judge your servants , bringing retribution to the wicked , to bring his way on his own head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you afflict them :
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear from heaven , your dwelling place and forgive , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of the children of men ; )
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come from a far country for your great name 's sake , and your mighty hand , and your outstretched arm ; when they shall come and pray toward this house :
" if your people go out to battle against their enemies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
" if they sin against you ( for there is no man who doesn 't sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near ;
yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity , saying , ' We have sinned , we have done perversely , and have dealt wickedly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity , where they have carried them captive , and pray toward their land , which you gave to their fathers , and the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name :
now when Solomon had made an end of praying , the fire came down from heaven , and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices ; and the glory of Yahweh filled the house .
thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house : and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of Yahweh , and in his own house .
if my people , who are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom , according as I covenanted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel . '
and Baalath , and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and all the cities for his chariots , and the cities for his horsemen , and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people who were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ;
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the Sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the set feasts , three times in the year , in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tents .
Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants ; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
however I didn 't believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and behold , the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me : you exceed the fame that I heard .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , aren 't they written in the history of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it , ( for he was in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you , saying , ' Your father made our yoke heavy , but make it lighter on us ; ' thus you shall say to them , ' My little finger is thicker than my father 's waist .
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get himself up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Yahweh ;
so they strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong , three years ; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon .
he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin , to every fortified city : and he gave them food in abundance . he sought for them many wives .
it happened , when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established , and he was strong , that he forsook the law of Yahweh , and all Israel with him .
so Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house . he took it all away . he also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
now the acts of Rehoboam , first and last , aren 't they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer , after the way of genealogies ? there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
ought you not to know that Yahweh , the God of Israel , gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever , even to him and to his sons by a Covenant of salt ?
behold , God is with us at our head , and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you . children of Israel , don 't fight against Yahweh , the God of your fathers ; for you shall not prosper . "
then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it happened , that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
ASA and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar : and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves ; for they were destroyed before Yahweh , and before his army ; and they carried away very much booty .
in those times there was no peace to him who went out , nor to him who came in ; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands .
all Judah rejoiced at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and Yahweh gave them rest all around .
also Maacah , the mother of ASA the king , he removed from being queen , because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah ; and ASA cut down her image , and made dust of it , and burnt it at the Brook Kidron .
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of ASA , Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to ASA king of Judah .
at that time Hanani the seer came to ASA king of Judah , and said to him , " Because you have relied on the king of Syria , and have not relied on Yahweh your God , therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand .
for the eyes of Yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth , to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . herein you have done foolishly ; for from henceforth you shall have wars . "
then ASA was angry with the seer , and put him in the prison ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . ASA oppressed some of the people at the same time .
in the thirty @-@ ninth year of his reign ASA was diseased in his feet ; his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he didn 't seek Yahweh , but to the physicians .
they taught in Judah , having the book of the law of Yahweh with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught among the people .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand ;
now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " It is the king of Israel ! " therefore they turned around to fight against him . but Jehoshaphat cried out , and Yahweh helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a certain man drew his bow at random , and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor . therefore he said to the driver of the chariot , " Turn your hand , and carry me out of the army ; for I am severely wounded . "
the battle increased that day . however the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening ; and about the time of the going down of the sun , he died .
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , the Levite , of the sons of Asaph , in the midst of the assembly ;
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites , stood up to praise Yahweh , the God of Israel , with an exceeding loud voice .
for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir , utterly to kill and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , everyone helped to destroy another .
Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani , which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel .
now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father , and had strengthened himself , he killed all his brothers with the sword , and various also of the princes of Israel .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet , saying , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of David your father , ' Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father , nor in the ways of ASA king of Judah ,
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute , like the house of Ahab did , and also have slain your brothers of your father 's house , who were better than yourself :
and they came up against Judah , and broke into it , and carried away all the substance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wives ; so that there was never a son left him , except Jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
it happened , when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab , that he found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah , ministering to Ahaziah , and killed them .
in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into Covenant with him .
they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the heads of fathers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
this is the thing that you shall do . a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be porters of the thresholds .
a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation . all the people shall be in the courts of Yahweh 's house .
but let no one come into the house of Yahweh , except the priests , and those who minister of the Levites . they shall come in , for they are holy , but all the people shall follow Yahweh 's instructions .
the Levites shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . whoever comes into the house , let him be slain . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
so the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded : and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sabbath ; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath ; for Jehoiada the priest didn 't dismiss the shift .
Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king David 's , which were in God 's house .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
all the people went to the house of Baal , and broke it down , and broke his altars and his images in pieces , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
he took the captains of hundreds , and the nobles , and the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of Yahweh : and they came through the upper gate to the king 's house , and set the king on the throne of the kingdom .
the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh ; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Yahweh , and also such as worked iron and brass to repair the house of Yahweh .
it happened at the end of the year , that the army of the Syrians came up against him : and they came to Judah and Jerusalem , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus .
Amaziah was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan , of Jerusalem .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
then Amaziah separated them , the army that had come to him out of Ephraim , to go home again : therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in fierce anger .
the children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
now it happened , after that Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites , that he brought the gods of the children of Seir , and set them up to be his gods , and bowed down himself before them , and burned incense to them .
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent to him a prophet , who said to him , " Why have you sought after the gods of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
you say to yourself that you have struck Edom ; and your heart lifts you up to boast . now stay at home . why should you meddle with trouble , that you should fall , even you , and Judah with you ? ' "
Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz , at Beth Shemesh , and brought him to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh , they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem . he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish , and killed him there .
he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and broke down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod ; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
Azariah the chief priest , and all the priests , looked on him , and behold , he was leprous in his forehead , and they thrust him out quickly from there ; yes , himself hurried also to go out , because Yahweh had struck him .
Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
so Uzziah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , " He is a leper . " Jotham his son reigned in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , like David his father ;
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against those who came from the war ,
the Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland , and of the South of Judah , and had taken Beth Shemesh , and Aijalon , and Gederoth , and Soco with its towns , and Timnah with its towns , Gimzo also and its towns : and they lived there .
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh , and out of the house of the king and of the princes , and gave it to the king of Assyria : but it didn 't help him .
Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God 's house , and cut in pieces the vessels of God 's house , and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh ; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem ; for they didn 't bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place .
Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty @-@ five years old ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh , and turned their backs .
the priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh , to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in Yahweh 's temple into the court of the house of Yahweh . the Levites took it , to carry it out abroad to the Brook Kidron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Yahweh ; and they sanctified the house of Yahweh in eight days : and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end .
then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace , and said , " We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh , and the altar of burnt offering , with all its vessels , and the table of show bread , with all its vessels .
so they killed the bulls , and the priests received the blood , and sprinkled it on the altar : and they killed the rams , and sprinkled the blood on the altar : they killed also the lambs , and sprinkled the blood on the altar .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
Don 't be like your fathers , and like your brothers , who trespassed against Yahweh , the God of their fathers , so that he gave them up to desolation , as you see .
for Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
all the assembly of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Judah , rejoiced .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings , for the morning and evening burnt offerings , and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths , and for the new moons , and for the set feasts , as it is written in the law of Yahweh .
the children of Israel and Judah , who lived in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep , and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God , and laid them by heaps .
he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
after this , Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem , ( now he was before Lachish , and all his power with him ) , to Hezekiah king of Judah , and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem , saying ,
Don 't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Yahweh didn 't come on them in the days of Hezekiah .
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his good deeds , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz , in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death . Manasseh his son reigned in his place .
he also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom ; and he practiced sorcery , and used enchantments , and practiced sorcery , and dealt with those who had familiar spirits , and with wizards : he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
he took away the foreign gods , and the idol out of the house of Yahweh , and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Yahweh , and in Jerusalem , and cast them out of the city .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and his prayer to his God , and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel , behold , they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel .
his prayer also , and how God was entreated of him , and all his sin and his trespass , and the places in which he built high places , and set up the Asherim and the engraved images , before he humbled himself : behold , they are written in the history of Hozai .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did Manasseh his father ; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in the ways of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh ; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house ;
they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers , and into the hand of the workmen . "
so Hilkiah , and they whom the king had commanded , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter ; ) and they spoke to her to that effect .
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah .
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place , and it shall not be quenched . ' " '
but to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Yahweh , thus you shall tell him , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : " as touching the words which you have heard ,
stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fathers ' house of the Levites .
Josiah gave to the children of the people , of the flock , lambs and young goats , all of them for the Passover offerings , to all who were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bulls : these were of the king 's substance .
they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of the children of the people , to offer to Yahweh , as it is written in the book of Moses . so they did with the cattle .
they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so his servants took him out of the chariot , and put him in the second chariot that he had , and brought him to Jerusalem ; and he died , and was buried in the tombs of his fathers . all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place .
moreover all the chiefs of the priests , and the people , trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations ; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had made holy in Jerusalem .
Yahweh , the God of their fathers , sent to them by his messengers , rising up early and sending , because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
all the vessels of God 's house , great and small , and the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes , all these he brought to Babylon .
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
whoever there is among you of all his people , may his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem , which is in Judah , and build the house of Yahweh , the God of Israel ( he is God ) , which is in Jerusalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with precious things , besides all that was willingly offered .
now these are the children of the province , who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon , and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah , everyone to his city ;
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all one hundred thirty @-@ nine .
of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
some of the heads of fathers ' households , when they came to the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem , offered willingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the altar on its base ; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers , Kadmiel and his sons , the sons of Judah , together , to have the oversight of the workmen in God 's house : the sons of Henadad , with their sons and their brothers the Levites .
but many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers ' households , the old men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice . many also shouted aloud for joy ,
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people ; for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the noise was heard far away .
in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and the rest of his companions , to Artaxerxes king of Persia ; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian , and set forth in the Syrian language .
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over , and set in the city of Samaria , and in the rest of the country beyond the River , and so forth , wrote .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tribute , custom , or toll , and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings .
then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor , and to Shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria , and in the rest of the country beyond the River : peace , and so forth .
I decreed , and search has been made , and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein .
then when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
now the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem ; in the name of the God of Israel they prophesied to them .
but the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews , and they did not make them cease , until the matter should come to Darius , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the gold and silver vessels also of God 's house , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem , and brought into the temple of Babylon , those Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar , whom he had made governor ;
then the same Sheshbazzar came , and laid the foundations of God 's house which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now has it been in building , and yet it is not completed .
then Darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the archives , where the treasures were laid up in Babylon .
also I have made a decree , that whoever shall alter this word , let a beam be pulled out from his house , and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon ; and let his house be made a dunghill for this :
the children of Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the captivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land , to seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , ate ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest , the scribe , even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Yahweh , and of his statutes to Israel :
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Levites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem ;
therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls , rams , lambs , with their meal offerings and their drink offerings , and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
whatever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven ; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
also we inform you , that touching any of the priests and Levites , the singers , porters , Nethinim , or servants of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose tribute , custom , or toll , on them .
whoever will not do the law of your God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed on him with all diligence , whether it be to death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
blessed be Yahweh , the God of our fathers , who has put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to beautify the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem ;
now these are the heads of their fathers ' households , and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon , in the reign of Artaxerxes the king :
then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , who were teachers .
and weighed to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering for the house of our God , which the king , and his counselors , and his princes , and all Israel there present , had offered :
watch , and keep them , until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites , and the princes of the fathers ' households of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the rooms of the house of Yahweh . "
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons , so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass . "
when I heard this thing , I tore my garment and my robe , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down confounded .
and I said , " My God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our iniquities have increased over our head , and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens .
Shecaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , answered Ezra , " We have trespassed against our God , and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land . yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing .
then Ezra rose up from before God 's house , and went into the room of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib : and when he came there , he ate no bread , nor drank water ; for he mourned because of their trespass of the captivity .
the children of the captivity did so . Ezra the priest , with certain heads of fathers ' households , after their fathers ' houses , and all of them by their names , were set apart ; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women : of the sons of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and his brothers , Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
that Hanani , one of my brothers , came , he and certain men out of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days ; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven ,
but if you return to me , and keep my commandments and do them , though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens , yet will I gather them from there , and will bring them to the place that I have chosen , to cause my name to dwell there . '
it happened in the month Nisan , in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king , when wine was before him , that I took up the wine , and gave it to the king . now I had not been sad before in his presence .
I said to the king , " Let the king live forever ! why shouldn 't my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' tombs , lies waste , and its gates have been consumed with fire ? "
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
I arose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem ; neither was there any animal with me , except the animal that I rode on .
I went out by night by the valley gate , even toward the Jackal 's well , and to the Dung gate , and viewed the walls of Jerusalem , which were broken down , and its gates were consumed with fire .
the rulers didn 't know where I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest who did the work .
but when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian , heard it , they ridiculed us , and despised us , and said , " What is this thing that you are doing ? will you rebel against the king ? "
then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests , and they built the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up its doors ; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it , to the tower of Hananel .
next to them , Meremoth the son of Uriah , the son of Hakkoz made repairs . next to them , Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabel made repairs . next to them , Zadok the son of Baana made repairs .
Malchijah the son of Rechab , the ruler of the district of Beth Haccherem repaired the Dung gate . he built it , and set up its doors , its bolts , and its bars .
after him , Nehemiah the son of Azbuk , the ruler of half the district of Beth Zur , made repairs to the place opposite the tombs of David , and to the pool that was made , and to the house of the mighty men .
Palal the son of Uzai made repairs opposite the turning of the wall , and the tower that stands out from the upper house of the king , which is by the court of the guard . after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs .
but it happened that when Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabians , the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward , and that the breaches began to be filled , then they were very angry ;
it happened , when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their counsel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
it happened from that time forth , that half of my servants worked in the work , and half of them held the spears , the shields , and the bows , and the coats of mail ; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah .
they all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves ; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work , and with the other held his weapon ;
moreover there were at my table , of the Jews and the rulers , one hundred fifty men , besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us .
you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem , saying , ' There is a king in Judah ! ' now it will be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together . "
it happened , when all our enemies heard of it , that all the nations that were about us were afraid , and were much cast down in their own eyes ; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God .
for there were many in Judah sworn to him , because he was the son @-@ in @-@ law of Shecaniah the son of Arah ; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife .
these are the children of the province , who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away , and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah , everyone to his city ;
the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , one hundred thirty @-@ eight .
of the priests : the children of Hobaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
so the priests , and the Levites , and the porters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the Nethinim , and all Israel , lived in their cities . when the seventh month had come , the children of Israel were in their cities .
also Jeshua , and Bani , and Sherebiah , Jamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodiah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Jozabad , Hanan , Pelaiah , and the Levites , caused the people to understand the law : and the people stayed in their place .
on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers ' households of all the people , the priests , and the Levites , to Ezra the scribe , even to give attention to the words of the law .
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves booths , everyone on the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim .
all the assembly of those who had come again out of the captivity made booths , and lived in the booths ; for since the days of Jeshua the son of nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so . there was very great gladness .
also day by day , from the first day to the last day , he read in the book of the law of God . they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly , according to the ordinance .
and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh , and against all his servants , and against all the people of his land ; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them , and made a name for yourself , as it is this day .
moreover , in a pillar of cloud you led them by day ; and in a pillar of fire by night , to give them light in the way in which they should go .
and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger , and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them .
moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples , which you allotted according to their portions . so they possessed the land of Sihon , even the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
you also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets . yet would they not give ear . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept your law , nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them .
for they have not served you in their kingdom , and in your great Goodness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their wicked works .
" behold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good , behold , we are servants in it .
it yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins : also they have power over our bodies , and over our livestock , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
and to bring the first fruits of our ground , and the first fruits of all fruit of all kinds of trees , year by year , to the house of Yahweh ;
also the firstborn of our sons , and of our livestock , as it is written in the law , and the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks , to bring to the house of our God , to the priests who minister in the house of our God ;
the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites , when the Levites take tithes : and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God , to the rooms , into the treasure house .
in Jerusalem lived certain of the children of Judah , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Judah : Athaiah the son of Uzziah , the son of Zechariah , the son of Amariah , the son of Shephatiah , the son of Mahalalel , of the children of Perez ;
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch , the son of Colhozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of the Shilonite .
these are the sons of Benjamin : Sallu the son of Meshullam , the son of Joed , the son of Pedaiah , the son of Kolaiah , the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ithiel , the son of Jeshaiah .
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , the ruler of God 's house ,
and their brothers who did the work of the house , eight hundred twenty @-@ two ; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pelaliah , the son of Amzi , the son of Zechariah , the son of Pashhur , the son of Malchijah ,
and his brothers , chiefs of fathers ' households , two hundred forty @-@ two ; and Amashsai the son of Azarel , the son of Ahzai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
as for the Levites , in the days of Eliashib , Joiada , and Johanan , and Jaddua , there were recorded the heads of fathers ' households ; also the priests , in the reign of Darius the Persian .
the sons of Levi , heads of fathers ' households , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
the chiefs of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brothers over against them , to praise and give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , watch next to watch .
then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall , and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession . one went on the right hand on the wall toward the Dung gate ;
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets : Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph ;
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
and above the gate of Ephraim , and by the old gate , and by the fish gate , and the tower of Hananel , and the tower of Hammeah , even to the sheep gate : and they stood still in the gate of the guard .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them ; so that the Levites and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
there lived men of Tyre also therein , who brought in fish , and all kinds of wares , and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
then I testified against them , and said to them , " Why do you stay around the wall ? if you do so again , I will lay hands on you . " from that time on , they didn 't come on the Sabbath .
I contended with them , and Cursed them , and struck certain of them , and plucked off their hair , and made them swear by God , " You shall not give your daughters to their sons , nor take their daughters for your sons , or for yourselves .
one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son @-@ in @-@ law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus ( this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia , over one hundred twenty @-@ seven provinces ) ,
that in those days , when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace , both great and small , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
in accordance with the law , the drinking was not compulsory ; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleasure .
for this deed of the queen will become known to all women , causing them to show contempt for their husbands , when it is reported , ' King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she didn 't come . '
for he sent letters into all the king 's provinces , into every province according to its writing , and to every people in their language , that every man should rule his own house , speaking in the language of his own people .
the young woman then came to the king like this : whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women 's house to the king 's house .
the king loved Esther more than all the women , and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he set the royal crown on her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
in those days , while Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh , who were doorkeepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus .
when this matter was investigated , and it was found to be so , they were both hanged on a tree ; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king 's presence .
all the king 's servants who were in the king 's gate bowed down , and paid Homage to Haman ; for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mordecai didn 't bow down or pay him Homage .
but he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone , for they had made known to him Mordecai 's people . therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even Mordecai 's people .
if it pleases the king , let it be written that they be destroyed ; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king 's business , to bring it into the king 's treasuries . "
then Esther called for Hathach , one of the king 's eunuchs , whom he had appointed to attend her , and commanded him to go to Mordecai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal clothing , and stood in the inner court of the king 's house , next to the king 's house . the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house , next to the entrance of the house .
when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court , she obtained favor in his sight ; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand . so Esther came near , and touched the top of the scepter .
then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart , but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he didn 't stand up nor move for him , he was filled with wrath against Mordecai .
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
on that night , the king couldn 't sleep . he commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought , and they were read to the king .
the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition , queen Esther ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
then Esther the queen answered , " If I have found favor in your sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
Esther spoke yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
they killed Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
the Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and killed three hundred men in Shushan ; but they didn 't lay their hand on the spoil .
therefore the Jews of the villages , who live in the unwalled towns , make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting , a good day , and a day of sending presents of food to one another .
because Haman the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , had plotted against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast " PUR , " that is the lot , to consume them , and to destroy them ;
but when this became known to the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he had devised against the Jews , should return on his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
all the acts of his power and of his might , and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai , to which the king advanced him , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
Yahweh said to Satan , " Where have you come from ? " then Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . "
Yahweh said to Satan , " Where have you come from ? " Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . "
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and didn 't recognize him , they raised their voices , and wept ; and they each tore his robe , and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky .
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of its twilight be dark . let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the eyelids of the morning ,
" my soul is weary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
if I am wicked , woe to me . if I am righteous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with disgrace , and conscious of my affliction .
" ' why , then , have you brought me forth out of the womb ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me .
in the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune . it is ready for them whose foot slips .
you also put my feet in the stocks , and mark all my paths . you set a bound to the soles of my feet ,
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the neck , and dashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .
if I have said to corruption , ' You are my father ; ' to the worm , ' My mother , ' and ' my sister ; '
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a stranger . " my heart is consumed within me .
that for which he labored he shall restore , and shall not swallow it down . according to the substance that he has gotten , he shall not rejoice .
in the fullness of his sufficiency , distress shall overtake him . the hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him .
they are exalted ; yet a little while , and they are gone . yes , they are brought low , they are taken out of the way as all others , and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain .
then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel , the Buzite , of the family of Ram , was kindled against Job . his wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God .
it was so , that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job , Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite , " My wrath is kindled against you , and against your two friends ; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant Job has .

< < For the Chief Musician . by David , the servant of Yahweh . > > An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked : " there is no fear of God before his eyes . "

he brought me up also out of a horrible pit , out of the miry clay . he set my feet on a rock , and gave me a firm place to stand .
I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart . I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation . I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly .
for innumerable evils have surrounded me . my iniquities have overtaken me , so that I am not able to look up . they are more than the hairs of my head . my heart has failed me .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > blessed is he who considers the poor . Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil .

because of the voice of the enemy , Because of the oppression of the wicked . for they bring suffering on me . in anger they hold a grudge against me .

but as for me , my prayer is to you , Yahweh , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation .
< < For the Chief Musician . by David . a reminder . > > hurry , God , to deliver me . come quickly to help me , Yahweh .

for the enemy pursues my soul . he has struck my life down to the ground . he has made me live in dark places , as those who have been long dead .
cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning , for I trust in you . cause me to know the way in which I should walk , for I lift up my soul to you .

I also will laugh at your disaster . I will mock when calamity overtakes you ;
when you lie down , you will not be afraid . yes , you will lie down , and your sleep will be sweet .
Don 't withhold good from those to whom it is due , when it is in the power of your hand to do it .
even a fool , when he keeps silent , is counted wise . when he shuts his lips , he is thought to be discerning .
if you say , " behold , we didn 't know this " ; doesn 't he who weighs the hearts consider it ? he who keeps your soul , doesn 't he know it ? shall he not render to every man according to his work ?
for it is better that it be said to you , " Come up here , " than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince , whom your eyes have seen .
Don 't forsake your friend and your father 's friend . Don 't go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother .
the way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent on a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maiden .
the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north . it turns around continually as it goes , and the wind returns again to its courses .
there is no memory of the former ; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come , among those that shall come after .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
I also gathered silver and gold for myself , and the treasure of kings and of the provinces . I got myself male and female singers , and the delights of the sons of men--musical instruments , and that of all sorts .
then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked , and at the labor that I had labored to do ; and behold , all was vanity and a chasing after wind , and there was no profit under the sun .
for of the wise man , even as of the fool , there is no memory for ever , since in the days to come all will have been long forgotten . indeed , the wise man must die just like the fool !
who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool ? yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored , and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun . this also is vanity .
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and make his soul enjoy good in his labor . this also I saw , that it is from the hand of God .
he has made everything beautiful in its time . he has also set eternity in their hearts , yet so that man can 't find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end .
then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold , the tears of those who were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but woe to him who is alone when he falls , and doesn 't have another to lift him up .
Don 't be rash with your mouth , and don 't let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God ; for God is in heaven , and you on earth . therefore let your words be few .
as he came forth from his mother 's womb , naked shall he go again as he came , and shall take nothing for his labor , which he may carry away in his hand .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
in the day of prosperity be joyful , and in the day of adversity consider ; yes , God has made the one side by side with the other , to the end that man should not find out anything after him .
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don 't withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things , and to know that wickedness is stupidity , and that foolishness is madness .
which my soul still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
there is a vanity which is done on the earth , that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked . again , there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous . I said that this also is vanity .
when I applied my heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done on the earth ( for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes ) ,
also their love , their hatred , and their envy has perished long ago ; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun .
for man also doesn 't know his time . as the fish that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare , even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falls suddenly on them .
Don 't curse the king , no , not in your thoughts ; and don 't curse the rich in your bedroom : for a bird of the sky may carry your voice , and that which has wings may tell the matter .
if the clouds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the earth ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
as you don 't know what is the way of the wind , nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child ; even so you don 't know the work of God who does all .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are darkened ,
and the doors shall be shut in the street ; when the sound of the grinding is low , and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird , and all the daughters of music shall be brought low ;
Don 't stare at me because I am dark , because the sun has scorched me . my mother 's sons were angry with me . they made me keeper of the vineyards . I haven 't kept my own vineyard .
my dove in the clefts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountainside , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is sweet , and your face is lovely .
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn 't find him .
I had scarcely passed from them , when I found him whom my soul loves . I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother 's house , into the room of her who conceived me .
go forth , you daughters of Zion , and see king Solomon , with the crown with which his mother has crowned him , in the day of his weddings , in the day of the gladness of his heart . Lover
come with me from Lebanon , my bride , with me from Lebanon . look from the top of Amana , from the top of Senir and Hermon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
I opened to my beloved ; but my beloved left ; and had gone away . my heart went out when he spoke . I looked for him , but I didn 't find him . I called him , but he didn 't answer .
Oh that you were like my brother , who nursed from the breasts of my mother ! if I found you outside , I would kiss you ; yes , and no one would despise me .
from the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it : wounds , welts , and open sores . they haven 't been closed , neither bandaged , neither soothed with oil .
it shall happen in the latter days , that the mountain of Yahweh 's house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be raised above the hills ; and all nations shall flow to it .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots .
for there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and haughty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low ; and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day .
the people will be oppressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neighbor . the child will behave himself proudly against the old man , and the base against the honorable .
it shall happen that instead of sweet spices , there shall be rottenness ; instead of a belt , a rope ; instead of well set hair , baldness ; instead of a robe , a wearing of sackcloth ; and branding instead of beauty .
when the Lord shall have washed away the Filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst , by the spirit of justice , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my vineyard , that I have not done in it ? why , when I looked for it to yield grapes , did it yield wild grapes ?
now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard . I will take away its hedge , and it will be eaten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be trampled down .
for the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel , and the men of Judah his pleasant plant : and he looked for justice , but , behold , oppression ; for righteousness , but , behold , a cry of distress .
Woe to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land !
who say , " Let him make speed , let him hasten his work , that we may see it ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
none shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the belt of their waist be untied , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken :
their roaring will be like a lioness . they will roar like young lions . yes , they shall roar , and seize their prey and carry it off , and there will be no one to deliver .
if there is a tenth left in it , that also will in turn be consumed : as a terebinth , and as an oak , whose stock remains when they are felled ; so the holy seed is its stock . "
it happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up to Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
it was told the house of David , saying , " Syria is allied with Ephraim . " his heart trembled , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind .
" let 's go up against Judah , and tear it apart , and let 's divide it among ourselves , and set up a king in its midst , even the son of Tabeel . "
it will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
in that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River , even with the king of Assyria , the head and the hair of the feet ; and it shall also consume the beard .
and it shall happen , that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter : for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left in the midst of the land .
all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe , you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of sheep . "
for before the child knows how to say , ' My father , ' and , ' My mother , ' the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria . "
now therefore , behold , the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River : the king of Assyria and all his glory . it will come up over all its channels , and go over all its banks .
they will pass through it , very distressed and hungry ; and it will happen that when they are hungry , they will worry , and curse by their king and by their God . they will turn their faces upward ,
for all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle , and the garments rolled in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
for wickedness burns like a fire . it devours the briers and thorns ; yes , it kindles in the thickets of the forest , and they roll upward in a column of smoke .
one will devour on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he will eat on the left hand , and they will not be satisfied . everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm :
what will you do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which will come from afar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
however he doesn 't mean so , neither does his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy , and to cut off not a few nations .
therefore it will happen that , when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria , and the insolence of his haughty looks .
should an axe brag against him who chops with it ? should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it ? as if a rod should lift those who lift it up , or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood .
it will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel , and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them , but shall lean on Yahweh , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
it will happen in that day , that his burden will depart from off your shoulder , and his yoke from off your neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil .
but with righteousness he will judge the poor , and decide with equity for the humble of the earth . he will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth ; and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked .
they will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west . together they will plunder the children of the east . they will extend their power over Edom and Moab , and the children of Ammon will obey them .
behold , God is my salvation . I will trust , and will not be afraid ; for Yah , Yahweh , is my strength and song ; and he has become my salvation . "
for the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light . the sun will be darkened in its going forth , and the moon will not cause its light to shine .
it will happen that like a hunted gazelle , and like sheep that no one gathers , they will each turn to their own people , and will each flee to their own land .
their bows will dash the young men in pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb . their eyes will not spare children .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Arabian will not pitch a tent there , neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there .
for Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land . the foreigner will join himself with them , and they will unite with the house of Jacob .
the peoples will take them , and bring them to their place . the house of Israel will possess them in Yahweh 's land for servants and for handmaids . they will take as captives those whose captives they were ; and they shall rule over their oppressors .
it will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
that I will break the Assyrian in my land , and tread him under foot on my mountains . then his yoke will leave them , and his burden leave their shoulders .
Don 't rejoice , O Philistia , all of you , because the rod that struck you is broken ; for out of the serpent 's root an adder will emerge , and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent .
my heart cries out for Moab ! her nobles flee to Zoar , to Eglath Shelishiyah ; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping ; for in the way of Horonaim , they raise up a cry of destruction .
a throne will be established in loving kindness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , judging , seeking justice , and swift to do righteousness .
for the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah . the lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches , which reached even to Jazer , which wandered into the wilderness . its shoots were spread abroad . they passed over the sea .
they will not look to the altars , the work of their hands ; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made , either the Asherim , or the incense altars .
in the day of your planting , you hedge it in . in the morning , you make your seed blossom , but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
the nations will rush like the rushing of many waters : but he will rebuke them , and they will flee far off , and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like the whirling dust before the storm .
at evening , behold , terror ! before the morning , they are no more . this is the portion of those who plunder us , and the lot of those who rob us .
for before the harvest , when the blossom is over , and the flower becomes a ripening grape , he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks , and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches .
they will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains , and for the animals of the earth . the ravenous birds will summer on them , and all the animals of the earth will winter on them .
the burden of Egypt : " behold , Yahweh rides on a swift cloud , and comes to Egypt . the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence ; and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst .
the meadows by the Nile , by the brink of the Nile , and all the sown fields of the Nile , will become dry , be driven away , and be no more .
Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works , like a drunken man staggers in his vomit .

at that time they shall call Jerusalem ' The throne of Yahweh ; ' and all the nations shall be gathered to it , to the name of Yahweh , to Jerusalem . neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart .

now , because you have done all these works , says Yahweh , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you didn 't hear ; and I called you , but you didn 't answer :
the children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead the dough , to make cakes to the queen of the sky , and to pour out drink offerings to other gods , that they may provoke me to anger .
for I didn 't speak to your fathers , nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
but this thing I commanded them , saying , listen to my voice , and I will be your God , and you shall be my people ; and walk in all the way that I command you , that it may be well with you .
since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day , I have sent to you all my servants the prophets , daily rising up early and sending them :
they have built the high places of Topheth , which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I didn 't command , nor did it come into my mind .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that it shall no more be called Topheth , nor The valley of the son of Hinnom , but The valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in Topheth , until there is no place to bury .
then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah , and from the streets of Jerusalem , the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride ; for the land shall become a waste .

for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing , even altars to burn incense to Baal .

thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors , who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit : behold , I will pluck them up from off their land , and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them .

then I went to the Euphrates , and dug , and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it ; and behold , the belt was marred , it was profitable for nothing .

I will dash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , says Yahweh : I will not pity , nor spare , nor have compassion , that I should not destroy them .

the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword ; and they shall have none to bury them--them , their wives , nor their sons , nor their daughters : for I will pour their wickedness on them .

for thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who bore them , and concerning their fathers who became their father in this land :
neither shall men break bread for them in mourning , to comfort them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will cause to cease out of this place , before your eyes and in your days , the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride .

for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , a salt land and not inhabited .

thus said Yahweh to me : go , and stand in the gate of the children of the people , through which the kings of Judah come in , and by which they go out , and in all the gates of Jerusalem ;
it shall happen , if you diligently listen to me , says Yahweh , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day , but to make the Sabbath day holy , to do no work therein ;
they shall come from the cities of Judah , and from the places around Jerusalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the lowland , and from the hill country , and from the South , bringing burnt offerings , and sacrifices , and meal offerings , and frankincense , and bringing sacrifices of Thanksgiving , to the house of Yahweh .

I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies , and by the hand of those who seek their life : and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the earth .
I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters ; and they shall eat everyone the flesh of his friend , in the siege and in the distress , with which their enemies , and those who seek their life , shall distress them .
and the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses of the kings of Judah , which are defiled , shall be as the place of Topheth , even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky , and have poured out drink offerings to other gods .
then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yahweh .

he who remains in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he who goes out , and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you , he shall live , and his life shall be to him for a prey .
behold , I am against you , O inhabitant of the valley , and of the rock of the plain , says Yahweh ; you that say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?

for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life , and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid , even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of the Chaldeans .

but if they had stood in my council , then had they caused my people to hear my words , and had turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their doings .
therefore , behold , I will utterly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers , away from my presence :
one basket had very good figs , like the figs that are first @-@ ripe ; and the other basket had very bad figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : like these good figs , so will I regard the captives of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans , for good .
for I will set my eyes on them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pluck them up .
I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil ; to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all places where I shall drive them .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah ( the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) ,
from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , even to this day , these twenty @-@ three years , the word of Yahweh has come to me , and I have spoken to you , rising up early and speaking ; but you have not listened .
Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not listened , nor inclined your ear to hear )
moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones , and the light of the lamp .
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , to me : take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send you , to drink it .
Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and its kings , and its princes , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , a hissing , and a curse , as it is this day ;
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the Uz , and all the kings of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Gaza , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the kingdoms of the world , which are on the surface of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
a noise shall come even to the end of the earth ; for Yahweh has a controversy with the nations ; he will enter into judgment with all flesh : as for the wicked , he will give them to the sword , says Yahweh .
the slain of Yahweh shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth : they shall not be lamented , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be Dung on the surface of the ground .
thus says Yahweh : stand in the court of Yahweh 's house , and speak to all the cities of Judah , which come to worship in Yahweh 's house , all the words that I command you to speak to them ; don 't diminish a word .
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his evil way ; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings .
to listen to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I send to you , even rising up early and sending them , but you have not listened ;
it happened , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him , saying , You shall surely die .
when the princes of Judah heard these things , they came up from the king 's house to the house of Yahweh ; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh 's house .
and when Jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when Uriah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt :
and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt , and brought him to Jehoiakim the king , who killed him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
and send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the children of Ammon , and to the king of Tyre , and to the king of Sidon , by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah ;
I have made the earth , the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth , by my great power and by my outstretched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
but as for you , don 't you listen to your prophets , nor to your diviners , nor to your dreams , nor to your soothsayers , nor to your sorcerers , who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon :
yes , thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yahweh , and in the house of the king of Judah , and at Jerusalem :
it happened the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , that Hananiah the son of Azzur , the prophet , who was of Gibeon , spoke to me in the house of Yahweh , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried to Babylon :
and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah , who went to Babylon , says Yahweh ; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon .
then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) , saying ,
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : Don 't let your prophets who are in the midst of you , and your diviners , deceive you ; neither listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed .
thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne of David , and concerning all the people who dwell in this city , your brothers who haven 't gone forth with you into captivity ;
Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest , that there may be officers in the house of Yahweh , for every man who is mad , and makes himself a prophet , that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles .
send to all them of the captivity , saying , Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite : because Shemaiah has prophesied to you , and I didn 't send him , and he has caused you to trust in a lie ;
all your lovers have forgotten you ; they don 't seek you : for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one , for the greatness of your iniquity , because your sins were increased .
therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured ; and all your adversaries , everyone of them , shall go into captivity ; and those who despoil you shall be a spoil , and all who prey on you will I give for a prey .
thus says Yahweh : behold , I will turn again the captivity of Jacob 's tents , and have compassion on his dwelling places ; and the city shall be built on its own hill , and the palace shall be inhabited in its own way .
out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
their prince shall be of themselves , and their ruler shall proceed from their midst ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach to me : for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me ? says Yahweh .
again will I build you , and you shall be built , O virgin of Israel : again you shall be adorned with your tambourines , and shall go forth in the dances of those who make merry .
they shall come with weeping ; and with petitions will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters , in a straight way in which they shall not stumble ; for I am a father to Israel , and Ephraim is my firstborn .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , and the young men and the old together ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I struck on my thigh : I was ashamed , yes , even confounded , because I bore the reproach of my youth .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of animal .
not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my Covenant they broke , although I was a husband to them , says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : if heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , says Yahweh .
now at that time the king of Babylon 's army was besieging Jerusalem ; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard , which was in the king of Judah 's house .
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall see his eyes ;
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : take these deeds , this deed of the purchase which is sealed , and this deed which is open , and put them in an earthen vessel ; that they may continue many days .
and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror ;
for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth ; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , says Yahweh .
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
they have turned to me the back , and not the face : and though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not listened to receive instruction .
now therefore thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , concerning this city , about which you say , It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence :
behold , I will gather them out of all the countries , where I have driven them in my anger , and in my wrath , and in great indignation ; and I will bring them again to this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will make an everlasting Covenant with them , that I will not turn away from following them , to do them good ; and I will put my fear in their hearts , that they may not depart from me .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , by which they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , by which they have sinned against me , and by which they have transgressed against me .
in the cities of the hill country , in the cities of the lowland , and in the cities of the South , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them , says Yahweh .
as the army of the sky can 't be numbered , neither the sand of the sea measured ; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant , and the Levites who minister to me .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of it , saying :
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , Go , and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah , and tell him , Thus says Yahweh , behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
when the king of Babylon 's army was fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish and against Azekah ; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities .
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that the king Zedekiah had made a Covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty to them ;
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess , go free ; that none should make bondservants of them , of a Jew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
at the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew , who has been sold to you , and has served you six years , you shall let him go free from you : but your fathers didn 't listen to me , neither inclined their ear .
but you turned and profaned my name , and caused every man his servant , and every man his handmaid , whom you had let go free at their pleasure , to return ; and you brought them into subjection , to be to you for servants and for handmaids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life ; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky , and to the animals of the earth .
Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , who have gone away from you .
go to the house of the Rechabites , and speak to them , and bring them into the house of Yahweh , into one of the rooms , and give them wine to drink .
we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , in all that he commanded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , or our daughters ;
but it happened , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians ; so we dwell at Jerusalem .
take a scroll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spoke to you , from the days of Josiah , even to this day .
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
therefore you go , and read in the scroll , which you have written from my mouth , the words of Yahweh in the ears of the people in Yahweh 's house on the fast day ; and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities .
now it happened in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , in the ninth month , that all the people in Jerusalem , and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem , proclaimed a fast before Yahweh .
then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh , in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan , the scribe , in the upper court , at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh 's house , in the ears of all the people .
he went down into the king 's house , into the scribe 's room : and behold , all the princes were sitting there , Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the son of Achbor , and Gemariah the son of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the princes .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe ; and they told all the words in the ears of the king .
so the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll ; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe . Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king .
it happened , when Jehudi had read three or four leaves , that the king cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier , until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier .
then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the scroll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah : he shall have none to sit on the throne of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the Frost .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , You shall tell the king of Judah , who sent you to me to inquire of me : behold , Pharaoh 's army , which has come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
for though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yes would they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
the princes were angry with Jeremiah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe ; for they had made that the prison .
Shephatiah the son of Mattan , and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur , and Jucal the son of Shelemiah , and Pashhur the son of Malchijah , heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people , saying ,
thus says Yahweh , He who remains in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live , and his life shall be to him for a prey , and he shall live .
then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king 's son , that was in the court of the guard : and they let down Jeremiah with cords . in the dungeon there was no water , but mire ; and Jeremiah sank in the mire .
now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , a eunuch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
my lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he is likely to die in the place where he is , because of the famine ; for there is no more bread in the city .
so Ebedmelech took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took there rags and worn @-@ out garments , and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
so they drew up Jeremiah with the cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard .
but if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and you shall not escape out of their hand .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver you . obey , I beg you , the voice of Yahweh , in that which I speak to you : so it shall be well with you , and your soul shall live .
they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
then came all the princes to Jeremiah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
it happened when Jerusalem was taken , ( in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and besieged it ;
it happened that , when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's garden , through the gate between the two walls ; and he went out toward the Arabah .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath ; and he gave judgment on him .
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city , the deserters also who fell away to him , and the residue of the people who remained .
but Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yahweh ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will surely save you , and you shall not fall by the sword , but your life shall be for a prey to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yahweh .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah , who were carried away captive to Babylon .
now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed to him men , and women , and children , and of the poorest of the land , of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon ;
then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite , they and their men .
as for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah , to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us : but you , gather wine and summer fruits and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that you have taken .
likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab , and among the children of Ammon , and in Edom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan ;
now it happened in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king , and ten men with him , came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah .
then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men who were with him , and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword , and killed him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him , with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans who were found there , the men of war .
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men who were with him .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
now it happened that , when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
then Jeremiah the prophet said to them , I have heard you ; behold , I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words ; and it shall happen that whatever thing Yahweh shall answer you , I will declare it to you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God , to whom we send you ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
if you will still live in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pluck you up ; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you .
Don 't be afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom you are afraid ; don 't be afraid of him , says Yahweh : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
then it shall happen , that the sword , which you fear , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt ; and the famine , about which you are afraid , shall follow close behind you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
so shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there : they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them .
for you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls ; for you sent me to Yahweh your God , saying , pray for us to Yahweh our God ; and according to all that Yahweh our God shall say , so declare to us , and we will do it :
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
it happened that , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God , with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they may put us to death , and carry us away captive to Babylon .
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Judah ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh : and they came to Tahpanhes .
take great stones in your hand , and hide them in mortar in the brick work , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt , who lived at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Memphis , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of Judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
they are not humbled even to this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
for I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods , and all the women who stood by , a great assembly , even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt , in Pathros , answered Jeremiah , saying ,
then Jeremiah said to all the people , to the men , and to the women , even to all the people who had given him an answer , saying ,
so that Yahweh could no longer bear , because of the evil of your doings , and because of the abominations which you have committed ; therefore your land has become a desolation , and an astonishment , and a curse , without inhabitant , as it is this day .
behold , I watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until they are all gone .
the message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah , when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
of Egypt : concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah .
why have I seen it ? they are dismayed and are turned backward ; and their mighty ones are beaten down , and have fled Apace , and don 't look back : terror is on every side , says Yahweh .
the nations have heard of your shame , and the earth is full of your cry ; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty , they are fallen both of them together .
he made many to stumble , yes , they fell one on another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our birth , from the oppressing sword .
also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall ; for they also are turned back , they are fled away together , they didn 't stand : for the day of their calamity has come on them , the time of their visitation .
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants ; and afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , says Yahweh .
but don 't you be afraid , Jacob my servant , neither be dismayed , Israel : for , behold , I will save you from afar , and your seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and shall be quiet and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones , at the rushing of his chariots , at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers don 't look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
for by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up ; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction .
Moab has been at ease from his youth , and he has settled on his lees , and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither has he gone into captivity : therefore his taste remains in him , and his scent is not changed .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will send to him those who pour off , and they shall pour him off ; and they shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles in pieces .
with more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for you , vine of Sibmah : your branches passed over the sea , they reached even to the sea of Jazer : on your summer fruits and on your vintage the destroyer is fallen .
he who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring on him , even on Moab , the year of their visitation , says Yahweh .
those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon ; for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon , and a flame from the midst of Sihon , and has devoured the corner of Moab , and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones .
behold , I will bring a fear on you , says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , from all who are around you ; and you shall be driven out every man right forth , and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives .
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neighbors ; and he is no more .
for thus says Yahweh : behold , they to whom it didn 't pertain to drink of the cup shall certainly drink ; and are you he who shall altogether go unpunished ? you shall not go unpunished , but you shall surely drink .
therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh , that he has taken against Edom ; and his purposes , that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : surely they shall drag them away , the little ones of the flock ; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread out his wings against Bozrah : and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
their camels shall be a booty , and the multitude of their livestock a spoil : and I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their beards cut off ; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them , says Yahweh .
on Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come .
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
your mother shall be utterly disappointed ; she who bore you shall be confounded : behold , she shall be the least of the nations , a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
in those days , and in that time , says Yahweh , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Judah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant .
I have laid a snare for you , and you are also taken , Babylon , and you weren 't aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have striven against Yahweh .
Yahweh has opened his armory , and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation ; for the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans .
the voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God , the vengeance of his temple .
a sword is on their horses , and on their chariots , and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is on her treasures , and they shall be robbed .
therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there , and the ostriches shall dwell therein : and it shall be no more inhabited forever ; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation .
they lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roars like the sea ; and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Babylon .
therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh , that he has taken against Babylon ; and his purposes , that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans : surely they shall drag them away , even the little ones of the flock ; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them .
against him who bends let the archer bend his bow , and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail : and don 't spare her young men ; utterly destroy all her army .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don 't be cut off in her iniquity : for it is the time of Yahweh 's vengeance ; he will render to her a recompense .
make sharp the arrows ; hold firm the shields : Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes ; because his purpose is against Babylon , to destroy it : for it is the vengeance of Yahweh , the vengeance of his temple .
when he utters his voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens , and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he makes lightning for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries .
and with you will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock ; and with you will I break in pieces the farmer and his yoke ; and with you will I break in pieces governors and deputies .
the mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight , they remain in their strongholds ; their might has failed ; they are become as women : her dwelling places are set on fire ; her bars are broken .
her cities are become a desolation , a dry land , and a desert , a land in which no man dwells , neither does any son of man pass thereby .
I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon , and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up ; and the nations shall not flow any more to him : yes , the wall of Babylon shall fall .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be confounded ; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
it shall be , when you have made an end of reading this book , that you shall bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates :
for through the anger of Yahweh it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and encamped against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem :
and he burned the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people , and the residue of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Babylon , and the residue of the multitude .
the Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
the captain of the guard took away the cups , the fire pans , the basins , the pots , the lampstands , the spoons , and the bowls ; that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
they took the two pillars , the one sea , and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh . the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
a capital of brass was on it ; and the height of the one capital was five cubits , with network and pomegranates on the capital all around , all of brass : and the second pillar also had like these , and pomegranates .
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty @-@ five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she weeps bitterly in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they are become her enemies .
the adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary , concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly .
from on high has he sent fire into my bones , and it prevails against them ; He has spread a net for my feet , he has turned me back : he has made me desolate and faint all the day .
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand ; They are knit together , they have come up on my neck ; he has made my strength to fail : the Lord has delivered me into their hands , against whom I am not able to stand .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger ! he has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel , And hasn 't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger .
the Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob , and has not pitied : he has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah ; He has brought them down to the ground ; he has profaned the kingdom and its princes .
he has bent his bow like an enemy , he has stood with his right hand as an adversary , Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye : in the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like fire .
the Lord has become as an enemy , he has swallowed up Israel ; He has swallowed up all her palaces , he has destroyed his strongholds ; He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
the Lord has cast off his altar , he has abhorred his sanctuary ; He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces : they have made a noise in the house of Yahweh , as in the day of a solemn assembly .
the elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground , they keep silence ; They have cast up dust on their heads ; they have clothed themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
my eyes do fail with tears , my heart is troubled ; My liver is poured on the earth , because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , Because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city .
Yahweh has done that which he purposed ; he has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old ; He has thrown down , and has not pitied : he has caused the enemy to rejoice over you ; he has exalted the Horn of your adversaries .
their heart cried to the Lord : Wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night ; Give yourself no respite ; don 't let the apple of your eye cease .
arise , cry out in the night , at the beginning of the watches ; pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children , that faint for hunger at the head of every street .
look , Yahweh , and see to whom you have done thus ! shall the women eat their fruit , the children that are dandled in the hands ? shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword : you have killed them in the day of your anger ; you have slaughtered , and not pitied .
the tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these pine away , stricken through , for want of the fruits of the field .
the kings of the earth didn 't believe , neither all the inhabitants of the world , That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem .
the anger of Yahweh has scattered them ; he will no more regard them : they didn 't respect the persons of the priests , they didn 't favor the elders .
rejoice and be glad , daughter of Edom , that dwell in the land of Uz : the cup shall pass through to you also ; you shall be drunken , and shall make yourself naked .
now it happened in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
out of its midst came the likeness of four living creatures . this was their appearance : they had the likeness of a man .
their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot ; and they sparkled like burnished brass .
as for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , like the appearance of torches : the fire went up and down among the living creatures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
wherever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the wheels were lifted up beside them ; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up beside them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
under the expanse were their wings straight , the one toward the other : each one had two which covered on this side , and every one had two which covered on that side , their bodies .
when they went , I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters , like the voice of the Almighty , a noise of tumult like the noise of an army : when they stood , they let down their wings .
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above .
I saw as it were glowing metal , as the appearance of fire within it all around , from the appearance of his waist and upward ; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and there was brightness around him .
they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear , ( for they are a rebellious house ) , yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them .
not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . surely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another , and the noise of the wheels beside them , even the noise of a great rushing .
so the Spirit lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and behold , the glory of Yahweh stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell on my face .
but you , son of man , behold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bind you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a reprover ; for they are a rebellious house .
but when I speak with you , I will open your mouth , and you shall tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : he who hears , let him hear ; and he who forbears , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
and lay siege against it , and build forts against it , and cast up a mound against it ; set camps also against it , and plant battering rams against it all around .
moreover lie on your left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it ; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it , you shall bear their iniquity .
for I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days , even three hundred ninety days : so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
you , son of man , take a sharp sword ; You shall take it as a Barber 's razor to you , and shall cause it to pass on your head and on your beard : then take balances to weigh , and divide the hair .
of these again you shall take , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations , and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ordinances , and as for my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you are turbulent more than the nations that are around you , and have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept my ordinances , neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you ;
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter to all the winds .
therefore as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely , because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things , and with all your abominations , therefore will I also diminish you ; neither shall my eye spare , and I also will have no pity .
when I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine , that are for destruction , which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine on you , and will break your staff of bread ;
and say , You mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord Yahweh : thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills , to the watercourses and to the valleys : behold , I , even I , will bring a sword on you , and I will destroy your high places .
he who is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
my eye shall not spare you , neither will I have pity ; but I will bring your ways on you , and your abominations shall be in the midst of you : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your abominations shall be in the midst of you ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , do strike .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
but those of those who escape shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them moaning , every one in his iniquity .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty ; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing .
therefore I will bring the worst of the nations , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pride of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be profaned .
it happened in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in my house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell there on me .
then I saw , and behold , a likeness as the appearance of fire ; from the appearance of his waist and downward , fire ; and from his waist and upward , as the appearance of brightness , as it were glowing metal .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel ; and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , every man with his censer in his hand ; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up .
he brought me into the inner court of Yahweh 's house ; and see , at the door of Yahweh 's temple , between the porch and the altar , were about twenty @-@ five men , with their backs toward Yahweh 's temple , and their faces toward the east ; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east .
therefore will I also deal in wrath ; my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity ; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clothed in linen , who had the writer 's inkhorn by his side .
Yahweh said to him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in its midst .
then I looked , and see , in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
the glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh 's glory .
the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen , who took it and went out .
I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the cherubim , one wheel beside one cherub , and another wheel beside another cherub ; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone .
their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes all around , even the wheels that the four of them had .
the cherubim lifted up their wings , and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth , and the wheels beside them : and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh 's house ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
as for the likeness of their faces , they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar , their appearances and themselves ; they went every one straight forward .
and you shall know that I am Yahweh : for you have not walked in my statutes , neither have you executed my ordinances , but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you .
I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them a heart of flesh ;
the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city , and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
the Spirit lifted me up , and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
son of man , you dwell in the midst of the rebellious house , who have eyes to see , and don 't see , who have ears to hear , and don 't hear ; for they are a rebellious house .
in their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder , and carry it forth in the dark ; you shall cover your face , so that you don 't see the land : for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel .
I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my stuff by day , as stuff for removing , and in the even I dug through the wall with my hand ; I brought it forth in the dark , and bore it on my shoulder in their sight .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my snare ; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
you have not gone up into the gaps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yahweh .
behold , when the wall has fallen , shall it not be said to you , Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it ?
so will I break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consumed in its midst : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , and be saved alive :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him an astonishment , for a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
behold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less , when the fire has devoured it , and it is burned , shall it yet be meet for any work !
as for your birth , in the day you were born your navel was not cut , neither were you washed in water to cleanse you ; you weren 't salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
no eye pitied you , to do any of these things to you , to have compassion on you ; but you were cast out in the open field , for that your person was abhorred , in the day that you were born .
I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field , and you increased and grew great , and you attained to excellent ornament ; your breasts were fashioned , and your hair was grown ; yet you were naked and bare .
thus you were decked with gold and silver ; and your clothing was of fine linen , and silk , and embroidered work ; you ate fine flour , and honey , and oil ; and you were exceeding beautiful , and you prospered to royal estate .
you took of your garments , and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors , and played the prostitute on them : [ the like things ] shall not come , neither shall it be [ so ] .
you also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yourself images of men , and played the prostitute with them ;
my bread also which I gave you , fine flour , and oil , and honey , with which I fed you , you even set it before them for a pleasant aroma ; and [ thus ] it was , says the Lord Yahweh .
that you have slain my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through [ the fire ] to them ?
you have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians , your neighbors , great of flesh ; and have multiplied your prostitution , to provoke me to anger .
thus says the Lord Yahweh , Because your filthiness was poured out , and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers ; and because of all the idols of your abominations , and for the blood of your children , that you gave to them ;
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your vaulted place , and break down your lofty places ; and they shall strip you of your clothes , and take your beautiful jewels ; and they shall leave you naked and bare .
they shall burn your houses with fire , and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute , and you shall also give no hire any more .
so will I cause my wrath toward you to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from you , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
you are the daughter of your mother , who loathes her husband and her children ; and you are the sister of your sisters , who loathed their husbands and their children : your mother was a Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
your elder sister is Samaria , who dwells at your left hand , she and her daughters ; and your younger sister , who dwells at your right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
yet have you not walked in their ways , nor done after their abominations ; but , as [ if that were ] a very little [ thing ] , you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
I will turn again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , and the captivity of your captives in their midst ;
that you may bear your own shame , and may be ashamed because of all that you have done , in that you are a comfort to them .
your sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate ; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate ; and you and your daughters shall return to your former estate .
then you shall remember your ways , and be ashamed , when you shall receive your sisters , your elder [ sisters ] and your younger ; and I will give them to you for daughters , but not by your Covenant .
that you may remember , and be confounded , and never open your mouth any more , because of your shame , when I have forgiven you all that you have done , says the Lord Yahweh .
he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it , and carried it to a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of merchants .
it was planted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose Covenant he broke , even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
I will spread my net on him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me .
all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword , and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it ; and it shall bring forth boughs , and bear fruit , and be a goodly cedar : and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing ; in the shade of its branches shall they dwell .
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has defiled his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her impurity ,
and has not wronged any , but has restored to the debtor his pledge , has taken nothing by robbery , has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
neither has wronged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ordinances , has walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
they put him in a cage with hooks , and brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into strongholds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
it happened in the seventh year , in the fifth [ month ] , the tenth [ day ] of the month , that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Yahweh , and sat before me .
son of man , speak to the elders of Israel , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : is it to inquire of me that you have come ? as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , I will not be inquired of by you .
and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the day when I chose Israel , and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob , and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt , when I swore to them , saying , I am Yahweh your God ;
in that day I swore to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
I said to their children in the wilderness , Don 't walk in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their ordinances , nor defile yourselves with their idols .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with wrath poured out , will I be king over you :
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with wrath poured out ;
like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I enter into judgment with you , says the Lord Yahweh .
and I will purge out from among you the rebels , and those who disobey against me ; I will bring them forth out of the land where they live , but they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
for in my holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them , serve me in the land : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offerings , and the first fruits of your offerings , with all your holy things .
as a pleasant aroma will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered ; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations .
there you shall remember your ways , and all your doings , in which you have polluted yourselves ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed .
son of man , set your face toward the south , and drop [ your word ] toward the south , and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South ;
it is given to be furbished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpened , yes , it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
also , you son of man , appoint two ways , that the sword of the king of Babylon may come ; they both shall come forth out of one land : and mark out a place , mark it out at the head of the way to the city .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : remove the turban , and take off the crown ; this [ shall be ] no more the same ; exalt that which is low , and abase that which is high .
cause it to return into its sheath . in the place where you were created , in the land of your birth , will I judge you .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men , skillful to destroy .
in you have they set light by father and mother ; in the midst of you have they dealt by oppression with the foreigner ; in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow .
one has committed abomination with his neighbor 's wife ; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter @-@ in @-@ law ; and another in you has humbled his sister , his father 's daughter .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
there is a conspiracy of her prophets in its midst , like a roaring lion ravening the prey : they have devoured souls ; they take treasure and precious things ; they have made her widows many in its midst .
and they played the prostitute in Egypt ; they played the prostitute in their youth ; there were their breasts pressed , and there was handled the bosom of their virginity .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bosom of her virginity ; and they poured out their prostitution on her .
thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate , into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated ;
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
for they have committed adultery , and blood is in their hands ; and with their idols have they committed adultery ; and they have also caused their sons , whom they bore to me , to pass through [ the fire ] to them to be devoured .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall kill their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
take the choice of the flock , and also a pile [ of wood ] for the bones under [ the caldron ] ; make it boil well ; yes , let its bones be boiled in its midst .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : Woe to the bloody city , to the caldron whose rust is therein , and whose rust is not gone out of it ! take out of it piece after piece ; No lot is fallen on it .
then set it empty on its coals , that it may be hot , and its brass may burn , and that its filthiness may be molten in it , that its rust may be consumed .
she has wearied [ herself ] with toil ; yet her great rust doesn 't go forth out of her ; her rust doesn 't [ go forth ] by fire .
in your filthiness is lewdness : because I have cleansed you and you weren 't cleansed , you shall not be cleansed from your filthiness any more , until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest .
therefore , behold , I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their encampments in you , and make their dwellings in you ; they shall eat your fruit , and they shall drink your milk .
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth Jeshimoth , Baal Meon , and Kiriathaim ,
to the children of the east , [ to go ] against the children of Ammon ; and I will give them for a possession , that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations .
she shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh ; and she shall become a spoil to the nations .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , king of kings , from the north , with horses , and with chariots , and with horsemen , and a company , and many people .
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the sword ; and the pillars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
they shall make a spoil of your riches , and make a prey of your merchandise ; and they shall break down your walls , and destroy your pleasant houses ; and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the waters .
then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones , and lay aside their robes , and strip off their embroidered garments : they shall clothe themselves with trembling ; they shall sit on the ground , and shall tremble every moment , and be astonished at you .
the old men of Gebal and the wise men of it were in you your repairers of ship seams : all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to deal in your merchandise .
Arabia , and all the princes of Kedar , they were the merchants of your hand ; in lambs , and rams , and goats , in these were they your merchants .
all who handled the oar , the mariners , [ and ] all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
and shall cause their voice to be heard over you , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust on their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you , and lament over you , [ saying ] , Who is there like Tyre , like her who is brought to silence in the midst of the sea ?
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall defile your brightness .
they shall bring you down to the pit ; and you shall die the death of those who are slain , in the heart of the seas .
you were the anointed cherub who covers : and I set you , [ so that ] you were on the holy mountain of God ; you have walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
your heart was lifted up because of your beauty ; you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness : I have cast you to the ground ; I have laid you before kings , that they may see you .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : when I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered , and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations , then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob .
they shall dwell securely therein ; yes , they shall build houses , and plant vineyards , and shall dwell securely , when I have executed judgments on all those who do them despite all around them ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh their God .
I will put hooks in your jaws , and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales ; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers , with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales .
I 'll cast you forth into the wilderness , you and all the fish of your rivers . you 'll fall on the open field . you won 't be brought together , nor gathered . I have given you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds of the sky .
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and tore all their shoulders ; and when they leaned on you , you broke , and paralyzed all of their thighs . "
therefore , behold , I am against you , and against your rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation , from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia .
I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate ; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years ; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries . "
and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the base of the kingdoms ; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations : and I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall carry off her multitude , and take her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
in that day will I cause a Horn to bud forth to the house of Israel , and I will give you the opening of the mouth in their midst ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
Ethiopia , and Put , and Lud , and all the mixed people , and Cub , and the children of the land that is allied with them , shall fall with them by the sword .
in that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid ; and there shall be anguish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , behold , it comes .
I will make the rivers dry , and will sell the land into the hand of evil men ; and I will make the land desolate , and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers : I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will also destroy the idols , and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis ; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
at Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself , when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt , and the pride of her power shall cease in her : as for her , a cloud shall cover her , and her daughters shall go into captivity .
it happened in the eleventh year , in the first [ month ] , in the seventh [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and behold , it has not been bound up , to apply [ healing ] medicines , to put a bandage to bind it , that it be strong to hold the sword .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong [ arm ] , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but I will break the arms of Pharaoh , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field ; and its boughs were multiplied , and its branches became long by reason of many waters , when it shot [ them ] forth .
all the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations ; he shall surely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his wickedness .
Strangers , the terrible of the nations , have cut him off , and have left him : on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen , and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land ; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow , and have left him .
they also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the midst of the nations .
it happened in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
I will leave you on the land , I will cast you forth on the open field , and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you , and I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you .
I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim , even to the mountains ; and the watercourses shall be full of you .
when I shall extinguish you , I will cover the heavens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give its light .
by the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall ; the terrible of the nations are they all : and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt , and all its multitude shall be destroyed .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste , a land destitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who dwell therein , then shall they know that I am Yahweh .
son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , to the lower parts of the earth , with those who go down into the pit .
whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit , and her company is around her grave ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Edom , her kings and all her princes , who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with those who go down to the pit .
for I have put his terror in the land of the living ; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised , with those who are slain by the sword , even Pharaoh and all his multitude , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , speak to the children of your people , and tell them , When I bring the sword on a land , and the people of the land take a man from among them , and set him for their watchman ;
nevertheless , if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it , and he doesn 't turn from his way ; he shall die in his iniquity , but you have delivered your soul .
when I tell the righteous , that he shall surely live ; if he trust to his righteousness , and commit iniquity , none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered ; but in his iniquity that he has committed , therein shall he die .
if the wicked restore the pledge , give again that which he had taken by robbery , walk in the statutes of life , committing no iniquity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
it happened in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth [ month ] , in the fifth [ day ] of the month , that one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me , saying , The city has been struck .
I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment ; and the pride of her power shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , so that none shall pass through .
behold , you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear your words , but they don 't do them .
you haven 't strengthened the diseased , neither have you healed that which was sick , neither have you bound up that which was broken , neither have you brought back that which was driven away , neither have you sought that which was lost ; but with force and with rigor you have ruled over them .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely because my sheep became a prey , and my sheep became food to all the animals of the field , because there was no shepherd , neither did my shepherds search for my sheep , but the shepherds fed themselves , and didn 't feed my sheep ;
I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land ; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel , by the watercourses , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them with good pasture ; and on the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie down in a good fold ; and on fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel .
I will seek that which was lost , and will bring back that which was driven away , and will bind up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was sick : but the fat and the strong I will destroy ; I will feed them in justice .
does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture , but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture ? and to have drunk of the clear waters , but you must foul the residue with your feet ?
as for my sheep , they eat that which you have trodden with your feet , and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet .
I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
they shall no more be a prey to the nations , neither shall the animals of the earth devour them ; but they shall dwell securely , and none shall make them afraid .
I will raise up to them a plantation for renown , and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land , neither bear the shame of the nations any more .
because you have had a perpetual enmity , and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time of the iniquity of the end ;
I will fill its mountains with its slain : in your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses shall they fall who are slain with the sword .
neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations , neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
I will also give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you a heart of flesh .
then you shall remember your evil ways , and your doings that were not good ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh , and set me down in the midst of the valley ; and it was full of bones .
therefore prophesy , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , my people ; and I will bring you into the land of Israel .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
you , son of man , take one stick , and write on it , For Judah , and for the children of Israel his companions : then take another stick , and write on it , For Joseph , the stick of Ephraim , and [ for ] all the house of Israel his companions :
say to them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the nations , where they are gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all ;
they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant , in which your fathers lived ; and they shall dwell therein , they , and their children , and their children 's children , forever : and David my servant shall be their prince for ever .
you shall come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north , you , and many peoples with you , all of them riding on horses , a great company and a mighty army ;
it shall happen in that day , when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils .
with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him ; and I will rain on him , and on his hordes , and on the many peoples who are with him , an overflowing shower , and great hailstones , fire , and sulfur .
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
you shall fall on the mountains of Israel , you , and all your hordes , and the peoples who are with you : I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort , and to the animals of the field to be devoured .
my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel ; neither will I allow my holy name to be profaned any more : and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh , the Holy One in Israel .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall make fires of the weapons ; and they shall plunder those who plundered them , and rob those who robbed them , says the Lord Yahweh .
those who pass through the land shall pass through ; and when any sees a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , until the undertakers have buried it in the valley of Hamon Gog .
the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity ; because they trespassed against me , and I hid my face from them : so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries , and they fell all of them by the sword .
they shall bear their shame , and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me , when they shall dwell securely in their land , and none shall make them afraid ;
they shall know that I am Yahweh their God , in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations , and have gathered them to their own land ; and I will leave none of them any more there ;
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck , in the same day , the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me there .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me down on a very high mountain , whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south .
he brought me there ; and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring Reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he measured the threshold of the gate , one Reed broad ; and the other threshold , one Reed broad .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and its posts , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was toward the house .
and a border before the lodges , one cubit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cubit on that side ; and the lodges , six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
[ from ] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside , one hundred cubits , [ both ] on the east and on the north .
the lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate : its length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty @-@ five cubits .
the windows of it , and its arches , and the palm trees of it , were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and its arches were before them .
there were seven steps to go up to it , and its arches were before them ; and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , on its posts .
the arches of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
on the [ one ] side outside , as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north , were two tables ; and on the other side , which belonged to the porch of the gate , were two tables .
outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south ; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the duty of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok , who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him .
then he brought me to the porch of the house , and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tent .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits all around .
he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back , and its galleries on the one side and on the other side , one hundred cubits ; and the inner temple , and the porches of the court ;
the thresholds , and the closed windows , and the galleries around on their three stories , over against the threshold , with wood ceilings all around , and [ from ] the ground up to the windows , ( now the windows were covered ) ,
so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side . [ thus was it ] made through all the house all around :
as for the temple , the door posts were squared ; and as for the face of the sanctuary , the appearance [ of it ] was as the appearance [ of the temple ] .
the doors had two leaves [ apiece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubim and palm trees , like as were made on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
over against the twenty [ cubits ] which belonged to the inner court , and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court , was gallery against gallery in the third story .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it all around .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the earth shined with his glory .
it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city ; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell on my face .
in their setting of their threshold by my threshold , and their doorpost beside my doorpost , and there was [ but ] the wall between me and them ; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed : therefore I have consumed them in my anger .
the ledge shall be fourteen [ cubits ] long by fourteen broad in the four sides of it ; and the border about it shall be half a cubit ; and its bottom shall be a cubit around ; and its steps shall look toward the east .
you shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yahweh , a young bull for a sin offering .
you shall take of its blood , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the ledge , and on the border all around : thus you shall cleanse it and make Atonement for it .
as for the prince , he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Yahweh ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh : and I fell on my face .
in that you have brought in foreigners , uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in my sanctuary , to profane it , even my house , when you offer my bread , the fat and the blood , and they have broken my Covenant , [ to add ] to all your abominations .
because they ministered to them before their idols , and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel ; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them , says the Lord Yahweh , and they shall bear their iniquity .
they shall not come near to me , to execute the office of priest to me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , to the things that are most holy ; but they shall bear their shame , and their abominations which they have committed .
it shall be that , when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linen garments ; and no wool shall come on them , while they minister in the gates of the inner court , and within .
they shall have linen tires on their heads , and shall have linen breeches on their waists ; they shall not clothe themselves with [ anything that causes ] sweat .
neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her who is put away ; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow who is the widow of a priest .
they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves ; but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister who has had no husband , they may defile themselves .
the first of all the first fruits of every thing , and every offering of everything , of all your offerings , shall be for the priest : you shall also give to the priests the first of your dough , to cause a blessing to rest on your house .
moreover , when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance , you shall offer an offering to Yahweh , a holy portion of the land ; the length shall be the length of twenty @-@ five thousand [ reeds ] , and the breadth shall be ten thousand : it shall be holy in all its border all around .
it is a holy portion of the land ; it shall be for the priests , the ministers of the sanctuary , who come near to minister to Yahweh ; and it shall be a place for their houses , and a holy place for the sanctuary .
and the set portion of oil , of the bath of oil , the tenth part of a bath out of the Cor , [ which is ] ten baths , even a Homer ; ( for ten baths are a Homer ; )
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bull without blemish ; and you shall cleanse the sanctuary .
the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it on the door posts of the house , and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar , and on the posts of the gate of the inner court .
in the seventh [ month ] , in the fifteenth day of the month , in the feast , shall he do the like the seven days ; according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meal offering , and according to the oil .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : the gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened , and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram ; they shall be without blemish :
when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate , and he shall go forth by its way .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part westward .
then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward , and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate , by the way of [ the gate ] that looks toward the east ; and behold , there ran out waters on the right side .
again he measured one thousand , and caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the knees . again he measured one thousand , and caused me to pass through [ the waters ] , waters that were to the waist .
it shall happen , that fishermen shall stand by it : from En Gedi even to En Eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets ; their fish shall be after their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
these shall be its measures : the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
the city shall have suburbs : toward the north two hundred fifty , and toward the south two hundred fifty , and toward the east two hundred fifty , and toward the west two hundred fifty .
moreover from the possession of the Levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , it shall be for the prince .
by the border of Gad , at the south side southward , the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh , to the Brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea .
at the east side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , and three gates : even the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Issachar , one ; the gate of Zebulun , one .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , with their three gates : the gate of Gad , one ; the gate of Asher , one ; the gate of Naphtali , one .
the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God ; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god : and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's dainties , and of the wine which he drank , and that they should be nourished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
the prince of the eunuchs gave names to them : to Daniel he gave [ the name of ] Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , [ of ] Shadrach ; and to Mishael , [ of ] Meshach ; and to Azariah , [ of ] Abednego .
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the youths who eat of the king 's dainties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the enchanters , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , to tell the king his dreams . so they came in and stood before the king .
therefore Daniel went in to Arioch , whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon ; he went and said thus to him : Don 't destroy the wise men of Babylon ; bring me in before the king , and I will show to the king the interpretation .
then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste , and said thus to him , I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah , who will make known to the king the interpretation .
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for you , O king , your thoughts came [ into your mind ] on your bed , what should happen hereafter ; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen .
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its breast and its arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of brass ,
and wherever the children of men dwell , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
therefore at that time , when all the peoples heard the sound of the Horn , flute , zither , Lyre , harp , pipe , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego : [ therefore ] he spoke , and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated .
then these men were bound in their pants , their tunics , and their mantles , and their [ other ] garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpretation .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and I told the dream before him , [ saying ] ,
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth ; and its height was great .
the leaves of it were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all : the animals of the field had shadow under it , and the birds of the sky lived in its branches , and all flesh was fed from it .
nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky : and let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth :
whose leaves were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all ; under which the animals of the field lived , and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habitation :
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : the kingdom has departed from you :
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God 's house which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , drank from them .
in the same hour came forth the fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his thoughts troubled him ; and the joints of his thighs were loosened , and his knees struck one against another .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . the king spoke and said to Daniel , Are you that Daniel , who are of the children of the captivity of Judah , whom the king my father brought out of Judah ?
now the wise men , the enchanters , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known to me its interpretation ; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing .
and because of the greatness that he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages trembled and feared before him : whom he would he killed , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
but when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with purple , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
then answered they and said before the king , That Daniel , who is of the children of the captivity of Judah , doesn 't respect you , O king , nor the decree that you have signed , but makes his petition three times a day .
then the king , when he heard these words , was very displeased , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sleep fled from him .
then was the king exceeding glad , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had trusted in his God .
I make a decree , that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel ; for he is the living God , and steadfast forever , His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed ; and his dominion shall be even to the end .
the first was like a lion , and had eagle 's wings : I saw until its wings were plucked , and it was lifted up from the earth , and made to stand on two feet as a man ; and a man 's heart was given to it .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the Horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was slain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
I saw in the night visions , and behold , there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man , and he came even to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
as for the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
I saw in the vision ; now it was so , that when I saw , I was in the citadel of Susa , which is in the province of Elam ; and I saw in the vision , and I was by the river Ulai .
then I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
as I was considering , behold , a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth , and didn 't touch the ground : and the goat had a notable Horn between his eyes .
he came to the ram that had the two horns , which I saw standing before the river , and ran on him in the fury of his power .
yes , it magnified itself , even to the prince of the army ; and it took away from him the continual [ burnt offering ] , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
the army was given over [ to it ] together with the continual [ burnt offering ] through disobedience ; and it cast down truth to the ground , and it did [ its pleasure ] and prospered .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
so he came near where I stood ; and when he came , I was frightened , and fell on my face : but he said to me , understand , son of man ; for the vision belongs to the time of the end .
his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper and do [ his pleasure ] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magnify himself in his heart , and in [ their ] security shall he destroy many : he shall also stand up against the prince of princes ; but he shall be broken without hand .
neither have we listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
as it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil has come on us : yet have we not entreated the favor of Yahweh our God , that we should turn from our iniquities , and have discernment in your truth .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
my God , turn your ear , and hear ; open your eyes , and see our desolations , and the city which is called by your name : for we do not present our petitions before you for our righteousness , but for your great mercies ' sake .
yes , while I was speaking in prayer , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
I , Daniel , alone saw the vision ; for the men who were with me didn 't see the vision ; but a great quaking fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty @-@ one days ; but , behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there breath left in me .
the king of the south shall be strong , and [ one ] of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
but out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place , who shall come to the army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prevail .
also their gods , with their molten images , [ and ] with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold , shall he carry captive into Egypt ; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north .
the king of the south shall be moved with anger , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north ; and he shall set forth a great multitude , and the multitude shall be given into his hand .
the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former ; and he shall come on at the end of the times , [ even of ] years , with a great army and with much substance .
after this shall he turn his face to the islands , and shall take many : but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ; yes , moreover , he shall cause his reproach to turn on him .
then shall stand up in his place one who shall cause a tax collector to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory ; but within few days he shall be destroyed , neither in anger , nor in battle .
in his place shall stand up a contemptible person , to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom : but he shall come in time of security , and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy Covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
for ships of Kittim shall come against him ; therefore he shall be grieved , and shall return , and have indignation against the holy Covenant , and shall do [ his pleasure ] : he shall even return , and have regard to those who forsake the holy Covenant .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall profane the sanctuary , even the fortress , and shall take away the continual [ burnt offering ] , and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many [ countries ] shall be overthrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt ; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
then I , Daniel , looked , and behold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
from the time that the continual burnt offering shall be taken away , and the abomination that makes desolate set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days .
the word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea , which can 't be measured nor numbered ; and it will come to pass that , in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' they will be called ' sons of the living God . '
the children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together , and they will appoint themselves one head , and will go up from the land ; for great will be the day of Jezreel .
Lest I strip her naked , and make her bare as in the day that she was born , and make her like a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and kill her with thirst .
I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees , about which she has said , ' These are my wages that my lovers have given me ; and I will make them a forest , ' and the animals of the field shall eat them .
I will visit on her the days of the Baals , to which she burned incense , when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and went after her lovers , and forgot me , " says Yahweh .
I will give her vineyards from there , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
I will sow her to me in the earth ; and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy ; and I will tell those who were not my people , ' You are my people ; ' and they will say , ' My God ! ' "
therefore the land will mourn , and everyone who dwells therein will waste away. all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute , nor your brides when they commit adultery ; because the men consort with prostitutes , and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes ; so the people without understanding will come to ruin .
Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke . among the tribes of Israel , I have made known that which will surely be .
for I will be to Ephraim like a lion , and like a young lion to the house of Judah . I myself will tear in pieces and go away . I will carry off , and there will be no one to deliver .
let us acknowledge Yahweh . let us press on to know Yahweh . as surely as the sun rises , Yahweh will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the earth . "
Strangers have devoured his strength , and he doesn 't realize it . indeed , gray hairs are here and there on him , and he doesn 't realize it .

and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
for if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree , and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree , how much more will these , which are the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
be of the same mind one toward another . Don 't set your mind on high things , but associate with the humble . Don 't be wise in your own conceits .
therefore " If your enemy is hungry , feed him . if he is thirsty , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will heap coals of fire on his head . "
for rulers are not a terror to the good work , but to the evil . do you desire to have no fear of the authority ? do that which is good , and you will have praise from the same ,
he who observes the day , observes it to the Lord ; and he who does not observe the day , to the Lord he does not observe it . he who eats , eats to the Lord , for he gives God thanks . he who doesn 't eat , to the Lord he doesn 't eat , and gives God thanks .
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
I know that , when I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ .
that you receive her in the Lord , in a way worthy of the saints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she herself also has been a helper of many , and of my own self .
for your obedience has become known to all . I rejoice therefore over you . but I desire to have you wise in that which is good , but innocent in that which is evil .
now I beg you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Chloe 's household , that there are contentions among you .
for seeing that in the wisdom of God , the world through its wisdom didn 't know God , it was God 's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe .
but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to shame the things that are strong ;
and God chose the lowly things of the world , and the things that are despised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spirit .
but we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don 't judge my own self .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you didn 't receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sanctified . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
Don 't you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them members of a prostitute ? May it never be !
Don 't deprive one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer , and may be together again , that Satan doesn 't tempt you because of your lack of self @-@ control .
( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
I think that it is good therefore , because of the distress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
but food will not commend us to God . for neither , if we don 't eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a vineyard , and doesn 't eat of its fruit ? or who feeds a flock , and doesn 't drink from the flock 's milk ?
Don 't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple , and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar ?
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
the cup of blessing which we bless , isn 't it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , isn 't it a sharing of the body of Christ ?
you can 't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . you can 't both partake of the table of the Lord , and of the table of demons .
but if anyone says to you , " This was offered to idols , " don 't eat it for the sake of the one who told you , and for the sake of conscience . for " the earth is the Lord 's , and all its fullness . "
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
love never fails . but where there are prophecies , they will be done away with . where there are various languages , they will cease . where there is knowledge , it will be done away with .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away childish things .
now I desire to have you all speak with other languages , but rather that you would prophesy . for he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages , unless he interprets , that the assembly may be built up .
what is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
if any man thinks himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him recognize the things which I write to you , that they are the commandment of the Lord .
Paul , an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia :
who comforts us in all our affliction , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
for our boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in holiness and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you .
and I wrote this very thing to you , so that , when I came , I wouldn 't have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy would be shared by all of you .
for out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears , not that you should be made sorry , but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you .
so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him , lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow .
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel wouldn 't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away .
but we have renounced the hidden things of shame , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
while we don 't look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
for we are not commending ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance , and not in heart .
for he says , " At an acceptable time I listened to you , in a day of salvation I helped you . " behold , now is the acceptable time . behold , now is the day of salvation .
so although I wrote to you , I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered the wrong , but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God .
for if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf , I was not disappointed . but as we spoke all things to you in truth , so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth .
but I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect , that , just as I said , you may be prepared ,
seeing that through the proof given by this service , they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ , and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all ;
do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face ? if anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ 's , let him consider this again with himself , that , even as he is Christ 's , so also we are Christ 's .
for though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be disappointed ,
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they boast , they may be found even as we .
for you bear with a man , if he brings you into bondage , if he devours you , if he takes you captive , if he exalts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
for if I would desire to boast , I will not be foolish ; for I will speak the truth . but I refrain , so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me , or hears from me .
by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations , that I should not be exalted excessively , there was given to me a Thorn in the flesh , a messenger of Satan to torment me , that I should not be exalted excessively .
for what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this wrong .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don 't you know as to your own selves , that Jesus Christ is in you ? --unless indeed you are disqualified .
but from those who were reputed to be important ( whatever they were , it makes no difference to me ; God doesn 't show partiality to man ) --they , I say , who were respected imparted nothing to me ,
for as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse . for it is written , " Cursed is everyone who doesn 't continue in all things that are written in the book of the law , to do them . "
so then , as we have opportunity , let 's do what is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
to an administration of the fullness of the times , to sum up all things in Christ , the things in the heavens , and the things on the earth , in him ;
in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Good News of your salvation--in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise ,
that you were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
of which I was made a servant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
until we all attain to the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a full grown man , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ;
from whom all the body , being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
being darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their hearts ;
for our wrestling is not against flesh and blood , but against the principalities , against the powers , against the world 's rulers of the darkness of this age , and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places .
but if I live on in the flesh , this will bring fruit from my work ; yet I don 't know what I will choose .
not that I have already obtained , or am already made perfect ; but I press on , if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus .
nevertheless , to the extent that we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule . let us be of the same mind .
who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
finally , brothers , whatever things are true , whatever things are honorable , whatever things are just , whatever things are pure , whatever things are lovely , whatever things are of good report ; if there is any virtue , and if there is any praise , think about these things .
for this cause , we also , since the day we heard this , don 't cease praying and making requests for you , that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body 's sake , which is the assembly ;
in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ ;
and that our Good News came to you not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spirit , and with much assurance . you know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake .
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
for this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep .
now we command you , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion , and not after the tradition which they received from us .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in labor and travail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
if any man doesn 't obey our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be ashamed .
( but if a man doesn 't know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
if you instruct the brothers of these things , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , nourished in the words of the faith , and of the good doctrine which you have followed .
let no man despise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity .
but the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gentiles might hear ; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
you have put all things in subjection under his feet . " for in that he subjected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . but now we don 't see all things subjected to him , yet .
therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers , that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make Atonement for the sins of the people .
for indeed we have had good news preached to us , even as they also did , but the word they heard didn 't profit them , because it wasn 't mixed with faith by those who heard .
for we who have believed do enter into that rest , even as he has said , " As I swore in my wrath , they will not enter into my rest " ; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
for we don 't have a high priest who can 't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities , but one who has been in all points tempted like we are , yet without sin .
for the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receives blessing from God ;
for God is not unrighteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them .
they indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest 's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brothers , though these have come out of the body of Abraham ,
( for they indeed have been made priests without an oath ) , but he with an oath by him that says of him , " The Lord swore and will not change his mind , ' You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . ' "
" for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel . after those days , " says the Lord ; " I will put my laws into their mind , I will also write them on their heart . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
having a golden altar of incense , and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid on all sides with gold , in which was a golden pot holding the manna , Aaron 's rod that budded , and the tablets of the Covenant ;
for when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the calves and the goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
" this is the Covenant that I will make with them : ' after those days , ' says the Lord , ' I will put my laws on their heart , I will also write them on their mind ; ' " then he says ,
by faith , we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him .
by faith , Abraham , when he was called , obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance . he went out , not knowing where he went .
by faith , he lived as an alien in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , dwelling in tents , with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore , were fathered by one man , and him as good as dead .
by faith , Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
looking to Jesus , the author and perfecter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising its shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
Don 't be carried away by various and strange teachings , for it is good that the heart be established by grace , not by food , through which those who were so occupied were not benefited .
and the tongue is a fire . the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Gehenna .
Don 't speak against one another , brothers . he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . but if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law , but a judge .
behold , the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields , which you have kept back by fraud , cry out , and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Armies .
be patient therefore , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . behold , the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until it receives the early and late rain .
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear :
for to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead , that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh , but live as to God in the spirit .
if you are insulted for the name of Christ , you are blessed ; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you . on their part he is blasphemed , but on your part he is glorified .
for we did not follow cunningly devised fables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
for if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
but the heavens that now are , and the earth , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Word of life
( and the life was revealed , and we have seen , and testify , and declare to you the life , the eternal life , which was with the Father , and was revealed to us ) ;
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fellowship with us . yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ , his Son , cleanses us from all sin .
I write to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you have overcome the evil one . I write to you , little children , because you know the Father .
I have written to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
Don 't love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone loves the world , the Father 's love isn 't in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , isn 't the Father 's , but is the world 's .
they went out from us , but they didn 't belong to us ; for if they had belonged to us , they would have continued with us . but they left , that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the Father .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the devil . whoever doesn 't do righteousness is not of God , neither is he who doesn 't love his brother .
and every spirit who doesn 't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God , and this is the spirit of the Antichrist , of whom you have heard that it comes . now it is in the world already .
we are of God . he who knows God listens to us . he who is not of God doesn 't listen to us . by this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
if a man says , " I love God , " and hates his brother , he is a liar ; for he who doesn 't love his brother whom he has seen , how can he love God whom he has not seen ?
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who doesn 't believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eternal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
we know that the Son of God has come , and has given us an understanding , that we know him who is true , and we are in him who is true , in his Son Jesus Christ . this is the true God , and eternal life .
having many things to write to you , I don 't want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that our joy may be made full .
remember therefore from where you have fallen , and repent and do the first works ; or else I am coming to you swiftly , and will move your lampstand out of its place , unless you repent .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . to him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Paradise of my God .
" I know your works , oppression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
" to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write : " the Son of God , who has his eyes like a flame of fire , and his feet are like burnished brass , says these things :
" and to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write : " he who has the seven spirits of God , and the seven stars says these things : " I know your works , that you have a reputation of being alive , but you are dead .
he who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments , and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life , and I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
" to the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write : " he who is holy , he who is true , he who has the key of David , he who opens and no one can shut , and who shuts and no one opens , says these things :
" I know your works ( behold , I have set before you an open door , which no one can shut ) , that you have a little power , and kept my word , and didn 't deny my name .
behold , I give of the synagogue of Satan , of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but lie . behold , I will make them to come and worship before your feet , and to know that I have loved you .
because you kept my command to endure , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
because you say , ' I am rich , and have gotten riches , and have need of nothing ; ' and don 't know that you are the wretched one , miserable , poor , blind , and naked ;
I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a lamb standing , as though it had been slain , having seven horns , and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God , sent out into all the earth .
now when he had taken the book , the four living creatures and the twenty @-@ four elders fell down before the lamb , each one having a harp , and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
I saw , and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne , the living creatures , and the elders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
when he opened the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God , and for the testimony of the lamb which they had .
a long white robe was given to each of them . they were told that they should rest yet for a while , until their fellow servants and their brothers , who would also be killed even as they were , should complete their course .
the kings of the earth , the princes , the commanding officers , the rich , the strong , and every slave and free person , hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains .
after this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
the first sounded , and there followed hail and fire , mixed with blood , and they were thrown to the earth . one third of the earth was burnt up , and one third of the trees were burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
he opened the pit of the abyss , and smoke went up out of the pit , like the smoke from a burning furnace . the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit .
thus I saw the horses in the vision , and those who sat on them , having breastplates of fiery red , hyacinth blue , and sulfur yellow ; and the heads of lions . out of their mouths proceed fire , smoke , and sulfur .
for the power of the horses is in their mouths , and in their tails . for their tails are like Serpents , and have heads , and with them they harm .
the voice which I heard from heaven , again speaking with me , said , " Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as sweet as honey in my mouth . when I had eaten it , my stomach was made bitter .
leave out the court which is outside of the temple , and don 't measure it , for it has been given to the nations . they will tread the holy city under foot for forty @-@ two months .
from among the peoples , tribes , languages , and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
his tail drew one third of the stars of the sky , and threw them to the earth . the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might devour her child .
the great dragon was thrown down , the old serpent , he who is called the devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman , that she might fly into the wilderness to her place , so that she might be nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
then I stood on the sand of the sea . I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads . on his horns were ten crowns , and on his heads , blasphemous names .
the beast which I saw was like a Leopard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . the dragon gave him his power , his throne , and great authority .
all who dwell on the earth will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb who has been killed .
if anyone is to go into captivity , he will go into captivity . if anyone is to be killed with the sword , he must be killed . here is the endurance and the faith of the saints .
it was given to him to give breath to it , to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause as many as wouldn 't worship the image of the beast to be killed .
he causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the slave , to be given marks on their right hands , or on their foreheads ;
I saw , and behold , the lamb standing on Mount Zion , and with him a number , one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his Father , written on their foreheads .
the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name .
another angel came out from the temple , crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud , " Send forth your sickle , and reap ; for the hour to reap has come ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe ! "
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temple , until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished .
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshiped his image .
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , something like frogs ;
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God , to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
and on her forehead a name was written , " mystery , BABYLON the great , the mother of the prostitutes and of the ABOMINATIONS of the Earth . "
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the prostitute , and will make her desolate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality , the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury . "
the light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you . the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you ; for your merchants were the princes of the earth ; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived .
for true and righteous are his judgments . for he has judged the great prostitute , who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality , and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad , and let us give the glory to him . for the marriage of the lamb has come , and his wife has made herself ready . "

and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to the war ; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the throne , and they opened books . another book was opened , which is the book of life . the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books , according to their works .
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things .
he who acts unjustly , let him act unjustly still . he who is filthy , let him be filthy still . he who is righteous , let him do righteousness still . he who is holy , let him be holy still . "
