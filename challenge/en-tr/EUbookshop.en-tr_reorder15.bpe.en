the 2007 ES@@ PA@@ D report sub@@ stance use among students in 35 countries
country samp@@ le siz@@ es were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
in all ES@@ PA@@ D countries at least two thirds of the students have dr@@ un@@ k alcohol at least once during their lif@@ etime , with an ES@@ PA@@ D average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) , the Is@@ le of Man and the United Kingdom .
lif@@ etime use of mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms was reported by 3 % while G@@ H@@ B and ster@@ o@@ ids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de as reported experience of in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug use .
in the two top @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Is@@ le of Man ) one in six students reported can@@ na@@ bis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular can@@ na@@ bis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 % in Armenia , the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries are most often found in western Europe .
countries where many students report past 30 days can@@ na@@ bis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try can@@ na@@ bis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illi@@ cit drugs at least once during their lif@@ etime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @@@ -@@ @ year can@@ na@@ bis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related problems , and the average pre@@ val@@ ence of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from can@@ na@@ bis were found , and the percentage of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users in a population correspon@@ ds to the can@@ na@@ bis use pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the single countries .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall up@@ ward trend when the period is considered all in all .
since there is a high co @@@ -@@ @ vari@@ ation between illi@@ cit drug use and can@@ na@@ bis use on the country level , quite n@@ atur@@ ally the development for lif@@ etime can@@ na@@ bis use is more or less the same as described for all illi@@ cit drugs above .
the overall sub@@ stance @@@ -@@ @ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the vari@@ able in focus .
a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illi@@ cit drug use is rising .
nearly 25 % of op@@ i@@ oid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more , with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20 .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe gives a precise defin@@ ition of serious offences and covers the laundering of the proceeds of such offences , including financing of terrorist activities .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
difficulties in defining the quanti@@ ty of a single d@@ ose and evidence that the exception has been mis@@ used in court to benefit drug deal@@ ers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annul@@ ment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint direc@@ tive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecut@@ ors @@@ -@@ @ General dealt with can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offen@@ ders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guide@@ line on can@@ na@@ bis , " according to which possession of up to 10 gram@@ s of can@@ na@@ bis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
the af@@ ore@@ mentioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sent@@ encing of over 1 800 cases in six different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ( Sch@@ ä@@ fer and Pa@@ ol@@ i , 2006 ) .
in Romania , court sent@@ encing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social re@@ integration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the san@@ ction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed comp@@ ul@@ sory treatment , effectively decreas@@ ing the involvement of the prob@@ ation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical gu@@ idance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . in France and Ireland ) .
in this regard , it is hel@@ p@@ ful that the concept of selec@@ tive prevention does not focus on drug use and does not sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ se drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulner@@ ability in a broader sense .
several M@@ ember States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .

in the new central European M@@ ember States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @@@ -@@ @ in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent inf@@ ec@@ tious disease .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing inf@@ ec@@ tious disease are clearly ge@@ ar@@ ed towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for deliver@@ ing medical and social services .
an initiative in this direction is the joint E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA @@@ -@@ @ cor@@ relation project , supported by experts from the national fo@@ cal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
the service most com@@ mon@@ ly offered to home@@ less problem drug users is access to " gener@@ ic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries comb@@ ine the two systems .
participation in ES@@ PA@@ D has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU M@@ ember States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
the survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illi@@ cit drugs , with the standard time fra@@ mes , and frequ@@ ency of use .

at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 4@@ a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily can@@ na@@ bis users .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents seeking treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use who have co@@ existing mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influ@@ encing demand for treatment ( 78

Netherlands ( 16@@ 7 ) . the average p@@ urity of heroin products has been f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ating in most reporting countries ( 16@@ 8 ) since 1999 , making it difficult to identify any overall trend .
for example , in countries with a high pro@@ portion of sti@@ mul@@ ant users ( the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) , the rates of in@@ j@@ ecting among heroin users might not be representative of the overall situation .
in some EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember States from which data are available ( Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom ) , rates of in@@ j@@ ecting among heroin users in treatment have declined .

in the Nordic region , the great majority of noti@@ fied ac@@ ute cases of hep@@ ati@@ tis B occur among I@@ D@@ U@@ s , and hep@@ ati@@ tis B out@@ breaks have coinci@@ ded with increases in drug in@@ j@@ ecting in several countries .
in Finland , hep@@ ati@@ tis B noti@@ fic@@ ations among I@@ D@@ U@@ s have fallen ste@@ ep@@ ly in recent years , possibly as a result of vacc@@ ination programmes and a comprehensive ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge exchange system .
the purchase of sy@@ r@@ inges through pharmac@@ ies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , and the potential to explo@@ it this contact point as a con@@ du@@ it to other services clearly exists .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA figures include a few deaths among those over 65 years , with only seven countries reporting that more than 5 % of cases fall into this age group ( 20@@ 3 ) .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreas@@ es in the numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment avail@@ ability and harm reduction initiatives , although dec@@ lines in the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use may also be important .
although interpre@@ tations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths in some countries , these pat@@ ter@@ ns could be related to the trends in heroin in@@ j@@ ection ( 20@@ 9 ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe meth@@ ad@@ one sub@@ stitution treatment is not currently considered a major response to reduce over@@ d@@ ose deaths .
however , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
these kinds of indirect statistical methods comple@@ ment population survey work , which , for a range of meth@@ od@@ ological and practical reasons , is less su@@ itable for esti@@ m@@ ating the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use that is of low pre@@ val@@ ence , sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ sed and largely hidden .
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison sett@@ ings .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
increased pre@@ val@@ ence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest pre@@ val@@ ence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @@@ -@@ @ 6 % in 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds ) .
reductions in cultiv@@ ation can be achieved quickly but are rever@@ sed equally quickly .
there is also some activity in the area of developing inde@@ x@@ es designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
however , a study commissioned by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has shown that it is possible to assess Co@@ ordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Co@@ ordination out@@ comes ( Ken@@ is , 2006 ) .
the concep@@ tu@@ alisation of both instruments has involved interesting meth@@ od@@ ological developments and has allowed a first in@@ sight into the use of overall inde@@ x@@ es to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .

at the end of 2006 , the European Commission presented its first progress review ( 5 ) on the implementation of the EU drugs action plan ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 ) .
this assessed the extent to which the activities planned for 2006 were achieved and whether the plan 's objectives for 2006 have been fulfilled .
this is stated to be in the interest of good order , safety , health and security , and would be carried out on samples of ur@@ ine , oral f@@ lu@@ ids and / or ha@@ ir .

EU funding for drug @@@ -@@ @ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .
approximately half ( 53 % ) of the out@@ patient clients are treated for primary op@@ i@@ oid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular can@@ na@@ bis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .

annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using can@@ na@@ bis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in can@@ na@@ bis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the range 10 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % ( 32
levels of can@@ na@@ bis use in France , Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom pre@@ val@@ ence levels in recent years ( 2002 , 2003 and 2005 respectively ) , following a period of steady increases .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s on@@ wards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable in@@ sight into trends over time .
there are differences between countries in the frequ@@ ency of can@@ na@@ bis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily can@@ na@@ bis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
concerns have been raised that it may be in@@ appropriate to treat young can@@ na@@ bis users in general drug services if this leads to clients
in recent school surveys , increases in lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of ec@@ st@@ asy use occurred largely in parallel among both male and female school students , although there is a pro@@ gressive increase in the gender gap with increasing age .
although small in number , cr@@ ack cocaine users are likely to be at particularly high risk of experiencing problems and may be difficult to engage in treatment and other services .
detec@@ ting trends in both price and p@@ urity is hampered by a lack of consistent data , and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries ( 1@@ 18 ) .
generally , the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance .
for EU countries where estimates of problem op@@ i@@ oid use were available for 2005 , the extent of sub@@ stitution treatment among problem op@@ i@@ oid users was calculated ( F@@ ig@@ ure 10 ) .
figure 10 : number of op@@ i@@ oid maintenance treatment clients as a percentage of the estimated number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users , 2005 generally high , education levels low , and between 10 % and 18 % are reported to be home@@ less .
most clients ( 60 % ) report initi@@ ation of op@@ i@@ oid use before the age of 20 ; first use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids after the age of 25 was very un@@ common ( 13@@ 3 ) .
there are , though , no fatal cases that can be directly attributed to B@@ Z@@ P . in March 2007 , the EU responded to rising concern over the use of B@@ Z@@ P by
m@@ C@@ P@@ P their legislation addressing psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic substan@@ ces .
in Am@@ sterdam , the reported number of non @@@ -@@ @ fatal emer@@ gen@@ cies due to the use of G@@ H@@ B was 76 in 2005 , exceeding , as in previous years , the medical emer@@ gen@@ cies attributed to use of
" drug @@@ -@@ @ indu@@ ced deaths " and " ac@@ ute drug deaths " ( 15@@ 5 ) .
in Europe , most op@@ i@@ oid deaths are related to heroin , but often other substan@@ ces are also identified as having possibly played a role , in particular alcohol , benz@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines , or other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids and , in some countries , cocaine .
the Czech Republic , Denmark , Germany , Latvia , Malta , the Netherlands , Austria , Portugal and the United Kingdom .

a collabor@@ ative study that started within an E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA project found that op@@ i@@ oid users recru@@ ited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their pe@@ ers of the same age ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) .
suggested to account for this recent increase , among which are pol@@ y@@ drug use by op@@ i@@ oid users , or a possible increase in the avail@@ ability of heroin .
a long@@ itu@@ din@@ al study on the effectiveness of treat@@ ments for heroin addi@@ ction , which will examine the association between re@@ tention in treatment and mortality , is currently under@@ way in Italy ( Bar@@ g@@ ag@@ li et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from op@@ i@@ oid drugs are at an ele@@ v@@ ated risk of an over@@ d@@ ose , if they rela@@ p@@ se back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .

this makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflec@@ tions on how drug policies have performed to date , and what direc@@ tions should be pursu@@ ed in the future .
this distinc@@ tion has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .

Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fif@@ ty times higher than that found among the general population .
relatively high levels of initi@@ ation also appear to be still oc@@ curr@@ ing in some M@@ ember States , as indicated by studies among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users that show a relatively high pro@@ portion of young and new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
in 2008 , 13 EU M@@ ember States have already red@@ raf@@ ted or are due to review and red@@ ra@@ ft their national dru@@ g@@ policy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policy@@ making at national level .
in the period 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @@@ -@@ @ enacted it after 12 years without , and the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal defin@@ itions of personal use were wi@@ dened from a maximum of one d@@ ose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 dos@@ es .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established
though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
detailed information on research in the drugs field carried out in European countries has been collected by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA through its network of Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points .
in addition to public@@ ations speci@@ alising in illi@@ cit drugs and addi@@ ction , articles on illi@@ cit drug use are also published in pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ reviewed journ@@ als from a wide array of discipl@@ ines and in professional magaz@@ ines .
for instance , providing information about drug effects alone , a widespread approach in Europe , is not only in@@ effective but may carry risks of un@@ wanted effects ( W@@ er@@ ch and O@@ w@@ en , 2002 ) .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe sub@@ stitution treatment and ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge exchange programmes ( N@@ SP@@ s ) , which target over@@ d@@ ose deaths and the spread of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases .
in Hungary , where N@@ SP@@ s and out@@ reach work have been increasing , a study among the out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
after meth@@ ad@@ one , bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is the second most com@@ mon@@ ly pres@@ cri@@ bed op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitute , and its use in the treatment of op@@ i@@ oid dependence has increased in recent years ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .
Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of in@@ mates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of in@@ mates have in@@ j@@ ected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wal@@ es in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .

annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe been reported by Latvia and Denmark , while in Sweden and Finland the percentage of new amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine clients declined , possibly suggesting an ag@@ eing population ( 67 ) .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Gri@@ ff@@ i@@ ths et al . , 2008 ) .
countries with sufficient data on last year pre@@ val@@ ence of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use among the 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .

Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 87 ) .
similarly , in Italy , in 2006 , there were estimated to be between 3.@@ 7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
elsewhere in Europe , cocaine accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of all treatment demands ( 10 countries ) or less than 5 % ( 12 countries ) ( 93 ) .
overall the estimated lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the U@@ SA .
in 2006 , around 8 000 cr@@ ack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 1@@ 02 ) .
in Italy , a lar@@ ges@@ cal@@ e clin@@ ical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als ( ar@@ ip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and ro@@ pin@@ ir@@ ole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
for example , the incentive could be v@@ ou@@ chers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abst@@ in@@ ence . in this scenario , failure to stay dru@@ g@@ free results in the loss of the acc@@ um@@ ulated gains .

most drug clients entering out@@ patient treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 23 % ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 18 % ) .
B@@ up@@ ren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
in Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids other than heroin or meth@@ ad@@ one : mainly bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , pain@@ kil@@ lers and other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 112 ) .

the var@@ ying levels of new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initi@@ ation as well as increasing in@@ j@@ ecting inci@@ dence among the younger or the older populations .
O@@ pi@@ oid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational at@@ tain@@ ment than other clients ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequ@@ ency of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders is noted .
additionally , a r@@ and@@ om@@ ised trial of in@@ j@@ ec@@ table op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( R@@ I@@ O@@ T@@ T ) is currently under@@ way in the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom which will assess the effectiveness of in@@ j@@ ec@@ table di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , in@@ j@@ ec@@ table meth@@ ad@@ one and oral meth@@ ad@@ one .
treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
re@@ views of r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials and ob@@ serv@@ ational studies conclude that meth@@ ad@@ one maintenance treatment ( M@@ M@@ T ) and bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine maintenance treatment ( BM@@ T ) can both be effective for the management of op@@ i@@ oid dependence .
in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnos@@ ed inf@@ ections related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use with trends in HIV pre@@ val@@ ence among I@@ D@@ U@@ s suggests that the inci@@ dence of HIV infection related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .
moreover , many dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths are , in fact , pol@@ y@@ drug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
however , other approaches are being explo@@ red where@@ by data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attri@@ but@@ able to drugs in a community ( see " Over@@ all dru@@ g@@ related mortality , " P . 86 ) .
a recent Norwegian study of a co@@ h@@ ort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 18@@ 9 recorded deaths , over@@ dos@@ es , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
however , in 2007 , the United Kingdom 's Department of Health issued new guidelines on clin@@ ical management of drug misuse and dependence , setting out specific actions for the prevention of dru@@ g@@ related deaths .
to identify current developments in the online drug market , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA conducted a sn@@ ap@@ shot study in early 2008 , which surveyed 25 online shops .
the U@@ SA , for example , sof@@ tened its approach to the provision of ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @@@ -@@ @ term data .
a c@@ av@@ eat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the ep@@ i@@ demic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems ar@@ ising from the use of this drug are considerable .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional perspective is becoming increasingly un@@ hel@@ p@@ ful in understanding the developing nature of pat@@ ter@@ ns of sub@@ stance use in Europe .
in Europe today , pol@@ y@@ drug pat@@ ter@@ ns are the nor@@ m , and the combined use of different substan@@ ces is responsible for , or complic@@ ates , most of the problems we face .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly dev@@ alu@@ ed if they simply open the door for the use of a sub@@ stitute , which may be even more damaging .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreas@@ es , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and pro@@ portion of treatment demands related to op@@ i@@ oid drugs .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be di@@ ff@@ using into new populations .
the illi@@ cit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes , new products and marketing opportunities , as well as demonstrating the ability to adap@@ t quickly to control measures .
changes in the ec@@ st@@ asy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the di@@ version of prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als , and these efforts may also have important
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @@@ -@@ @ based products , in particular her@@ bal mi@@ x@@ tures , as well as mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise containing syn@@ thetic compo@@ unds .
new substan@@ ces appe@@ aring on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world , to experim@@ ental chem@@ ic@@ als syn@@ th@@ es@@ ised in laborat@@ ories and un@@ tested in hum@@ ans .
the enforcement of drug prohibi@@ tion is jud@@ ged by the study to have caused substantial un@@ intended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . geographical dis@@ placement of production and trafficking ) .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial co@@ operation between M@@ ember States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .

evalu@@ ator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of ref@@ le@@ ction in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
national drug strategies and action plans
a key priority of the plan is to dis@@ su@@ ade young people from beginning to use drugs by re@@ affir@@ ming the prohibi@@ tion of drug use and in@@ forming young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of non@@ governmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the prepar@@ atory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
most countries could provide data on central government expendi@@ ture , and seven also reported expendi@@ ture by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
esti@@ m@@ ating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illi@@ cit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .
in contrast , for those countries providing C@@ O@@ FO@@ G data for un@@ la@@ bel@@ led
in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exemp@@ ts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of sy@@ r@@ inges dis@@ pen@@ sed .

the rati@@ o is lower among primary users of non @@@ -@@ @ cocaine sti@@ mul@@ ants ( 2.2 : 1 ) and higher among users of cocaine ( 5.@@ 1 : 1 ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 8 : 1 ) .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment mod@@ ality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
the new mo@@ dul@@ e also includes : links to other information sources , evalu@@ ated interven@@ tions , a g@@ los@@ s@@ ary and a brief syn@@ op@@ sis of the g@@ aps in the current evidence base .
most countries provide a range of health care and social services , including individual risk assessment and advice , safer use training , inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases testing and coun@@ selling , vacc@@ ination and treatment of vir@@ al hep@@ ati@@ tis .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including compu@@ ter@@ ised datab@@ ases and dedicated communication networks .
performing checks and sear@@ ches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more gener@@ ic tac@@ tic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .

cr@@ ack cocaine use in Europe
the first group typically reports s@@ nor@@ ting the drug , and sometimes consum@@ ing it in con@@ jun@@ ction with other substan@@ ces such as alcohol or can@@ na@@ bis , but not with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
for example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where op@@ i@@ oid users are the main cli@@ en@@ te@@ le . measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
according to a recent Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e review , this combination has yi@@ elded the best results for the treatment of sti@@ mul@@ ant dependence ( K@@ n@@ ap@@ p et al . , 2007 ) .
in addition , 11 M@@ ember States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or cr@@ ack cocaine users .
in@@ j@@ ecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . HIV / AIDS , hep@@ ati@@ tis ) or dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths .
in Cyprus , an estimate made in 2007 indicates that there has been a significant increase in problem op@@ i@@ oid use , which has been linked with an increase in foreign nationals in treatment ( 1@@ 14 ) . information from the
treatment reports also suggest that among op@@ i@@ oid users , the popularity of in@@ j@@ ecting may v@@ ary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among new op@@ i@@ oid clients ran@@ ges from 0.@@ 9 % to 47.@@ 2 % .
the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . this trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Czech Republic , Germany ) .

at the same time , care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substan@@ ces is not com@@ promised ( Ch@@ ern@@ y et al . , 2006 ) .
female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .
high levels of psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a con@@ com@@ it@@ ant psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty were primary op@@ i@@ oid users ( 125 ) .

to reduce the burden of hep@@ ati@@ tis C in Europe , it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group - chron@@ ic carriers of the virus who are active drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .

this ten fold increase has several key drivers , not least the movement of raw materials and goods - which come from our environment .
it was here that the global effort to tackle climate change began in ear@@ n@@ est . the summit resulted in the United N@@ ations Framework Convention on C@@ lim@@ ate Change ( UNF@@ C@@ C@@ C ) which forms the legal basis for global efforts to address climate change .
this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Co@@ p 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es .
the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ col , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNF@@ C@@ C@@ C , is a first step in the long @@@ -@@ @ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the K@@ yo@@ to ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
governments at local and national level , desper@@ ate to boost water supply , are investing in projects such as reser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s for st@@ oring water , water transfer and de@@ sal@@ ination plants , which make salt water fit for drinking .

the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from rene@@ w@@ ables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , et@@ c@@ . as well as bio@@ energy ) by 2020 .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' haz@@ ard@@ ous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .
the data do not facilitate an analysis of whether the shi@@ pped waste receives better treatment at its destination , so we don '@@ t know whether it is bad for the environment .
