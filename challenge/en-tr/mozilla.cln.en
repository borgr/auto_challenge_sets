Extensions and Themes
Extensions and themes are like apps for your browser, and they let you protect passwords, download videos, find deals, block annoying ads, change how your browser looks, and much more. These small software programs are often developed by a third party. Here’s a selection { -brand-product-name } <a data-l10n-name="learn-more-trigger">recommends</a> for exceptional security, performance, and functionality.
Extensions are not allowed to run by default in Private Windows. They won’t work while private browsing, and they won’t have access to your online activities. You can allow each extension to run in Private Windows by managing your settings.
Extensions are not allowed to run by default in Private Windows. This means they won’t work while private browsing, and they won’t have access to your online activities there.

<span class='hostname'></span> has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which means that &brandShortName; can only connect to it securely. You can’t add an exception to visit this site.
<span class='hostname'></span> is most likely a safe site, but a secure connection could not be established. This issue is caused by <span class='mitm-name'/>, which is either software on your computer or your network.
An attacker could easily reveal information which you thought to be safe. <span class='hostname'></span> uses security technology that is outdated and vulnerable to attack.

%S uses an invalid security certificate.
So, if an antivirus program or a network is intercepting a connection with a security certificate issued by a CA that is not in the Mozilla CA store, the connection is considered unsafe. %S uses the Mozilla CA store to verify that a connection is secure, rather than certificates supplied by the user’s operating system.

Websites
Websites can secretly attach a “supercookie” to your browser that can follow you around the web, even after you clear your cookies. { -brand-short-name } now provides strong protection against supercookies so they can’t be used to track your online activities from one site to the next.

Sync isn't designed as a permanent backup – it's just sharing what is saved locally. If you reset your password and your data isn't stored on at least one other device, you could lose all the information associated with the old password. That's why you'll want to install Firefox and use Sync on more than one device.

Add-ons are applications that let you personalize &brandShortName; with extra functionality or style. Try a time-saving sidebar, a weather notifier, or a themed look to make &brandShortName; your own.
Add-ons are small apps you can add to %S that do lots of things — from managing to-do lists, to downloading videos, to changing the look of your browser.

Compare prices, check the weather or express your personality with a custom theme. Add-ons let you add features to %S, so your browser works harder for you.

A form was submitted in the %S encoding which cannot encode all Unicode characters, so user input may get corrupted. To avoid this problem, the page should be changed so that the form is submitted in the UTF-8 encoding either by changing the encoding of the page itself to UTF-8 or by specifying accept-charset=utf-8 on the form element.

Surprises can be appropriate in many situations, but they are not welcome when user security, privacy, and control are at stake. It is extremely important to be as transparent as possible when submitting an add-on for hosting on this site. A Mozilla user should be able to easily discern what the functionality of an add-on is and not be presented with unexpected experiences post-install.

Firefox Health Report (FHR) records anonymous data about your computer, configuration, usage, performance, and error conditions. This data helps us improve Firefox for you and for other Firefox users.
Firefox Health Report lets you know how your Firefox is performing and what you can do to improve it.
Firefox Health Report lets you optimize your Firefox and helps us build a more excellent browser. Reports will be pretty basic at first, but will continue to evolve and grow.
Firefox Health Report records information about your browser and device. You can <a href="#raw" class="navigate">see the information we record.</a> You can also see what you share with Mozilla.
Firefox is distributed through channels: Nightly builds, the Aurora pre-release channel, a stable Beta, and the public release. This field identifies the channel.
For each browsing session, Firefox Health Report records approximately how long you browsed (in seconds), and whether the session ended normally or because of a crash. Also includes startup times (in milliseconds) if available.
For more information about how we handle your data, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/legal/privacy/firefox.html#health-report" target="_blank" class="external"><span aria-hidden="true" class="external_icon"></span>see our privacy policy.</a>

A strong password uses a combination of upper and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. It doesn’t contain personal info like your address, birthday, or family names.
A strong PIN does not contain personal info, such as your date of birth or address. It should be a number only you know and can’t be easily guessed.

Data Aggregator Breach
Data Aggregator Breaches
Data aggregators, or data brokers, collect information from public records and buy it from other companies. They compile this data to sell it to companies for marketing purposes. Victims of these breaches are less likely to experience financial fraud, but hackers could use this data to impersonate or profile them.
Data breaches are on the rise. If your personal info appears in a new data breach, { -product-name } sends you an alert — so you can take action and protect your accounts.
Data breaches can affect anyone. Spread the word so your friends and family can check to see if their online accounts are safe.

You’re taking important steps towards protecting your online accounts.
Your information was discovered in a new data breach.
Your information was part of a data breach.
Your Internet Protocol address (IP address) can reveal your location and internet service provider. A service like { -brand-fpn } hides your IP address and location for { -brand-name } and a service like { -brand-mozilla-vpn } hides your IP address and location for your entire device.
Your Internet Protocol address (IP address) pinpoints your location and internet service provider. A service like { -brand-fpn } masks your IP address to hide your location.
Your Internet Protocol address (IP address) pinpoints your location and internet service provider. With a virtual private network (VPN), you can hide your location and mask your IP address.
Your passwords protect more than your accounts. They protect every bit of personal information that resides in them. And hackers rely on bad habits, like using the same password everywhere or using common phrases (p@ssw0rd, anyone?) so that if they hack one account, they can hack many. Here’s how to better protect your accounts.

Firefox is maintained by the Mozilla Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation. While Firefox does produce revenue -- chiefly through search partnerships -- this earned income is largely reinvested back into the Corporation. The Mozilla Foundation's education and advocacy efforts, which span several continents and reach millions of people, are supported by philanthropic donations.
For donors outside of the United States, please consult with your tax adviser about whether your donation is tax deductible.

The Mozilla Foundation is a California non-profit corporation exempt from United States federal income taxation under IRC 501(c)(3) and a public charity classified under IRC sections 170(b)(1)(A) and 509(a)(1). Bitcoin donations Mozilla receives are considered charitable contributions under U.S. federal tax laws, to be used in its discretion for its charitable purposes. Because the IRS has indicated that it will treat bitcoin as property for U.S. tax purposes (see IRS Notice 2014-21), donations of bitcoin may be subject to special rules as to the amount of your charitable deduction, the documentation that must be provided to claim a tax deduction, or other matters.

We want to protect the privacy and data that belongs to our donors, which means we limit how much "tracking" information and data we send across systems. This protects your sensitive data, but also means we can’t customize the Firefox start page once you have donated.
We work hard to protect your information. We believe in, and practice, multi-layered security controls and practices, including both technical and organizational methods. We have agreements with third parties and have adopted other security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of the information under our control or under the control of our service providers. The vendors receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla. The vendors we use to send emails or other marketing materials to you aren’t permitted to use your information for their own direct marketing purposes. They also aren’t allowed to share your data with anyone else for direct marketing purposes. In addition, we will keep your personal data only for as long as we need it to provide you services, manage our business or as required by law or contract. You can find more information in the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> section titled <em>“What else should you know?”</em>
What are the ways I can donate?
When I make a donation, how long do you retain my data?
When you donate to Mozilla via a third party like <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">PayPal</a> or <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy/">Stripe</a>, those organizations also collect user data.
When you donate to the Mozilla Foundation, we receive personal information from you. We use this data to acknowledge your donation, provide you with donation receipts, and correspond with you through newsletters or email. You can read more about what information we receive, the purposes we use that information for, and how we handle it in our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.

The Mozilla Foundation is a California non-profit corporation exempt from United States federal income taxation under IRC 501(c)(3) and a public charity classified under IRC sections 170(b)(1)(A) and 509(a)(1). Bitcoin donations Mozilla receives are considered charitable contributions under U.S. federal tax laws, to be used in its discretion for its charitable purposes. Because the IRS has indicated that it will treat bitcoin as property for U.S. tax purposes (see IRS Notice 2014-21), donations of bitcoin may be subject to special rules as to the amount of your charitable deduction, the documentation that must be provided to claim a tax deduction, or other matters.

A browser built for speed.
A browser is still a tool, so it makes sense that you’ll want to pick the best one for the job. If you’re a human who needs to work to survive, you’ll need a fast internet browser. One thing to keep in mind is a browser that runs third-party trackers is more likely to be slower than a browser that doesn’t. Third-party trackers are cookies, and while you can’t see them, they are running in the background of the site, taking up precious time. The more third-party trackers a browser blocks, the faster it can run.

Every computer program you run takes up some memory. When too much is used, your system can slooooowww down. Firefox aims for a balance — using enough memory to let you browse smoothly and leaving plenty of memory to keep your computer responsive.
Everyone deserves access to the internet — your language should never be a barrier. That’s why — with the help of dedicated volunteers around the world — we make the Firefox Browser available in more than 90 languages.

Here’s how Firefox protects your privacy
Here’s the key thing to know: 64-bit applications can access more memory and are less likely to crash than 32-bit applications. Also, with the jump from 32 to 64 bits, a security feature called <a href=%(ASLR)s>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)</a> works better to protect you from attackers. Linux and macOS users, fret not, you already enjoy a Firefox that’s optimized for 64-bit.

If you see “(32-bit)” and you are running Firefox 56.0 or older, updating to the latest Firefox version should automatically upgrade you to 64-bit.

Is your computer slow? Your browser might be using too much memory. Switch to Firefox today for more speed.
It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.
It looks like you’re running an older version of Firefox.
It’s a <strong>family of products</strong> that treat your personal data with respect.
It’s a whole family of products designed to keep you safer and smarter online.
It seems like every company on the web is buying and selling my data. You’re probably no different.
It’s everything you need to know about <strong>staying safe online</strong>.
It’s not a big deal until it’s not there. With Firefox Sync, your browsing history is always right where you expect it to be.

It’s probably just a server error and we’re working to fix it.
It’s <strong>a community</strong> that believes tech can do better.
It’s <strong>privacy and peace of mind</strong> on mobile, too.
It’s your Web anywhere you go.
I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
I’ve been collaborating with the Mozilla community since 2004, helping with website localization, QA, user support and community marketing. I’ve also helped organize events in Spain and performed IT tasks within the Mozilla Hispano community.
I went to my first local Mozilla event in 2011 and was inspired to do more by all the amazing people I met and got to know. And now, I am the Mozilla Philippines Community Manager.

Mozilla does collect a limited set of data by default from Firefox that helps us to understand how people use the browser. That data is tied to a random identifier, rather than your name or email address. You can read more about that on our <a href="%(privacy)s">privacy notice</a> and you can read the <a href="%(data)s">full documentation for that data collection</a>.
Mozilla doesn’t just value your email privacy and security – it’s part of our <a href="%(manifesto)s">Manifesto</a>: “Individuals’ security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.” <a href="%(principles)s">You can learn about our Data Privacy Principles here</a>.

Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.
Mozilla doesn’t sell data about you, and we don’t buy data about you.

Multi-tasking with multiple tabs just got easier. Firefox is now a multi-process browser, which means that your tabs stay fresh and won’t take forever to reload. With 86% less hang time, switch quickly between tabs even as you open more.
My favorite part of being a Mozillian is the global community. I like to think of us as a “family” where we accept each other openly and are free to speak our minds while we work together.
My goal now is to keep growing our global community through localization (translation), hacking and Webmaker projects. If you’re interested, please get in touch.
My passion is for organizing local Webmaker and WoMoz (Women in Mozilla) community events where I can train others and help them develop their skills. I also help out with the Firefox Student Ambassadors program and Community Building.

Over the last decade we have seen this promise fulfilled in many ways. We have also seen the power of the internet used to magnify divisiveness, incite violence, promote hatred, and intentionally manipulate fact and reality. We have learned that we should more explicitly set out our aspirations for the human experience of the internet. We do so now.

The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.

The principles we wrote in 1998 still guide us today. And in 2018, we created an addendum to emphasize inclusion, privacy and safety for everyone online.

There are a few ways a browser can help its users stay secure. A browser that is up to date with the latest security tech can help protect your computer and websites from unwanted visitors, such as malware or computer viruses.
There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
There are two categories of data that we collect by default in our release version of Firefox.

These are the principles that guide our mission to promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the web.

The second is what we call "interaction data." This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.
These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone.

Welcome to the all-new Firefox Quantum: Developer Edition
Welcome to your new favorite browser. Get the latest features, fast performance, and the development tools you need to build for the open web.
We led the tech to run 3D games at near-native speeds, and now Firefox is bringing better performance to online gaming. Our powerful browser reduces lags, speeds up ping times and optimizes overall gameplay through faster, leaner browsing.
Well, it seems like you really have my back on this privacy stuff.
We look forward to soon begin sharing tips &amp; tricks on getting the most out of Firefox, as well as exciting news about Mozilla and how we’re working to create a better Web.
We love sharing updates about all the awesome things happening at Mozilla.
We made Enhanced Tracking Protection because no one should be able to follow you online without your permission. And now you can see just how many data-collecting trackers Firefox has blocked for you — along with other ways our products protect your privacy.
We make our documentation public so that anyone can verify what we say is true, tell us if we need to improve, and have confidence that we aren’t hiding anything.
We make the internet safer, healthier and faster for good.

We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="%(link)s">studies</a>. For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites.

We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
We’re all about a healthy internet but sometimes broken URLs happen.
We’re always transparent.
We’re backed by <a href="%(mozilla)s">Mozilla</a>, the not-for-profit organization that puts people over profit to give everyone more power online. We created this extension because we believe that you should have easy-to-use tools that help you manage your privacy and security.

When you use a browser for everything, it needs to be fast. But for the same reason, it needs to be private. A browser has access to everything you do online, so it can put you at real risk if it doesn’t have strong privacy features.
When you use Firefox, you help Mozilla fight misinformation online, teach digital skills and make the comments section more human. Check out what helps create a healthier internet.
When you use the new Firefox, you get a blazing fast experience while supporting Mozilla’s mission to keep the internet healthy, weird and welcoming to all.
Where would you like to get started?
Whether you’re using Firefox on your phone or computer, make sure all your important stuff — internet searches, passwords, open tabs — appears where you need it.
Whether you’ve opened 10 or 1000, switching between tabs is faster than ever with Firefox’s new, responsive engine.

About us
A browser built for speed.
A browser is still a tool, so it makes sense that you’ll want to pick the best one for the job. If you’re a human who needs to work to survive, you’ll need a fast internet browser. One thing to keep in mind is a browser that runs third-party trackers is more likely to be slower than a browser that doesn’t. Third-party trackers are cookies, and while you can’t see them, they are running in the background of the site, taking up precious time. The more third-party trackers a browser blocks, the faster it can run.

{ -brand-name-mozilla } does collect a limited set of data by default from { -brand-name-firefox } that helps us to understand how people use the browser.

Privacy Notices and Policy
Privacy on the web is a hot button issue. If privacy is number one on your list of priorities, you want to look for a browser that takes that seriously. When choosing the best private browser for you, look at the tracking policy and how a browser handles your data. These seem like technical questions, but they’re the reason some browsers are more private than others.

The { -brand-name-mozilla } project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the { -brand-name-mozilla } { -brand-name-firefox } web browser.

The internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.

The principles we wrote in 1998 still guide us today. And in 2018, we created an addendum to emphasize inclusion, privacy and safety for everyone online.
The speed you need. The privacy you deserve.
There are a few ways a browser can help its users stay secure. A browser that is up to date with the latest security tech can help protect your computer and websites from unwanted visitors, such as malware or computer viruses.
There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the { -brand-name-mozilla } Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that { -brand-name-mozilla } participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the { -brand-name-mozilla } project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use { -brand-name-mozilla } { -brand-name-firefox } and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
There are two categories of data that we collect by default in our release version of { -brand-name-firefox }.

Visual bookmarks for your favorite places on the web
Add-on user change history
These are the principles that guide our mission to promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the web.
For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed. The second is what we call “interaction data.” This is data about an individual’s engagement with { -brand-name-firefox }, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers.
These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The { -brand-name-mozilla-foundation } is committed to advancing the principles set out in the { -brand-name-mozilla } Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the internet an ever better place for everyone.

We keep your data safe, never sold.
Welcome to { -brand-name-firefox }
We have received your report. Thanks for letting us know about your concerns with this add-on.
Welcome to { -brand-name-firefox-browser } { -brand-name-developer-edition }
Welcome to the all-new { -brand-name-firefox-quantum }: { -brand-name-developer-edition }
Welcome to your new favorite browser. Get the latest features, fast performance, and the development tools you need to build for the open web.
Our powerful browser reduces lags, speeds up ping times and optimizes overall gameplay through faster, leaner browsing. We led the tech to run 3D games at near-native speeds, and now { -brand-name-firefox } is bringing better performance to online gaming.
Well, it seems like you really have my back on this privacy stuff.
We make a point of knowing less about you
We make our documentation public so that anyone can verify what we say is true, tell us if we need to improve, and have confidence that we aren’t hiding anything.
We make the internet safer, healthier and faster for good.
For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="{ $link }">studies</a>. This helps us answer specific questions to improve { -brand-name-firefox }, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.
We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
We have received your report. Thanks for letting us know about your concerns with this user.
We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
We’re all about a healthy internet but sometimes broken URLs happen.
We created this extension because we believe that you should have easy-to-use tools that help you manage your privacy and security. We’re backed by <a href="{ $mozilla }">{ -brand-name-mozilla }</a>, the not-for-profit organization that puts people over profit to give everyone more power online.
We’re building a better Internet
We're building the technology of the future. Come explore with us.
We’re obsessed with protecting your privacy. That’s why we’ve made { -brand-name-firefox } Private Browsing more powerful than the others.

Were you one of 100,985,047 invited to the <a href="{ $evite_breach }">Evite data breach “party”</a>?
We Stand for People Over Profit.
What does this mean?
We store your encrypted data on our servers so we can’t read it.
We support communities all over the world standing up for a healthier internet. Add your voice to the fight.
We’ve been working out, so you can get more done.
We visit hundreds or even thousands of websites each day, and you can’t expect users to make security and privacy decisions for each of these sites. That is why a browser that gives you more control is so important - because it offers real, meaningful protection.
We will only send you { -brand-name-firefox }-related information.

What you see is what you get
When the { -brand-name-facebook } breach was revealed, { -brand-name-mozilla } had an immediate response – and a { -brand-name-firefox } product to support user privacy.
Now take the next step to protect yourself. When you choose { -brand-name-firefox }, you support a better web for you and everyone else.
When you contribute to { -brand-name-mozilla }, you become part of a worldwide community made up of people from around the globe who believe that we all have a role in ensuring that the internet remains a force for good.
When you enter your email address in { -brand-name-firefox-monitor }, we forget it immediately after we’ve checked for a match in known data breaches — unless you authorize us to continue monitoring new breaches for your personal information.
When you go to a website and the page remembers your username and password – that’s made possible by a cookie.
When you use a browser for everything, it needs to be fast. But for the same reason, it needs to be private. A browser has access to everything you do online, so it can put you at real risk if it doesn’t have strong privacy features.
Check out what helps create a healthier internet. When you use { -brand-name-firefox }, you help { -brand-name-mozilla } fight misinformation online, teach digital skills and make the comments section more human.
When you use the new { -brand-name-firefox }, you get a blazing fast experience while supporting { -brand-name-mozilla }’s mission to keep the internet healthy, weird and welcoming to all.
When Mozilla becomes aware of add-ons, plugins, or other third-party software that seriously compromises Firefox security, stability, or performance and meets %(criteriaStartLink)scertain criteria%(criteriaEndLink)s, the software may be blocked from general use. For more information, please read %(supportStartLink)sthis support article%(supportEndLink)s.

Tab Center is an attempt to solve some of the issues that have emerged from the way people use tabs (most notably the “too many tabs” problem) and provide a more versatile UI basis for future innovation. The first version of this Firefox add-on arranges tabs in a vertical rather than horizontal fashion. It is heavily inspired by and borrows ideas from the excellent VerticalTabs add-on.

Containers
Containers Graduation Report
Containers let you create profiles in Firefox for all of your online lives. Custom labels and color-coded tabs help keep different activities — like online shopping, travel planning, or checking work email — separate. Because Containers store cookies separately, you can log into the same site with a different account in each Container, and online trackers can’t connect your browsing in one container to another. So you can keep your shopping self separate from your social self from your work self, without worrying about being followed around the Web.
Containers let you separate the different parts of your online life.
Containers made the jump from Test Pilot and are now available as an add-on for all Firefox users.
Contain yourselves! Create different containers for each of your online lives - your work self, your social self, your personal self - to stay organized and maintain privacy.

To allow you to see the status of your previously uploaded files, or delete them, basic information about your uploaded files are stored on your local device, such as Send’s identifier for the file, the filename, and the file’s unique download link. This is cleared if you delete your uploaded file or upon visiting Send after the file expires.
To help us improve the accuracy of our suggestions, we may retain a copy of submitted audio recordings, and related suggestion information. Audio recordings kept for this purpose will not be associated with any other personal identifiers.
To opt out of email updates, simply click the <em>unsubscribe</em> link on any Test Pilot email.
To provide Activity Stream, we fetch metadata about websites you have visited, such as images and icons, using a service called <a href="http://embed.ly/" target="_blank">Embedly</a>. We send these requests to Embedly through Mozilla's servers, so they will not be associated with you.

Voice Fill lets you speak your searches.
Voice Fill may offer you multiple options. Select the one you want to help train the AI.
Voice Fill will also collect information about your use of the feature, such as how frequently Voice Fill is used and whether you used Voice Fill with specific tabs or pages such as Google, DuckDuckGo, or Yahoo.
Voice Fill will collect technical information related to the performance of the feature, such as how long it takes for our servers to process a submitted recording and whether you selected or modified any of the suggestions we gave.
If you have the experiment installed, you will be updated automatically. Voice Fill will soon be available as an add-on for all Firefox users.
Watch results appear (like magic!) as you type your search into the URL bar.
Watch video in the foreground while you do other things on the Web.

We also collect basic information about your browser profile that affect Activity Stream, such as the number of bookmarks and history items.
We also collect data on the number of times you encounter a playable video, the number of times you played the video and the video service that provided the video. This helps us understand how useful our users are finding the experiment.
We are working on a full report. Check back soon for the details.

Welcome to Test Pilot!
Welcome to Test Pilot!
We put an icon in your toolbar so you can always find Test Pilot.
We're building next-generation features for Firefox. Install Test Pilot to try them!
We’re building the next generation of Firefox, and we’re focusing on real-world speed and performance. Pulse lets you give our engineers feedback about your experience on websites that work well in Firefox and on websites that don’t.
We recommend <a>disabling these add-ons</a> before activating this experiment:
Exceptions
We've also built great new app experiences like <a data-l10n-name="lockboxLink" title="{ -exp-lockbox }">{ -exp-lockbox }</a> and <a data-l10n-name="sendLink" title="{ -exp-send }">{ -exp-send }</a> which continue to push { -brand } beyond the browser. Look for exciting new developments from both of these projects in 2019.
We’ve built some basic formatting options into Notes. With your feedback we will add more features.
We will automatically disable the Universal Search experiment and report the results when it ends.
We will only send you Test Pilot-related information.
What would it be like to move tabs from the top of the browser to the side? We wanted to find out!
Please see <a>our documentation</a> for details. When running Test Pilot locally or in development environments, special configuration is required.
When you choose to use Voice Fill, your recordings will be sent to our servers for processing to provide you with suggested text.
When you use Send, Mozilla receives an encrypted copy of the file you upload, and basic information about the file, such as filename, file hash and file size. Mozilla does not have the ability to access the content of your encrypted file, and only keeps it for the time or number of downloads indicated.
Whoops!
Will you help us make Tracking Protection better? This experiment turns on Tracking Protection for all browsing and offers a quick way to report any issues you see as you browse.
Exceptions
With your generous participation and feedback, we’ve shaped { -brand } with amazing new features like <a data-l10n-name="containersLink" title="{ -exp-containers }">{ -exp-containers }</a>, <a data-l10n-name="activityStreamLink" title="{ -exp-activity-stream }">{ -exp-activity-stream }</a>, and <a data-l10n-name="screenshotsLink" title="{ -exp-screenshots }">{ -exp-screenshots }</a>.

Firefox Affiliates allows you to build banners and place them on your Facebook profile to encourage visitors to download Firefox. When a visitor to your page or status update clicks on a banner and visits the Firefox download page, you get credit for that click. While we do send out prizes and gifts to our Affiliates from time to time, Firefox Affiliates does not offer monetary rewards for hosting Firefox banners. Affiliates who get a lot of clicks through their profile will be featured on our leaderboard and be eligible for fun stuff like Firefox T-shirts and, if you opt in, we may feature your banner in a paid-ad on the Facebook ad network.

If enabled, &brandShortName; will automatically consider messages marked by this external classifier as junk.
If enabled, you must first train &brandShortName; to identify junk mail by using the Junk toolbar button to mark messages as junk or not. You need to identify both junk and non junk messages. After that &brandShortName; will be able to mark junk automatically.
If false, turn off hardware acceleration.

If your e-mail provider supports it, Customize From Address allows you to make a one-off minor alteration to your From address without having to create a new identity in Account Settings. For example, if your From address is John Doe <john@example.com> you may want to change it to John Doe <john+doe@example.com> or John <john@example.com>.
If you require encryption, to send a message you must have the public key or certificate of every recipient.
If you store this account's new mail in a different account's Inbox, you will no longer be able to access already downloaded e-mail for this account. If you have mail in this account, please copy it to another account first.\n\nIf you have filters that filter mail into this account, you should disable them or change the destination folder. If any accounts have special folders in this account (Sent, Drafts, Templates, Archives, Junk), you should change them to be in another account.\n\nDo you still want to store this account's e-mail in a different account?

In order to make it easier and safer to switch between installations of { -brand-product-name } (including { -brand-product-name }, { -brand-product-name } Beta, and { -brand-product-name } Daily), this installation now has a dedicated profile. It does not automatically share your saved information with other { -brand-product-name } installations.
In order to play back certain types of video content, { -brand-short-name } downloads certain content decryption modules from third parties.
In order to receive messages, you first need to set up an account.
In partnership with several providers, &brandShortName; can offer you a new email account. Just fill in your first and last name, or any other words you'd like, in the fields above to get started.

If you like Firefox’s tabbed browsing, you’re going to love tabbed email. Tabbed email lets you load emails in separate tabs so you can quickly jump between them. Perhaps you’re responding to an email and need to refer back to an earlier email. Tabbed email lets you keep multiple emails open for easy reference.

The Activity Manager records all the interactions between Thunderbird and your email provider in one place. There’s no more guess work. You only have to look in one place to see everything that’s happening with your email.
The attachment reminder looks for the word attachment (and other words like file types) in the body of your message and reminds you to add an attachment before hitting send.

Both of these projects are part of our efforts to bridge the digital speech divide. Voice recognition technologies bring a human dimension to our devices, but developers need an enormous amount of voice data to build them. Currently, most of that data is expensive and proprietary. We want to make voice data freely and publicly available, and make sure the data represents the diversity of real people. Together we can make voice recognition better for everyone.

Thunderbird for Organizations
Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring client, that’s easy to set up and customize. One of the core principles of Thunderbird is the use and promotion of open standards - this focus is a rejection of our world of closed platforms and services that can’t communicate with each other. We want our users to have freedom and choice in how they communicate.
Thunderbird is a free email application that’s easy to set up and customize - and it’s loaded with great features!
Thunderbird is an open source project, which means anyone can contribute ideas, designs, code, and time helping fellow users.

Thunderbird is both free and freedom respecting, but we’re also completely funded by donations! Help us sustain the project and continue to improve.
Thunderbird is currently transitioning to an independent organization. Being independent, we can shape our own fate, but there is significant infrastructure that must be maintained to deliver the application to our tens of millions of users. For Thunderbird to survive and continue to evolve, we need your support and ask for your donation today. All the money donated will go directly to funding Thunderbird development and infrastructure.

Thunderbird Look & Feel
Thunderbird makes email better for you, bringing together speed, privacy and the latest technologies. Focus on what matters and forget about complexity.
Thunderbird Nightly
Thunderbird offers support for user privacy and remote image protection. To ensure a user’s privacy, Thunderbird automatically blocks remote images in email messages.
Breton
Thunderbird protects you from email scams which try to trick users into handing over personal and confidential information by indicating when a message is a potential phishing attempt. As a second line of defense, Thunderbird warns you when you click on a link which appears to be taking you to a different Web site than the one indicated by the URL in the message.

Thunderbird’s funding goes toward the significant infrastructure and staff that must be maintained to deliver the application to our tens of millions of users.
Thunderbird’s popular junk mail tools have been updated to stay ahead of spam. Each email you receive passes through Thunderbird’s leading-edge junk mail filters. Each time you mark messages as spam, Thunderbird "learns" and improves its filtering so you can spend more time reading the mail that matters. Thunderbird can also use your mail provider’s spam filters to keep junk mail out of your inbox.
Thunderbird’s update system checks to see if you’re running the latest version, and notifies you when a security update is available. These security updates are small (usually 200KB - 700KB), giving you only what you need and making the security update quick to download and install. The automated update system provides updates for Thunderbird on Windows, macOS, and Linux in over 40 different languages.

What’s New
When quitting Thunderbird, visible tabs will be saved and will be restored when you open Thunderbird the next time. There is also a Tab menu on the Tab toolbar to help you switch between Tabs.
Who We Are
Why we need donations
With Add-ons (Extensions & Themes) and many more features you can change the look and feel of Thunderbird in an instant.
With Personas, lightweight "skins" allow you to change the look and feel of Thunderbird in an instant. Hundreds of skins are available from the latest movies, famous landmarks, and Japanese tattoos. You can also choose from several Themes that dress up all the different icons in Thunderbird.
You can also find calendars to subscribe to at <a href="%s">iCalShare.com</a>.
You can see details of all our changes in the release notes for <a href="%(release)s">Thunderbird 78.0 and up</a>.
Build a custom goal
Fortunately there is an active community keeping it running and developing it further. But to survive long term, the project needs funding. You might already know that Thunderbird improvements are no longer paid for by Mozilla.

Most of the data used by large companies isn’t available to the majority of people. We think that stifles innovation. So we’ve launched Common Voice, a project to help make voice recognition open and accessible to everyone.

Most speech databases are trained with an overrepresentation of certain demographics which results in a bias towards <articleLink>male and middle class</articleLink>. Accents and dialects that tend to be under-represented in training data sets are typically associated with groups of people who are already marginalised. Many machines also struggle to understand female voices. This is why in our voice database we want variety!
Mozilla doesn’t pick or favor any one language over another. Instead, Common Voice is a purely community-driven initiative, but it takes <multilangLink>several steps to add a new language</multilangLink> and begin collecting voice donations. First, the Common Voice website needs to be translated so community members can access the contributor experience in their own language. Next, we need a large collection of copyright-free sentences for people to read outloud. Once both of those requirements are satisfied a language is “launched” on Common Voice for people to start recording their voice and validating others donations. If you want to help launch a new language, head over to our <sentenceCollectorLink>sentence collection tool</sentenceCollectorLink> to get started.
Mozilla is dedicated to keeping the web open and accessible for everyone. To do it we need to empower web creators through projects like Common Voice. As voice technologies proliferate beyond niche applications, we believe they must serve all users equally well. We see a need to include more languages, accents and demographics when building and testing voice technologies. Mozilla wants to see a healthy, vibrant internet. That means giving new creators access to voice data so they can build new, extraordinary projects. Common Voice will be a public resource that will help Mozilla teams and developers around the world.

<speechBlogLink>Get Started with Speech Recognition</speechBlogLink>
Speech is often the most natural way we communicate with each other and voice technologies are bringing that convenience to our computers and mobile devices. We want to empower developers to build amazing voice recognition applications like real-time translators and voice-enabled digital assistants. But right now most of the voice data required to build these kinds of apps is expensive and proprietary. We hope the Common Voice dataset will give developers what they need to innovate and make speech technology available in their own language. To make voice recognition even more universal, we're collecting voice samples in widely spoken languages as well as those with a smaller population of speakers often underserved by commercial speech recognition services. Publishing a diverse dataset of voices will empower developers, entrepreneurs, and entire speech communities to address this gap themselves.

The Clip Graveyard consists of voice clips that didn't make it into the Common Voice dataset. Just like the dataset, the Clip Graveyard is available for download.
The clip has disrespectful or offensive language.
The Common Voice dataset complements Mozilla’s open source voice recognition engine Deep Speech. The first version of Deep Speech was released in November 2017 and has continued to evolve ever since. Together with the Common Voice dataset, we believe this open source voice recognition technology should be available to everybody. It’s our hope these technologies will enable developers to build a wave of innovative products and services.
The Common Voice dataset complements Mozilla’s open source voice recognition engine Deep Speech, which you can use to build speech recognition applications. Read our <githubLink>Github overview</githubLink> or join the <discourseLink>DeepSpeech Discourse</discourseLink> to learn how to get started.

The Common Voice Dataset contains hundreds of thousands of voice samples that help developers build voice recognition tools.
The Common Voice dataset is available for download under the <licenseLink>CC0</licenseLink> license on <datasetLink>our Datasets page</datasetLink>. You can also download several other publicly available datasets from the same page.
The Common Voice project is Mozilla’s initiative to help teach machines how real people speak.
The count of voice recording hours that have been validated by 2 out of 3 users with a vote of “Yes”. These mark progress toward the overall project 10k hours goal.
The count of voice recording hours we have collected so far.
The current sentences come from contributor donations, as well as dialogue from public domain movie scripts like <italic>It’s a Wonderful Life.</italic>
The dataset is available now on our <downloadLink>download page</downloadLink> under the <licenseLink>CC-0</licenseLink> license.
The goal of the Common Voice dataset is to enable anyone in the world to build speech recognition, speaker recognition, or any other type of application that requires voice data. A voice assistant is just one of many types of applications you could use the dataset to build.
The multi-language version of the Common Voice dataset is currently undergoing community supported bundling and cleaning. If you would like to help us bring Common Voice to new languages, go check out the <sentenceCollectorLink>Sentence Collection Tool</sentenceCollectorLink> for adding new sentences to the dataset, and Mozilla <pontoonLink>Pontoon</pontoonLink> for translating the website itself. New languages are added to Common Voice for voice contribution when 5000 approved sentences have been collected.
The number of recordings and which languages you contribute to will be public.

To make it into the Common Voice dataset, a voice clip must be validated by two separate users.
To make the Common Voice dataset as useful as possible we have decided to only allow source text that is available under a Creative Commons (CC0) license. Using the CC0 standard means its more difficult to find and collect source text, but allows anyone to use the resulting voice data without usage restrictions or authorization from Mozilla. Ultimately, we want to make the multi-language dataset as useful as possible to everyone, including researchers, universities, startups, governments, social purpose organizations, and hobbyists.

Voice Dataset, Ready for Download
Voice is natural, voice is human. It’s the easiest and most natural way to communicate. We want developers to be able to build amazing things from real-time translators to voice-enabled administrative assistants. But right now there isn’t enough publicly available data to build these kinds of apps. We hope that Common Voice will give developers what they need to innovate.
Voice is natural, voice is human. That’s why we’re excited about creating usable voice technology for our machines. But to create voice systems, developers need an extremely large amount of voice data.

Voice recognition technology could revolutionize the way we interact with machines, but the currently available systems are expensive and proprietary. Common Voice is a project to make voice recognition technology easily accessible to everyone. People donate their voices to a massive database that will let anyone quickly and easily train voice-enabled apps. All voice data will be available to developers.
In addition to the Common Voice dataset, we’re also building an open source speech recognition engine called Deep Speech. Voice recognition technology is revolutionizing the way we interact with machines, but the currently available systems are expensive and proprietary. Common Voice is part of Mozilla’s initiative to make voice recognition technologies better and more accessible for everyone. Common Voice is a massive global database of donated voices that lets anyone quickly and easily train voice-enabled apps in potentially every language. We're not only collecting voice samples in widely spoken languages but also in those with a smaller population of speakers. Publishing a diverse dataset of voices will empower developers, entrepreneurs, and communities to address this gap themselves.

The Mozilla Foundation’s education and advocacy efforts, which span several continents and reach millions of people, are supported by philanthropic donations.
For donors outside of the United States, please consult with your tax adviser about whether your donation is tax deductible.
Generally speaking, only long enough to do what we collected it for. Please refer to the <a id="a1">Mozilla Privacy Policy</a> for more details.

Certain situations may arise in which Mozilla requests that an add-on developer update their add-on within a given time period to address a major security issue or policy violation. We work with developers to reasonably accommodate their own schedules, but if the issue is of a serious enough nature, add-ons that cannot issue an update with the requested fix may be demoted from fully-reviewed status, disabled, or permanently removed from the site.
I have an idea of a button. How can I share it?
