it must be borne inmind that the Commission 's objective in the merger control field is to preserve asituation of effective competition on the markets , which it considers to be aguarantee of growth and thus of viable jobs .
the Community dimension of a merger or acquisition isassessed using thresholds based on the turnover of the companies involved.The most important are the worldwide threshold ( EUR 5 000 million ) and the Community @-@ wide threshold ( EUR 250 million ) .
since theentry into force of the merger regulation , the Commission has seen thenumber of notifications grow very rapidly , especially in recent years , when the annual rate of growth has been around 30 % .
Insome cases , the merger is prohibited ; not only would it create or strengthen adominant position , but the firms have also been unable to propose a solutionto the competition concerns raised by the Commission .

candidate countries will benefit for the first time from financing to cover activities that are similar to activities financed in EU Member States and regions under Cohesion Policy instruments .
components III , IV and V are open to candidate countries only ( namely the Republic of Croatia , the Republic of Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
by gaining first @-@ hand experience at running these programmes , they will be well placed to absorb future structural , cohesion and rural development funds once they become available to them .
a quick look at some of the projects financed under IPA Component III demonstrates their diversity as well as their strategic importance .
investment aid in candidate countries is only a fraction of the level of investment assistance available to Member States2 , but it places a strong emphasis on building institutions and structures for the future .
it gives business leaders and civil servants a crucial experience in devising and managing investment projects , preparing them for the time when they take on full control of Structural Fund programmes .
the project will serve a population of approximately 444 000 inhabitants
as a result of the Regional Development component of pre @-@ accession assistance , a precursor to the Structural and Cohesion Funds , a strategy document has been developed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
regional Policy and enlargement , moving up a gear through pre @-@ accession funding from the countries concerned , is responsible for running the programme , supported by a Secretariat staffed from both sides of the border .
in this context , projects related to the Roma people , or to shared river basins like the Danube and Tisza , could be developed in the IPA crossborder programmes and might have an influence far beyond the local , crossborder area .
in line with the aim of using these programmes to prepare for future Structural Funds implementation , the IPA crossborder programmes will mirror Structural Funds rules as closely as possible. is means firstly that the programmes are run on a multiannual basis .

they should also commit themselves explicitly to the development of a culture which recognises the importance of quality , and quality assurance , in their work . "
the purpose of a broader approach of this kind is not to focus primarily on individual institutions , but rather to monitor the whole system of initial teacher education .
in some countries , evaluation may be regarded as a single process consisting of one stage completed by persons inside an institution , and another stage carried out externally .
the " Standard for initial Teacher Education : benchmark Information " contains a set of benchmarks against which programmes can be considered and a set of expected features which students should have attained at the end of their programmes .
Germany : only evaluations of bachelor 's- and master 's @-@ type programmes are used for the purpose of accreditation ( or re @-@ accreditation ) .
in France , institutions for teacher education have to undergo one type of external evaluation that occurs at regular intervals and another whose frequency varies .
in teacher training colleges , internal evaluation is carried out by the college council , while the management team is typically responsible for the evaluation of teaching .
Cyprus : the Figure relates solely to the internal evaluation of colleges providing initial teacher education for primary education.Luxembourg : for secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
Iceland : ( 1 ) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
in nine countries , all or almost all of the five main players indicated in Figure 3.2 take part in internal evaluation .
in Estonia , the members of the committee for the evaluation of study programmes are appointed by the faculties or departments concerned .
in Greece , the faculty 's evaluation group should consist of teaching / research or educational staff holding the rank of professor or assistant professor , as well as a student representative .
the student self @-@ governing body may delegate a representative to the committee , subject to the approval of the council .
chapter 3 -Internal Evaluation of initial Teacher Education
however , the internal evaluation of teacher education must refer to existing national qualification frameworks for programmes that provide it . these include regulations , content guidelines and qualification standards .
in the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , the outcomes of the General Teaching Council for Scotland process will in turn feed back into the internal quality assurance processes of the university .
however , there is no explicit mention of this having to happen - simply an expectation that it will , as it is such an obvious thing to do .
Italy is the only country where the content of the teacher education curriculum is not taken into account in regulations on internal evaluation .
in Slovenia , the student opinion surveys used for internal evaluation usually include questions about various aspects of the course content , the appropriateness of the course workload and the teachers ' and assistants " ability to deliver the course .
although , in the internal evaluation of universities , school placements and partnerships with schools are not referred to directly , they are usually taken into account when preparing the selfevaluation report .
Greece : the information relates to the law on quality assurance in higher education issued in August 2005 .
the level of funding may also vary in accordance with the level of quality observed during external evaluation , as for example in the case of the United Kingdom ( England and Wales ) .
in most countries where the results of external evaluation are used to inform ( re- ) accreditation decisions , conditional or temporary accreditation may be awarded in the case of non @-@ compliance with accreditation requirements .
for schools in partnership with the institution concerned
Czech Republic : ( 1 ) relates to the annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that occurs prior to external evaluation .
Ireland : ( 1 ) relates to the external review of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teaching practice .
according to regulations , the results of annual internal evaluation must be available to the public , but the institution concerned decides whether or not to publish them .
Malta : internal evaluation results are usually made available to academic staff and students .
Poland : ( 1 ) relates to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training colleges .
in Estonia and Romania this practice is also recommended .
monitoring of the education system pursues several aims .
it implies the need for comprehensive information on the system as a whole .
Germany : only the results of external evaluations to ( re- ) accredit bachelor 's and master 's programmes ( which are being introduced in 12 of the 16 Länder ) are the subject of national reports and indicators .
professional development for teachers may have various aims and address a variety of needs , from nationally identified educational priorities to the particular needs of schools or individual teachers .
in the great majority of countries , all or almost all types of provider currently exist , except for some countries with only one or two providers , as illustrated in the examples below .
teacher unions or teacher associations
these two projects are currently being implemented .
in these two countries , regulations on both accreditation and evaluation apply for certain providers only , whereas for other providers , regulations on only one of the two procedures apply .
those referred to as " compulsory " in Figure 5.2 are common to all Autonomous Communities , whereas those termed " optional " reflect the situation of just some of them .
concerning external evaluation , the main procedures in the other countries are the analysis of a written plan and site visits .
in line with the decentralised structure of Germany and Spain , the bodies undertaking accreditation and / or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Autonomous Community to the next .
given the principle of cultural sovereignty in Germany , the general supervision of inservice teacher education is the task of the ministries in each of the 16 Länder .
as regards evaluation and accreditation of the workshops , courses and programmes offered by the various providers , many Länder have established or appointed central institutes or agencies for this task .
Finland : Inservice teacher education of at least 30 ECTS provided by higher education institutions may be accredited by the FINHEEC at the request of the provider .
it also decides whether to recognise qualification courses for practising teachers which are offered by institutions for initial teacher education during afternoons , weekends or summer .
an inspectorate for inservice teacher education exists only in Hungary ( the National Committee for In @-@ Service Teacher Training ) , where it participates in evaluation along with other bodies .
however , this does not necessarily mean that the issues mentioned in Figure 5.4 are not usually covered .
participants " opinions on the training they receive
Inservice teacher education abroad
the German @-@ speaking Community of Belgium , Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and / or accreditation of inservice teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education .
in Greece , external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme , while internal evaluation takes place three times a year , at the end of each phase of the programme ( three phases in total ) .
furthermore , the SuliNova Kht ( a non @-@ profit organisation ) monitors inservice teacher education programmes by means of a selfevaluation questionnaire .
in Poland , the ministry of education supervises and approves the National Centre of Inservice Training activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year .
every year , the Regional Educational Authorities ( kuratoria ) provide the ministry with the conclusions concerning the performance of inservice teacher education institutions in their respective region . another obligation of the REA
the Ministry has the right to control the accredited programmes during the period of accreditation ( three years ) , but so far no rules on the procedures have been prepared .
in Cyprus , although no regulations exist , evaluation findings are used for decision @-@ making with respect to the goals , processes and instructors of the programmes .
in the Netherlands , accreditation results are published on the website of the Nederlands @-@ Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie ( NVAO , or Accreditation Organisation of The Netherlands and Flanders ) .
the situation in some of these countries , which have planned to adapt procedures for evaluating teacher education , is the subject of the first section .
a limited number of countries are currently engaged in debates concerned with the quality of evaluation procedures in teacher education . such debates are described in the second section .
later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it , including professional standards , the skills of teachers and compulsory requirements as regards teacher education programmes .
in Italy , the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform . a decree on the definition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government .
in Latvia , improvements in the system of inservice teacher education , which are currently being discussed , are expected to involve the evaluation of providers and not just programmes .
qualification standards shape what goes into the curriculum of the teacher education programme and may be defined within the framework of official guidelines for initial teacher education .
standards : statements regarding an expected level of requirements and conditions against which quality is assessed , or which must be attained by institutions or students in order for them to be accredited or certified .

the modernisation of education and training systems to improve the quality and level of skills available in their labour markets are part of the solution to these problems .
its aim is to help create a common European security culture , to support the strategic debate by providing the best possible interface between Euro -pean decisionmakers and the diverse circles of non @-@ official specialists .
it was on this premise , and in the face of an escalating drug phenomenon , that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) was established in 1993 .
monitoring the drug situation
starting from a highly heterogeneous group of drugs observatories across different continents , the endeavour is to extract the essence of their experience and to transmit the final result in such a way that it can be reinterpreted in other realities and conditions .
since the mid @-@ 1990s , the concept of " evidence @-@ based policy @-@ making " has emerged as a new standard in public management ( see box below ) .
) , and with public and private international donors in the drugs field that want to evaluate the effectiveness of their grants and activities .
we must inform the reader of the following in relation to this publication :
• we do not offer a single model to be copied , but strategic and operational steps and an indication of the sorts of decisions that should be taken on the basis of a structured analysis of each national context .
a national drugs observatory ( NDO ) is an organisation that aims to provide - for its home country - factual , objective , reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and
) , and their consequences .
in 2000 , an international expert meeting held in Lisbon led to the adoption of a common reference framework for data collection and monitoring shared by international and
as such , and the fact that it is one of the instruments of the European approach on drugs ( its adoption and transposition at national level is mandatory for any country seeking future EU membership .
to further this effort , the OID is embarking on a collaborative endeavor with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction to develop a methodological tool to
it is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person ( see the reference to the " elevator pitch " in Chapter 6 ) .
for example , in the EU this can be carried out in the context of the national working groups that are often established for the implementation and development of each of the EMCDDA 's five key epidemiological indicators ;
however it is important to bear in mind that knowing " what needs to be done " does not mean that everything can be done , or done at the same time : these are merely long @-@ term goals .
this is one of the network 's critical roles ( see Figure 5 ) : it can help answer the question " how are we going to get where we want to be ? . "
• Carry out a formal review of data quality and availability at national level with an expert panel • compare results with international guidelines and standards
• working with quantitative data ; • analysing qualitative information ; • interpreting and putting together all sources of information .
6 working @-@ day and seasonal variation from a time series (
once the stakeholders have been identified , it is necessary for the NDO to make a first assessment of what could be their needs , how they could be met , and what are the resources / partnerships needed .
the information should be clear , with a level of detail that can be taken on board in their own practice , and provided in the national language ( s ) .
information covering a wide range of technical and methodological issues , structured and well documented contents , in a not @-@ too @-@ detailed format ( for instance , review of literature , analysis of a compilation of documents ) .
every time the answer to the " so what ? " question is not clear , it means that a product does not meet its objective or is not sufficiently well @-@ defined. ned .
for more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Annual Reports questionnaires ( ARQ ) and it had been regularly reported to the CND ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
• clarify the process for delivery and identify the end benefi ciary of your report ( the international organisation itself , or the national coordinating entity , or the Ministry of Health , or the national drugs coordinating body , etc . )
in countries where the NDO is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug coordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see Figure 7 ) :
when the NDO is about to produce a new output , it either sends a preliminary confidential note to the national drug coordinating body ( NDC ) - if relevant - or transmits the information through the normal channels .
• the organisational capabilities that are involved in the production process are not exclusively based within a single institution , but are depending from different institutions and partners ( co @-@ production ) " ( 3 ) .
• when it is set up , in order to identify existing resources and means , as well as clarify the mandate for its establishment ;
are the reports presented to national experts and to national data providers so as to ensure ownership of the results and a confrontation of the results of the data analysis with the experience of professionals working in the field ?
building a national drugs observatory : a joint handbook of their clients , needs assessments or programmes / projects evaluations that could be useful to understand the situation ?
however , when preparing the strategic plan , we recommend limiting the information to the objectives and the actions to be undertaken , which is the critical information for the choices to be made .
however , in the beginning , the estimated cost of the national drugs information network will not be known , and the NDO will not usually start by immediately collecting data through a national survey .
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the NDO 's capacity to deliver outputs and be accountable for the use of funds .
if the NDO is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
there are no institutional models to be copied - it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal .

looking back at this long process , there seemed to be a need to formalise the experiences in the field , and to identify some key concepts and principles that remain valid irrespective of country or region .
the Inter @-@ American Drug Abuse Control Commission ( CICAD ) was established by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) in 1986 as the western hemisphere 's policy forum on all aspects of the drug problem .
the 2007 ESPAD report substance use among students in 35 countries
summary performed in 7 out of 16 federal states ( Bundesländer ) while the Belgian data collection was restricted to the Dutch speaking part ( Flanders ) .
country sample sizes were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
in all ESPAD countries at least two thirds of the students have drunk alcohol at least once during their lifetime , with an ESPAD average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited comparability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
the total amount of alcohol consumed during the last drinking day is usually low in countries where the students drink often , for example in Greece , and the other way around for countries with low consumption frequencies .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited comparability ) , the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom .
in the latter period this is especially true among girls , with an increase from 35 to 42 % .
lifetime use of magic mushrooms was reported by 3 % while GHB and steroids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same magnitude as reported experience of intravenous drug use .
in the two top @-@ prevalence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Isle of Man ) one in six students reported cannabis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular cannabis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @-@ 2 % in Armenia , the Faroe Islands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @-@ prevalence countries are most often found in western Europe .
countries where many students report past 30 days cannabis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try cannabis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illicit drugs at least once during their lifetime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @-@ year cannabis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing cannabis @-@ related problems , and the average prevalence of high @-@ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from cannabis were found , and the percentage of high @-@ risk users in a population corresponds to the cannabis use prevalence rates in the single countries .
on average , slightly more girls than boys report nonprescribed use of these drugs ( 8 % versus 5 % ) and in the top eight countries , twice as many girls as boys did so .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @-@ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall upward trend when the period is considered all in all .
since there is a high co @-@ variation between illicit drug use and cannabis use on the country level , quite naturally the development for lifetime cannabis use is more or less the same as described for all illicit drugs above .
the overall substance @-@ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the variable in focus .
the Faroe Islands could also be included in the list , even though it lacks information for two of the variables .
summary western Europe and countries displaying increases are often found in eastern Europe .
a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illicit drug use is rising .
and tangible progress has been made . this has meant that European policymakers have had to make difficult choices , and they have largely done so after carefully studying the available evidence .
nearly 25 % of opioid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more , with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20 .
overall range 0.8 % to 11.3 %
it would be wrong to conclude that the signs of stabilisation in use of cocaine will necessarily result in a stabilisation in the extent of problems attributed to use of this drug .

it is continuous because the European Commission , with the support of the EMCDDA and Europol , will present annual progress reviews .
finally , the process will be participative , involving an evaluation steering group whose task will be to define the methodology , output and provisional calendar .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe gives a precise definition of serious offences and covers the laundering of the proceeds of such offences , including financing of terrorist activities .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
possession of more than 10 doses must be charged under Section 172 , which , depending on the aggravating circumstances , provides for prison sentences ranging from four years to life .
difficulties in defining the quantity of a single dose and evidence that the exception has been misused in court to benefit drug dealers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annulment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint directive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutors @-@ General dealt with cannabis @-@ related infringements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offenders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guideline on cannabis , " according to which possession of up to 10 grams of cannabis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
the aforementioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sentencing of over 1 800 cases in six different Länder ( Schäfer and Paoli , 2006 ) .
other sentencing statistics showed that the waiving of reports as statutory alternatives to punishment increased in 2004 , though police reports and convictions increased further , while the number of suspended proceedings dropped slightly .
in Romania , court sentencing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social reintegration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the sanction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed compulsory treatment , effectively decreasing the involvement of the probation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
statistics on sentencing , or avoidance of sentencing , give a far more accurate picture of the implementation of a country 's drug policy than does the text of the laws ( see EMCDDA , 2002a ) .
they reflect differences in national legislation , but also the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced , and differences in the priorities and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences .
countries where this is the case , cannabis @-@ related offences in 2004 accounted for 34 @-@ 87 % of all drug law offences .
chapter 1 : policies and laws at presenting a first insight into this emerging phenomenon in the European Union .
the role of mass media campaigns is increasingly being seen as one of raising awareness ( to underpin , support and explain to the population at large the rationale underlying environmental strategies ) rather than one of changing behaviour .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical guidance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @-@ based prevention ( e.g. in France and Ireland ) .
in this regard , it is helpful that the concept of selective prevention does not focus on drug use and does not stigmatise drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulnerability in a broader sense .
several Member States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
in order to evaluate the level of implementation of the strategy , it is important to determine levels of service provision and the extent to which the services are being used .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe of the epidemiological situation that has been achieved by the EMCDDA @-@ driven development and implementation of indicator @-@ based monitoring , standardised reporting on responses is limited .
although the overall provision of substitution treatment remains low in these countries , there are some indications of increases in Estonia , Lithuania and Bulgaria .

in the new central European Member States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @-@ injectors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent infectious disease .
Danish and Estonian policies widen the target groups even more and include groups in close contact with drug users .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing infectious disease are clearly geared towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for delivering medical and social services .
a similar specialised programme for amphetamine users is reported from Spain , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
an initiative in this direction is the joint EMCDDA @-@ correlation project , supported by experts from the national focal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the 2005 @-@ 08 action plan calls on Member States to " improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes . "
nonetheless , no clear consensus currently exists across Europe on the cost and benefits of this approach and it remains an area where there is considerable political and scientific debate .
the main provider of funds is to be found at state / national level in 11 countries , whereas funding is predominantly at regional / local level in eight countries .
the service most commonly offered to homeless problem drug users is access to " generic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries combine the two systems .
all the available literature and facts and figures from Member States converge towards the same truth : the life situations of drug users are far more problematic and precarious than those of the general population .
thus , in the last two EU drug action plans , social reintegration has been one of the ultimate aims in order to improve the health and social status of drug users .
participation in ESPAD has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU Member States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
the survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illicit drugs , with the standard time frames , and frequency of use .
50 % in the Czech Republic , Spain and France (
the lowest lifetime prevalence estimates ( less than 10 % ) occur in Greece , Cyprus , Sweden , Romania , Turkey and Norway ( 61 ) .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( EMCDDA , 2004a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily cannabis users .
other countries are also working on scales to assess intensive forms of cannabis use ( Germany , Netherlands , Poland and Portugal ) , and the EMCDDA is promoting collaboration in this area .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in adolescents seeking treatment for cannabis use who have coexisting mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influencing demand for treatment ( 78
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe prevention for young people should not focus on cannabis alone , but should be aimed at preventing use of alcohol and tobacco too .
brief interventions are cost @-@ effective and may be particularly appropriate to cannabis users , as they are found to work well with drug users who :
the average purity of amphetamine in 2004 varied from
93 and EUR 63 per gram , while its average purity (
total number of tablets analysed in 2004 .

) at EU level declined in

1 14 from 0.3 % to 12 % , with the Czech Republic ( 12 % ) and Estonia ( 6.1 % ) reporting the highest figures ( Figure 5 ) .
reports about acute or chronic health problems requiring medical interventions relating to the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hallucinogenic substances by young people .
this is a common feature of hallucinogenic drug use and reflects the fact that young people generally choose to confine this type of drug use the misuse of these drugs for recreational purposes ( 130 ) .
in March 2001 the UN drug control system added GHB to the list of internationally controlled drugs , and as a result all EU Member States have been updating their legislation on this substance .
the shortage of prevalence data on GHB and ketamine suggests that use of these substances has stabilised at low levels in most countries .
however , the absence of accurate and comparable systems for recording deaths and non @-@ fatal emergencies related to the use of these substances limits the data available in this area .
the decision broadens the scope of , and replaces , the 1997 joint action ( 3 ) , which was devoted exclusively to new synthetic drugs .
assessment and control of new psychoactive substances was published in the Official Journal of the European Union ( OJ L 127 , 20.5.2005 , pp. 32 @-@ 37 ) and took effect on 21 May 2005 .

annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe better identified by focusing the analysis on groups in which drug use is concentrated , in particular young people living in urban areas .
the value of prevention and harm reduction approaches to reducing the risks associated with cocaine use remains largely unexplored , but a number of areas may have potential for the development of this kind of approach .
Netherlands ( 167 ) . the average purity of heroin products has been fluctuating in most reporting countries ( 168 ) since 1999 , making it difficult to identify any overall trend .
for example , in countries with a high proportion of stimulant users ( the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) , the rates of injecting among heroin users might not be representative of the overall situation .
despite their importance for public health , few countries provide estimates of injecting drug use at national
in some EU @-@ 15 Member States from which data are available ( Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom ) , rates of injecting among heroin users in treatment have declined .
those of the USA ( 185
41 % of a sample of 964 in 2001 to 54 % of 350 in 2005 ) and exceptionally high in another ( Kohtla @-@ Järve : 90 % out of 100 ) .
in Latvia , two time series of seroprevalence data among IDUs show a continued increase until 2002 / 03 while a third series suggests a decrease since the peak in 2001 .
in the Nordic region , the great majority of notified acute cases of hepatitis B occur among IDUs , and hepatitis B outbreaks have coincided with increases in drug injecting in several countries .
in Finland , hepatitis B notifications among IDUs have fallen steeply in recent years , possibly as a result of vaccination programmes and a comprehensive needle and syringe exchange system .
chapter 7 : Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
the purchase of syringes through pharmacies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some injectors , and the potential to exploit this contact point as a conduit to other services clearly exists .
mortality and drugrelated deaths
the study found a very high mortality among opioid users compared with their peers : 6 @-@ 20 times higher among males and 10 @-@ 50 times higher among females .
methadone deaths and Finland .
the EMCDDA figures include a few deaths among those over 65 years , with only seven countries reporting that more than 5 % of cases fall into this age group ( 203 ) .
deaths due to buprenorphine poisoning appear to be rare , a fact that is attributed to the agonist @-@ antagonist pharmacological characteristics of this drug .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreases in the numbers of drugrelated deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment availability and harm reduction initiatives , although declines in the prevalence of drug use may also be important .
210 which should be considered as a minimum estimate (
although interpretations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of drugrelated deaths in some countries , these patterns could be related to the trends in heroin injection ( 209 ) .
research into the circumstances of overdoses has supported the development of interventions that target high @-@ risk situations or high @-@ risk individuals .
such measures may achieve an important reduction in the deaths attributable to the immediate effects of drug taking .
the data that do exist indicate that many deaths involving cocaine also involve opioids .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe methadone substitution treatment is not currently considered a major response to reduce overdose deaths .
however , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
nonetheless , it is linked to the various concepts of addiction by the understanding that someone behaving in this way is very likely to fall within the more general concept of a " problem user . "
in terms of the current implementation of the PDU indicator across the EU , countries have adapted the definition to cover the practicalities of their local situation and the position is therefore heterogeneous .
a further step in developing our ability to understand better the European drug problem is to explore the extent to which intensive drug use can be incorporated into the monitoring exercise , beyond PDU monitoring .
these kinds of indirect statistical methods complement population survey work , which , for a range of methodological and practical reasons , is less suitable for estimating the prevalence of drug use that is of low prevalence , stigmatised and largely hidden .
a second drug with a functional or pharmacological rationale is not confined to simultaneous use but may also be used consecutively , as a replacement or as a complementary drug .
as such , it is an important component in understanding the European drug problem as a whole .
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
moreover , it should be borne in mind that these figures do not reflect the social costs of drug use .
the general principle that those in prison should have access to the same healthcare options as are available in the wider community is not achieved in many areas for those with drug problems .
but , even more so than among the population in general , it is by far the most commonly consumed illicit drug by young and very young people .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison settings .
although some Member States have introduced schemes to divert offenders with drug problems into treatment as an alternative to criminal sanctions , those with drug problems continue to account for a significant
Europe remains the main global market for cannabis resin , most of which is produced in North Africa . herbal cannabis is also available in Europe ,
Coordinated actions against cocaine trafficking are growing in Europe , and a new intergovernmental task force is to be located in Portugal , which appears appropriate given the country 's growing importance in cocaine interdiction .
requests for drug treatment for those with cocaine problems are rising .
in 2005 , cocaine was the primary drug of about 13 % of clients demanding treatment , and in an even higher proportion of those new to treatment ( 22 % ) .
the number of new treatment demands reported has roughly tripled over the last five years , and now stands at over 33 000 .
the EMCDDA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
increased prevalence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest prevalence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Worryingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @-@ 6 % in 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds ) .
the situation in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania remains a
across Europe , HCV rates are high among injecting populations , and studies show that young injectors continue to acquire this disease early in their drug @-@ using careers , limiting the opportunities for intervention .
reductions in cultivation can be achieved quickly but are reversed equally quickly .
overdose deaths constitute a significant cause of avoidable mortality among young adults .
this approach , which has been in place in other Member States ( e.g. Spain , Ireland , the United Kingdom ) for some time , is becoming more widespread and has also been implemented in the current EU action plan on drugs .
in none of these cases was this the first such exercise , and in each of these cases the national reports mentioned that the new drug policy documents had benefited from the experience of earlier ones .
a noticeable trend in recent years has been the shift from a single national planning document to the adoption of two complementary instruments : a strategic framework and an action plan .
the new regulation clarifies the countries to which the EMCDDA can transfer its know @-@ how , at the request of the European Commission and with the approval of the Management Board .
national drug strategies and action plans generally include interventions in the areas of prevention , treatment and rehabilitation , harm reduction and supply reduction . the extent of the different interventions and the importance given
there is also some activity in the area of developing indexes designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
however , a study commissioned by the EMCDDA has shown that it is possible to assess Coordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Coordination outcomes ( Kenis , 2006 ) .
the conceptualisation of both instruments has involved interesting methodological developments and has allowed a first insight into the use of overall indexes to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .
at the regional or local level , drug Coordination agencies and / or drug coordinators exist in most countries .
and Norway . based on the data supplied by these six countries , the total drug @-@ related public expenditure by European countries is calculated to lie somewhere between

the few references to neuroscientific research are primarily Dutch ; however , the French MILDT has also financed a series of research projects in this area .
taking peer @-@ reviewed scientific publications as an indicator of scientific activity , an analysis of such publications during 2005 and 2006 and quoted in the national reports reveals a pattern of thematic research priorities that varies between countries .
EU funding for drug @-@ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @-@ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .

approximately half ( 53 % ) of the outpatient clients are treated for primary opioid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular cannabis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .

it aims to evaluate the impact of drug treatment on a range of outcome measures and focuses on the analysis of which types of treatment pathways produce the best outcomes for particular subgroups of drug users .
however , it is of particular importance for the target group as it provides not only economic stability but also self @-@ esteem , status and a regular rhythm of life .
new ways of getting clients into paid work include forming partnerships with private enterprises , mentoring schemes and providing incentives such as Subsidising trainees " wages or giving business start @-@ up loans .

despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lifetime prevalence rates in the range 10 @-@ 25 % ( 32
and , the approach of restricting attention to use in the last month does not allow estimates of the number of intensive users to be made with any precision .
however , this still provides only a blunt tool for identifying those who are suffering problems or dependence because of their use of cannabis .
however , last year prevalence levels among young adults ( 16 @-@ 34 ) stabilised from 1998 and have fallen between 2003 and 2006 ( 20.0 % to 16.3 % ) .
levels of cannabis use in France , Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom prevalence levels in recent years ( 2002 , 2003 and 2005 respectively ) , following a period of steady increases .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s onwards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable insight into trends over time .
see Tables TDI @-@ 22 and TDI @-@ 23 ( part i ) and ( part IV ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
there are differences between countries in the frequency of cannabis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily cannabis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
concerns have been raised that it may be inappropriate to treat young cannabis users in general drug services if this leads to clients
in 2005 , however , a majority of reporting countries recorded a downward trend in the number of amphetamine seizures made . this picture
the ecstasy seized in Europe in 2005 is reported to come from these two countries and to a lesser extent from Poland and the United Kingdom .

although small in number , crack cocaine users are likely to be at particularly high risk of experiencing problems and may be difficult to engage in treatment and other services .
detecting trends in both price and purity is hampered by a lack of consistent data , and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries ( 118 ) .
generally , the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance .
for EU countries where estimates of problem opioid use were available for 2005 , the extent of substitution treatment among problem opioid users was calculated ( Figure 10 ) .
the percentage of all drug treatment demands accounted for by all heroin requests has fallen , decreasing from 74 % in 1999 to 61 % in 2005 . the only countries not reporting a decrease are Bulgaria and the

most clients ( 60 % ) report initiation of opioid use before the age of 20 ; first use of opioids after the age of 25 was very uncommon ( 133 ) .

" drug @-@ induced deaths " and " acute drug deaths " ( 155 ) .
although the comparability of European data has improved in recent years , differences in the quality of reporting between countries still mean that direct comparisons should be made with caution .
in Europe , most opioid deaths are related to heroin , but often other substances are also identified as having possibly played a role , in particular alcohol , benzodiazepines , or other opioids and , in some countries , cocaine .

a collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project found that opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their peers of the same age ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) .
suggested to account for this recent increase , among which are polydrug use by opioid users , or a possible increase in the availability of heroin .
there is a marked discrepancy in trends in drug @-@ related deaths between the EU @-@ 15 Member States and those who have joined since 2004 .
the European project Isadora ( " integrated services aimed at dual diagnosis and optimal recovery from addiction " ) was concluded in 2005 after a three @-@ year research period ( 1 ) .
easier accessibility of treatment and greater variety of approaches , including substitution treatment , improve rates of retention in treatment , which makes an important contribution to reducing drug @-@ related deaths and mortality .
a longitudinal study on the effectiveness of treatments for heroin addiction , which will examine the association between retention in treatment and mortality , is currently underway in Italy ( Bargagli et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from opioid drugs are at an elevated risk of an overdose , if they relapse back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
an approach that has generated some controversy is the provision of drug consumption rooms , whereby drug users may consume their drugs in a designated space where

this report is only possible through the hard work and dedication of our partners in the Reitox network of national focal points and the experts throughout Europe who have contributed to the analysis .
a strong voice from Europe in an important year for reflection and policy formation the user is often difficult , and Member States vary greatly in how they have drawn the line between these two categories .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @-@ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) .
this makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflections on how drug policies have performed to date , and what directions should be pursued in the future .
however , the view held by some that , for drug users and particularly cannabis users , the likelihood of being charged with drug offences has decreased in recent years is not supported by the data .
this distinction has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .

drug use prevention : evidence base grows but practice is slow to change up employment is one of the key elements of achieving reintegration in to society , and it has been shown to be of high prognostic value .
an important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care tailored to the needs of a more heterogeneous population of drug users .
the portal , which includes a prevention module , provides an overview of the latest evidence on programme efficacy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interventions .
examples of evaluated practices across Europe are also provided .
recent data from school and adult population surveys suggest that overall cannabis use has stabilised or is declining in some countries .

Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fifty times higher than that found among the general population .
relatively high levels of initiation also appear to be still occurring in some Member States , as indicated by studies among injecting drug users that show a relatively high proportion of young and new injectors .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs took place in 2008 , with input from the EU Member States , Europol and the EMCDDA .
some examples of this diversity are highlighted in Chapter 2 .
in 2008 , 13 EU Member States have already redrafted or are due to review and redraft their national drugpolicy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policymaking at national level .
chapter 1 : policies and laws countries highlights the need to adopt a common approach towards monitoring the social cost of drug use in Europe .
these expenditures are not necessarily labelled as drugrelated in official accountancy documents .
the changes in drug users " access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features . first , they all widen the scope for directing drug users in to treatment .
in the period 2004 @-@ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @-@ enacted it after 12 years without , and the UnitedKingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal definitions of personal use were widened from a maximum of one dose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 doses .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established

though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
most legislative activity has concentrated on those taking drugs and then driving ( Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Spain , France , Latvia , Lithuania , Portugal , Finland ) .

due to the specific profile of the Baltic States and Romania with regard to HIV / AIDS , international donors continue to play an important role in these countries .
after methadone , buprenorphine is the second most commonly prescribed opioid substitute , and its use in the treatment of opioid dependence has increased in recent years ( see Chapter 6 ) .

Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of inmates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of inmates have injected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
helping drug treatment clients find employment is a key element in social reintegration , as one in every two clients entering treatment is unemployed ( 28 ) .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wales in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
however , there is no such entitlement if the offender is expected to be released within three months or is considered unfit or not motivated for treatment .
in the early and mid @-@ 1990s a few countries stood out as having a high prevalence , whereas the European norm was levels of use which , by today 's standards , were low .
cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultivated in 172 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
the area under cannabis resin production declined from 134 000 hectares in 2003 to and the Netherlands have been noted as source countries
seizures of cannabis resin in Europe exceed herbal seizures both in terms of number and quantity : with twice as many seizures ( 325 000 ) and the amount intercepted ( 713 tonnes ) eight times higher .

as with lifetime experience , there is a wide variation between countries in estimates of use in the last 30 days among school students .
in some countries it is virtually unreported , whereas in others around 15 % of those questioned report use during the last 30 days , with sometimes even higher figures found among males .
after tobacco and alcohol , cannabis also continues to be the psychoactive substance most commonly used by school students .
data from the 2005 / 06 HBSC survey of 15 @-@ year @-@ olds showed large variation in lifetime prevalence of cannabis use across 27 countries .
estimating intensive and long @-@ term patterns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .
the comparison shows that , on average , students who have used cannabis are more likely to have used other substances .
in an Australian study , 92 % of long @-@ term cannabis users were classified as having been dependent at some point in their life , with more than half of them judged to be dependent at the time of the study .
a follow @-@ up study carried out one year later suggested that , among long @-@ term users , measures of cannabis use and dependence may be stable for this length of time ( Swift et al . , 2000 ) .
among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , cannabis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .

higher prevalence levels in some countries need to be understood in the context of , in simple terms at least , two distinct consumption patterns . in a limited number of
Stimulant markets in Europe : the relative prevalence of cocaine or amphetamines in seizures and population surveys , and the proportion of drug users in treatment reporting these substances as primary drugs
last year use of amphetamines in this age group ranges from 0.1 % to 2.9 % , with the majority of countries reporting prevalence estimates of between 0.7 % and 1.9 % .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe been reported by Latvia and Denmark , while in Sweden and Finland the percentage of new amphetamine clients declined , possibly suggesting an ageing population ( 67 ) .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of methamphetamine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Griffiths et al . , 2008 ) .
countries with sufficient data on last year prevalence of amphetamine use among the 15 @-@ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .
data from a few countries suggest that cocaine could be replacing amphetamines and ecstasy among some sectors of the drug @-@ using population . this may be the
analysis of the number of laboratories dismantled suggests that most production remains located in these three countries , although it may also occur in other South American countries , before exportation to the main consumer markets in North America and Europe .

UnitedKingdom ( 87 ) .
similarly , in Italy , in 2006 , there were estimated to be between 3.7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
elsewhere in Europe , cocaine accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of all treatment demands ( 10 countries ) or less than 5 % ( 12 countries ) ( 93 ) .
a multi @-@ city European study with targeted samples of cocaine users in nine cities ( Prinzleve et al . , 2004 ) found
overall the estimated lifetime prevalence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the USA .
in 2006 , around 8 000 crack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the UnitedKingdom ( 102 ) .
frequent users had a seven times higher risk of non @-@ fatal myocardial infarctions than nonusers ( Qureshi et al . , 2001 ) .
of the Member States that report high prevalence levels of cocaine or crack cocaine , several have been particularly active in responding to this problem .
in 2007 , Spain introduced a specific national action plan on cocaine , while Ireland implemented and evaluated a number of specific programmes aimed at different groups of cocaine users .
in Italy , a largescale clinical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmaceuticals ( aripiprazole and ropinirole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
for example , the incentive could be vouchers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abstinence . in this scenario , failure to stay drugfree results in the loss of the accumulated gains .
according to a recent UnitedKingdom report ( nice , 2007 ) , cocaine @-@ related problems in British specialised treatment centres appear to be only addressed when the primary drug problem is related to opioids .
once administered , the vaccine induces the production of antibodies that bind to cocaine molecules in the bloodstream and , thereby , allow naturally occurring enzymes to convert them in to inactive molecules .
Reitox national focal points .
for example , in some countries where problem opioid use has historically predominated , recent reports suggest that other drugs including cocaine are growing in importance .
estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use at national level during the period 2002 @-@ 06 range roughly between one and six casesper1000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ;
from the relatively limited data available , an estimated average prevalence of problem opioid use of between four and five casesper1000 of the population aged 15 @-@ 64 can be derived .
assuming this reflects the EU as a whole , it implies some 1.5 million ( 1.3 million to 1.7 million ) problem opioid users in the EU and Norway in 2006 .
treatment found that primary opioid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
most drug clients entering outpatient treatment for primary opioid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other opioids ( 23 % ) and cannabis ( 18 % ) .
of the 387 000 treatment requests reported in 2006 ( data available from 24 countries ) , heroin was recorded as the principal drug in 47 % of cases for which the primary drug is known .
Buprenorphine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
in Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of opioids other than heroin or methadone : mainly buprenorphine , painkillers and other opioids ( 112 ) .
figure 8 : estimates of the prevalence of injecting drug use ( casesper1000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ) an increase in the proportion of polydrug users among heroin clients and arise in the number of clients using opioids other than heroin .
the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the prevalence of injecting drug use .
among opioid users entering outpatient treatment for the first time in 2006 , a slightly lower proportion report injecting the drug ( around 40 % ) .
see Tables PDU @-@ 104 , TDI @-@ 4 , TDI @-@ 5 and TDI @-@ 17 ( part V ) in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
the varying levels of new injectors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initiation as well as increasing injecting incidence among the younger or the older populations .
a simple comparison of the estimates of the number of problem opioid users and the reported number of treatments delivered suggests that more than one in three could be receiving substitution treatment .
Opioid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment than other clients ( see Chapter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequency of co @-@ morbid psychiatric disorders is noted .
about half of opioid users seeking treatment report initiation before the age of 20 and around one third between the age of 20 and 24 years ; first use of opioids after the age of 25 is uncommon ( 120
a buprenorphine / naloxone combination was launched on the EU market in 2006 as an alternative to buprenorphine alone , with the aim of reducing the potential and attractiveness for injecting use .
additionally , a randomised trial of injectable opioids ( RIOTT ) is currently underway in the UnitedKingdom which will assess the effectiveness of injectable diamorphine , injectable methadone and oral methadone .
substitution treatment , generally integrated with psychosocial care , is typically provided at specialised outpatient centres and in shared @-@ care arrangements with office @-@ based general practitioners . the available data
treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
however , a report issued by the European Commission ( 2007a ) highlighted the lack of services for drug users available in prisons and drew attention to the importance of intervening in this setting .
reviews of randomised controlled trials and observational studies conclude that methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) and buprenorphine maintenance treatment ( BMT ) can both be effective for the management of opioid dependence .
more positively , prison drug programmes have become more widespread , and new initiatives are reported by many countries .
in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnosed infections related to injecting drug use with trends in HIV prevalence among IDUs suggests that the incidence of HIV infection related to injecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .
however , vigilance is needed as some Member States continue to show high rates of new HIV infections linked to injecting drug use , and the situation is even more worrying in some neighbouring countries .
HCV antibody levels among national samples of IDUs in 2005 @-@ 06 vary from around 15 % to 90 % , with most countries typically reporting levels in excess of 40 % .
the proportion of IDUs among all notified cases of hepatitis B may have declined slightly in some countries , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vaccination programmes targeted at IDUs .
prisons are important settings for interventions targeting infectious diseases related to drug use and for providing healthcare to a population that is otherwise hard to reach ( see Chapter 2 ) .
moreover , many druginduced deaths are , in fact , polydrug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
there are also deaths related to drugs , but due to circumstantial reasons ( e.g. violence related to the drug trade ) .
however , other approaches are being explored whereby data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attributable to drugs in a community ( see " Overall drugrelated mortality , " P . 86 ) .
improvements in the quality and reliability of European data in recent years have allowed better descriptions of overall and national trends , and most countries have now adopted a case definition in line with that of the
the role of cocaine in these deaths may not always be identified , and they may not be reported as cocaine @-@ related .
a recent Norwegian study of a cohort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 189 recorded deaths , overdoses , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
cohort studies area valuable tool for estimating and understanding the overall mortality related to drug use , but other approaches can help improve the understanding of the issue and provide an overview at national level .
however , in 2007 , the United Kingdom 's Department of Health issued new guidelines on clinical management of drug misuse and dependence , setting out specific actions for the prevention of drugrelated deaths .

furthermore , we make a commitment that the identification of what constitutes effective practice in the drugs field will form an increasingly important part of the EMCDDA 's future activities .
a common theme running through this report is the dynamic nature of the drug problem , and we need to ensure that our vision keeps pace with the changing conditions with which we are confronted .
the USA , for example , softened its approach to the provision of sterile injecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @-@ borne infections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @-@ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @-@ term data .
a lesson that has emerged from a number of countries is that the involvement of general practitioners can contribute to an expansion of treatment provision .
in addition , developments in neuroscience have not only improved our understanding of the biological mechanisms of addiction , but are now beginning to facilitate some innovative approaches .

a caveat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
heroin and cocaine : no strong signs of a diminishing problem trend in heroin @-@ related problems is no longer sustained .
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the epidemic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems arising from the use of this drug are considerable .
in drug prevention , it has long been understood that substance use problems are best addressed holistically and in the context of healthy lifestyles and informed choices .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @-@ dimensional perspective is becoming increasingly unhelpful in understanding the developing nature of patterns of substance use in Europe .
in Europe today , polydrug patterns are the norm , and the combined use of different substances is responsible for , or complicates , most of the problems we face .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly devalued if they simply open the door for the use of a substitute , which may be even more damaging .
there is little to suggest an improving situation in the use of heroin and cocaine , the two substances that remain at the heart of Europe 's drug problem .
it will be interesting to see if the future brings more concrete evidence of a decrease in the availability of this drug after recent reports of a decline in global cocaine production .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreases , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and proportion of treatment demands related to opioid drugs .
data on drugrelated deaths , which are largely associated with heroin use , also provide no indication of a return to the decreasing trend observed prior to 2004 .
Worryingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be diffusing into new populations .
the illicit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes , new products and marketing opportunities , as well as demonstrating the ability to adapt quickly to control measures .
the situation in Nordic countries adds to concerns about the possible outward diffusion of methamphetamine use beyond the Czech Republic .
changes in the ecstasy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals , and these efforts may also have important
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @-@ based products , in particular herbal mixtures , as well as merchandise containing synthetic compounds .
new substances appearing on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world , to experimental chemicals synthesised in laboratories and untested in humans .
the enforcement of drug prohibition is judged by the study to have caused substantial unintended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e.g. geographical displacement of production and trafficking ) .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial cooperation between Member States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
moreover , the fact that most national drug policy documents contain objectives that echo those of the EU action plan was noted as evidence of increasing convergence among European countries in the field of drug policy .
a relative stabilisation of Europe 's drug situation in recent years was also observed , but the contribution of the EU action plan to this trend could not be determined .
a better reflection of the balanced approach between demand and supply reduction is also pursued in external agreements and programmes .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor , with only about half the number of objectives ( 24 ) and fewer actions ( 72 ) .
evaluator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of reflection in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
national drug strategies and action plans
in 2008 , new drug policy documents ( 6 ) were adopted by Greece , France and the United Kingdom .
a key priority of the plan is to dissuade young people from beginning to use drugs by reaffirming the prohibition of drug use and informing young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of nongovernmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the preparatory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
most countries could provide data on central government expenditure , and seven also reported expenditure by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
in some cases , the final report is a summary of annual implementation reviews ; in others , there is an attempt to get a deeper understanding of the implementation process , of the effectiveness or of the impact of the policy .
of the 23 countries providing data for 2007 , 16 reported only labelled expenditure .
nevertheless , attempts to establish links between drug strategies or action plans and indicators of the drug situation have been made by some European countries .
estimating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illicit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .
in contrast , for those countries providing COFOG data for unlabelled
during this period , about a quarter of the texts authorised or regulated the use of substances such as methadone and buprenorphine .
in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exempts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of syringes dispensed .
in 2000 , the United Kingdom introduced a minimum sentence of 7 years " imprisonment for a third conviction of trafficking in class A drugs , and in 2001 Greece

European countries referred to more than 350 research projects undertaken or published in 2007 and 2008 in the latest Reitox national reports .
the chapter ends with a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
both selective and indicated prevention acknowledge that problem drug use is concentrated in vulnerable groups or individuals with limited social and personal opportunities ( EMCDDA , 2008c ) .
selective prevention intervenes with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scarce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
indicated prevention aims to identify individuals with behavioural or psychological problems that may be predictive for developing problem substance use later in life , and to target them individually with special interventions .
Psychosocial interventions form the foundation of communitybased outpatient and inpatient treatment , and they also normally complement opioid substitution treatment . drug detoxification is a

see Tables HSR @-@ 1 and HSR @-@ 2 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.See Table HSR @-@ 3 in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
the ratio is lower among primary users of non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 2.2 : 1 ) and higher among users of cocaine ( 5.1 : 1 ) and cannabis ( 8 : 1 ) .
national experts estimate that inpatient psychosocial treatment is available to the majority of those seeking it in 12 countries and to almost all who seek it in a further nine countries .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment modality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see Figure 1C ) .
single or irregular treatment outcome evaluations are also reported by some countries .
efficacy is ideally determined by carrying out controlled trials or randomised controlled trials where interventions are compared against specific outcome measures . most of the evidence base in this area comes from studies conducted in the United States .
Studies in Europe are now becoming more common , and include some ground @-@ breaking work on new agents for opioid substitution treatment .
the new module also includes : links to other information sources , evaluated interventions , a glossary and a brief synopsis of the gaps in the current evidence base .
most countries provide a range of health care and social services , including individual risk assessment and advice , safer use training , infectious diseases testing and counselling , vaccination and treatment of viral hepatitis .
all Member States report the availability of housing schemes that can accommodate drug users .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including computerised databases and dedicated communication networks .
controlled deliveries of drugs and targeted operations aimed at disrupting or eliminating drug selling points are some of the operational tactics used by law enforcement agencies in Europe .
performing checks and searches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more generic tactic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .
this involves processing importation and exportation requests as well as identifying and investigating suspicious transactions .

it is estimated that about 12 million Europeans used the drug in the last month , on average about 3.6 % of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds .
drug use in the general or school population can be measured through representative surveys , which provide estimates of the proportion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time .

the EMCDDA , in close collaboration with national experts , has developed a set of core items for use in adult surveys ( the " European Model Questionnaire , " EMQ ) .
in this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available in each country , which in most cases is between 2004 and 2007 .
the mean retail price of herbal cannabis ranged between EUR 1 and EUR 12 per gram in the 17 countries supplying information , with about half of them reporting prices of between EUR 4 and EUR 9 .

as with adults , increases in cannabis use among school students occurred in a number of European countries between 1995 and 2003 , but in general have come to a halt or decreased more recently .
different methodologies to estimate , within the general population surveys , the prevalence of intensive and problematic forms of drug use , mainly cannabis use , have been tested in recent years .
it was estimated that : nearly all those seeking specific treatment would obtain it in France , Greece and Slovenia ; more than half of them in Germany and the United Kingdom ; and only a minority in the remaining eight countries .

in countries where amphetamines dominate the market in illicit stimulant drugs , estimates of cocaine use are low in nearly all cases . Conversely , in most countries where cocaine is the main illicit stimulant , low levels of amphetamine use are reported .
the European average for last year use of cocaine among this age group is estimated at 2.2 % ( 3 million ) and for last month use at 0.8 % ( 1 million ) .
overall , cocaine remains the second most used illicit drug in Europe , after cannabis , though levels of use vary greatly between countries .

chapter 5 : cocaine and crack cocaine especially among clients with a primary heroin problem
crack cocaine use in Europe
the first group typically reports snorting the drug , and sometimes consuming it in conjunction with other substances such as alcohol or cannabis , but not with opioids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
for this reason , in Ireland outreach work and other interventions are recommended in order to attract into treatment users who would otherwise not be reached ( Connolly et al . , 2008 ) .
for example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where opioid users are the main clientele . measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
according to a recent Cochrane review , this combination has yielded the best results for the treatment of stimulant dependence ( Knapp et al . , 2007 ) .
in addition , 11 Member States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or crack cocaine users .
programmes offer advice and information to young people on the risks associated with alcohol and drug use in general , usually including material on the risks of cocaine use .
the most recent estimate of global potential heroin production is 735 tonnes in 2007 ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
among these countries , the reported wholesale price of heroin ranges from EUR 12.5 to EUR 35.8 per gram , and the mean retail price , where available , ranges from EUR 36 to EUR 62.7 .
at both wholesale and retail levels of the market , the lowest prices are reported for Romania and the highest for Spain .
nonetheless , analysis in this area can be informative , especially in respect to trends over time as it can point to important changes taking place in the market .
overall , of the around 325 000 treatment entries for which the primary drug is known , 49 % cited heroin as their primary drug ; if other opioids are included , time ( 112 ) .
this is perhaps most clearly visible since 2003 among seizures and druginduced deaths , and after 2004 in new treatment demands related to heroin use .
injecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @-@ borne infections ( e.g. HIV / AIDS , hepatitis ) or druginduced deaths .
in Cyprus , an estimate made in 2007 indicates that there has been a significant increase in problem opioid use , which has been linked with an increase in foreign nationals in treatment ( 114 ) . information from the
injecting drug use is one of the main determinants of serious public health problems among drug users , including HIV / AIDS , hepatitis C and overdose .
treatment reports also suggest that among opioid users , the popularity of injecting may vary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the proportion of injectors among new opioid clients ranges from 0.9 % to 47.2 % .
the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the prevalence of injecting drug use .
the proportion of injectors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . this trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e.g. Czech Republic , Germany ) .
between 2002 and 2007 , the proportion of injectors among primary opioid clients entering treatment has decreased in most countries , with statistically significant declines reported in 13 countries .
in France , for example , a decrease in the prevalence of injecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initiation of heroin use has become increasingly
national experts report that specific programmes exist in 18 countries , but in 14 of these they are available only to a minority of clients in need .
in seven other countries , there are no dedicated programmes at all , but five of them plan to develop such programmes in the next 3 years .
its findings highlight the difficulties of comparative analyses in this area , underlining the need for a more harmonised approach for diagnosis , treatment and study of co @-@ morbidity in Europe ( Baldacchino et al . , 2009 ) .
at the same time , care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substances is not compromised ( Cherny et al . , 2006 ) .
female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .
high levels of psychiatric disorders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a concomitant psychiatric morbidity were primary opioid users ( 125 ) .
almost all opioid users entering treatment report initiation before the age of 30 and about half before the age of 20 .
drug @-@ free and substitution treatment for opioid use are available in all EU Member States , Croatia and Norway . in Turkey , the future use of substitution treatment is currently under study .
NB : the percentage of substitution treatment clients receiving their treatment from general practitioners in the Community is indicated on the map.Sources : Reitox national focal points .
drug @-@ free treatment is a therapeutic approach , which generally requires individuals to abstain from all substances , including substitution medication .
in Greece for example , the waiting time for opioid substitution treatment is on average more than 3 years .
in four countries ( Estonia , Luxembourg , Hungary , Netherlands ) , it is estimated to be provided only to a minority of clients in substitution treatment .
according to expert estimates , the availability of opioid substitution treatment is relatively high in 16 countries , where it is available to at least half of opioid users ( see Chapter 2 ) .
29 % and 60 % , while in Italy , different regional estimates range from around 36 % to 92 % .
the most complete data set available is that for the antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen ( antiHBc ) , which indicates a history of infection .
for 2006 @-@ 07 , three of the 10 countries providing data on injecting drug users report anti @-@ HBc prevalence levels of over 40 % ( 137 ) .
access to sterile injecting equipment through needle and syringe programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries , testing and counselling for infectious diseases by 16 countries and the dissemination of information , education and communication material by 14 countries .
to reduce the burden of hepatitis C in Europe , it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group - chronic carriers of the virus who are active drug injectors .
current treatments for chronic hepatitis C - a 6 to 12 months course of combination therapy with longacting interferon and ribavirin - are effective with more than 50 % of patients achieving a sustained virological response .
the number of syringes provided through needle and syringe programmes increased between 2005 and 2007 in 18 of the 26 countries for which data are available .
a national survey conducted in the 120 French " CAARUD " harmreduction centres showed that they had been used by an estimated 40 000 individuals in 2007 ( Toufik et al . , 2008 ) .
population mortality rates due to druginduced death vary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @-@ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( Figure 13 ) .
this suggests that the total mortality in this population could be around two to five times the number of registered druginduced deaths .
this type of study can determine overall and cause @-@ specific mortality rates for the cohort , and can estimate the group 's excess mortality compared to the general population .
both methods have been successfully pilot @-@ tested in the Czech Republic , and the EMCDDA plans to set up a group of interested countries that could use this work in the near future .
deaths indirectly related to drug use
other diseases that also account for a proportion of deaths among drug users include chronic conditions such as liver diseases ( due to hepatitis C infection and heavy alcohol use ) , cancer and cardiovascular problems .
other causes have received much less attention , despite indications that they have a considerable impact .
) The year 2006 was taken as the more recent year for which information from almost all Member States regarding causes of death is available through Eurostat .
for detailed information on sources , for the transmission groups , numbers and computations see Table DRD @-@ 5 ( part III ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin . )
in recent cohort studies in Europe , suicide accounted for 6 % to 11 % of deaths among problem drug users . however , the overall impact of these causes is difficult to assess due to the limited availability of data .
drug users are informed about overdose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abstinence , the effects and risks of polydrug use , in particular concomitant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
in England , it has been estimated that 15 % of the 1 506 drug overdose deaths in 2005 occurred in people recently released from prison ( Department of Health , 2007 ) .

cocaine use in Europe : implications for service delivery
it produces euphoria and appetite suppression , and has multiple negative effects on health ( see " Health issues " ) .

cocaine use has been shown to have negative effects on health , especially among frequent users .
different groups of users
drug addiction is a behaviour characterised by the individual exhibiting a loss of control over their consumption . addicts may wish to stop , but find it difficult to do so , despite often experiencing negative consequences .
spurred on by recent technological developments occurring rapidly in this field , newmodels have arisen which take into account the implication of other neurotransmitters in the process , also exploring the role of genetic differences between individuals .

they also show that many drivers are unaware of the effects of combining drugs and alcohol .
natural capital and ecosystem services
environment , health and quality of life
however , major environmental challenges remain which will have significant consequences for Europe if left unaddressed .
environment , health and quality of life - Water and air pollution have declined but not enough to achieve good ecological quality in all water bodies or to ensure good air quality in all urban areas .
these interdependencies and trends , many of them outside Europe 's direct influence , will have significant consequences and potential risks for the resilience and sustainable development of Europe 's economy and society .
increased resource efficiency and security can be achieved , for example , using extended life cycle approaches to reflect the full environmental impacts of products and activities .
Clustering sectoral policies according to their resource needs and environmental pressures would improve coherence , address shared challenges efficiently , maximise economic and social benefits and help avoid unintended consequences .

however , by 2003 the sites designated by

this largely reflects the pan @-@ European production and consumption PA � erns that are accompanying the expansion of the EU internal market .
prices are an important factor for steering demand in a market economy , and in the case of transport both the level and the structure of user prices are relevant .
the reasons are complex but largely linked to socio @-@ economic factors such as the expansion of the EU internal market , which is driving the rise in freight transport .

the average temperature in Europe has increased by 0.95 ° C over the past 100 years and is projected to rise by as much as a further 6.3 ° C by 2100 .
however , projections indicate that this positive development may in some areas be counteracted by an increased risk of water shortage , which would harm vegetation .
the Kyoto Protocol has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrialised countries to 5 % below 1990 levels by the period 2008 @-@ 2012 .

it should raise our awareness and encourage us to develop new , more sustainable patterns of living , growing , producing and consuming . ultimately , we are talking about revaluing the fundamental elements of life .
this ten fold increase has several key drivers , not least the movement of raw materials and goods - which come from our environment .
in contrast to this economic growth , our environment has suffered .
it was here that the global effort to tackle climate change began in earnest . the summit resulted in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) which forms the legal basis for global efforts to address climate change .
this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Cop 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases .
the Kyoto Protocol , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNFCCC , is a first step in the long @-@ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @-@ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the Kyoto ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
immediately after the hand @-@ over of the ' inventory ' report , the EEA 's climate change team begins its second major reporting exercise of the year culminating in the ' Trends and projections ' report .
consider the energy sector , which is responsible for more than 80 % of the total greenhouse gases emissions in the EU .
next December , a major task of the Cop 15 will be to finally turn the rhetoric into a global emissions reduction effort .
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
governments at local and national level , desperate to boost water supply , are investing in projects such as reservoirs for storing water , water transfer and desalination plants , which make salt water fit for drinking .

at the same time , agriculture and tourism will require more water especially in the hotter drier regions.An increase in water temperatures and lower river flows in the south will also affect water quality .
at a cost of GBP 200m , more than EUR 250m , the facility could supply 140 million litres of water a day , enough to supply 400 000 homes .

motherhood and a recent asthma attack have quite rightly brought air pollution back to mind .
the air she and Johan breathe is much improved compared to the past , and air policy is one of the great success stories of the EU 's environmental efforts .

in the context of the discussions on the future of the policy , the EEA is also preparing an analysis of the CAP focusing on ' targeting ' of the subsidy 's ' environmental ' spending .
in the EU @-@ 15 , farming causes almost half of the nitrogen pollution in rivers , 94 % of ammonia emissions and 9 % of total greenhouse gas emissions .
the Common Agriculture Policy ( CAP ) has undergone a series of fundamental reforms since its birth in an era of post @-@ war food shortages .
the subsidy has increasingly been decoupled from its original goal of increasing food
information within countries is much less detailed .
as a result the EEA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
the single farm payments , under Pillar I , are still very much targeted at farms with a high productivity because current support payments are linked to the historic distribution of subsidies .
hydrogen sulphide is toxic to most life forms , and it was probably a combination of hydrogen sulphide and lack of oxygen that killed the Norway lobsters in the Kattegat that night back in 1986 .
the Baltic was actually a freshwater lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago , allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake .
salinity in the Baltic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Baltic Sea .
illegal fishing adds to the problem .
of the three major fished species , cod , herring , and sprat , cod is particularly sensitive to reduced salinity because salinity affects both their reproductive capacity and the availability of the preferred food for cod larvae .
as a result , despite its depth , it remains well oxygenated , even during autumn .

in this context , the EEA has been looking at how the impending bioenergy boom might develop , and considering whether it can provide the energy we need without damaging the environment .
the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from renewables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , etc. as well as bioenergy ) by 2020 .
this process harnesses the heat that is a by @-@ product of energy production .
however , a clear message still emerges from the exercise : it would be better , in terms of costs and climate mitigation , to prioritise bioenergy for electricity and heat generation using CHP plants rather than focus on fuel for transport .
Europe has a body of legislation in place regarding the shipment of hazardous and problematic waste .
however , further evidence is required as to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of easing pressure on the environment.Electronic waste , which is considered hazardous , is an important case .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' hazardous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .

driving forces behind recycling regions is expected to be significantly higher .
the data do not facilitate an analysis of whether the shipped waste receives better treatment at its destination , so we don 't know whether it is bad for the environment .
