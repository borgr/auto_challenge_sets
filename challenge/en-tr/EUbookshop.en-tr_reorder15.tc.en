it is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person ( see the reference to the " elevator pitch " in Chapter 6 ) .

the 2007 ESPAD report substance use among students in 35 countries
country sample sizes were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
in all ESPAD countries at least two thirds of the students have drunk alcohol at least once during their lifetime , with an ESPAD average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited comparability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited comparability ) , the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom .
lifetime use of magic mushrooms was reported by 3 % while GHB and steroids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same magnitude as reported experience of intravenous drug use .
in the two top @-@ prevalence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Isle of Man ) one in six students reported cannabis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular cannabis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @-@ 2 % in Armenia , the Faroe Islands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @-@ prevalence countries are most often found in western Europe .
countries where many students report past 30 days cannabis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try cannabis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illicit drugs at least once during their lifetime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @-@ year cannabis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing cannabis @-@ related problems , and the average prevalence of high @-@ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from cannabis were found , and the percentage of high @-@ risk users in a population corresponds to the cannabis use prevalence rates in the single countries .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @-@ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall upward trend when the period is considered all in all .
since there is a high co @-@ variation between illicit drug use and cannabis use on the country level , quite naturally the development for lifetime cannabis use is more or less the same as described for all illicit drugs above .
the overall substance @-@ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the variable in focus .
a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illicit drug use is rising .

in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annulment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint directive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutors @-@ General dealt with cannabis @-@ related infringements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offenders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guideline on cannabis , " according to which possession of up to 10 grams of cannabis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
the aforementioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sentencing of over 1 800 cases in six different Länder ( Schäfer and Paoli , 2006 ) .
in Romania , court sentencing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social reintegration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the sanction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed compulsory treatment , effectively decreasing the involvement of the probation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical guidance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @-@ based prevention ( e.g. in France and Ireland ) .
in this regard , it is helpful that the concept of selective prevention does not focus on drug use and does not stigmatise drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulnerability in a broader sense .
several Member States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe of the epidemiological situation that has been achieved by the EMCDDA @-@ driven development and implementation of indicator @-@ based monitoring , standardised reporting on responses is limited .

in the new central European Member States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @-@ injectors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent infectious disease .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing infectious disease are clearly geared towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for delivering medical and social services .
an initiative in this direction is the joint EMCDDA @-@ correlation project , supported by experts from the national focal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
the service most commonly offered to homeless problem drug users is access to " generic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries combine the two systems .
participation in ESPAD has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU Member States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
the survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illicit drugs , with the standard time frames , and frequency of use .
50 % in the Czech Republic , Spain and France (
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( EMCDDA , 2004a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily cannabis users .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in adolescents seeking treatment for cannabis use who have coexisting mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influencing demand for treatment ( 78
brief interventions are cost @-@ effective and may be particularly appropriate to cannabis users , as they are found to work well with drug users who :

reports about acute or chronic health problems requiring medical interventions relating to the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hallucinogenic substances by young people .
however , the absence of accurate and comparable systems for recording deaths and non @-@ fatal emergencies related to the use of these substances limits the data available in this area .
the decision broadens the scope of , and replaces , the 1997 joint action ( 3 ) , which was devoted exclusively to new synthetic drugs .
assessment and control of new psychoactive substances was published in the Official Journal of the European Union ( OJ L 127 , 20.5.2005 , pp. 32 @-@ 37 ) and took effect on 21 May 2005 .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe better identified by focusing the analysis on groups in which drug use is concentrated , in particular young people living in urban areas .
Netherlands ( 167 ) . the average purity of heroin products has been fluctuating in most reporting countries ( 168 ) since 1999 , making it difficult to identify any overall trend .
for example , in countries with a high proportion of stimulant users ( the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) , the rates of injecting among heroin users might not be representative of the overall situation .
in some EU @-@ 15 Member States from which data are available ( Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom ) , rates of injecting among heroin users in treatment have declined .
41 % of a sample of 964 in 2001 to 54 % of 350 in 2005 ) and exceptionally high in another ( Kohtla @-@ Järve : 90 % out of 100 ) .
in the Nordic region , the great majority of notified acute cases of hepatitis B occur among IDUs , and hepatitis B outbreaks have coincided with increases in drug injecting in several countries .
in Finland , hepatitis B notifications among IDUs have fallen steeply in recent years , possibly as a result of vaccination programmes and a comprehensive needle and syringe exchange system .
the purchase of syringes through pharmacies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some injectors , and the potential to exploit this contact point as a conduit to other services clearly exists .
the EMCDDA figures include a few deaths among those over 65 years , with only seven countries reporting that more than 5 % of cases fall into this age group ( 203 ) .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreases in the numbers of drugrelated deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment availability and harm reduction initiatives , although declines in the prevalence of drug use may also be important .
although interpretations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of drugrelated deaths in some countries , these patterns could be related to the trends in heroin injection ( 209 ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe methadone substitution treatment is not currently considered a major response to reduce overdose deaths .
however , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
these kinds of indirect statistical methods complement population survey work , which , for a range of methodological and practical reasons , is less suitable for estimating the prevalence of drug use that is of low prevalence , stigmatised and largely hidden .
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison settings .
the EMCDDA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
increased prevalence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest prevalence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Worryingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @-@ 6 % in 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds ) .
reductions in cultivation can be achieved quickly but are reversed equally quickly .
there is also some activity in the area of developing indexes designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
however , a study commissioned by the EMCDDA has shown that it is possible to assess Coordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Coordination outcomes ( Kenis , 2006 ) .
the conceptualisation of both instruments has involved interesting methodological developments and has allowed a first insight into the use of overall indexes to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .
proportion of overall expenditure devoted to as a proportion health and social law as a proportion of total public amount ( EUR million )
at the end of 2006 , the European Commission presented its first progress review ( 5 ) on the implementation of the EU drugs action plan ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) .
this assessed the extent to which the activities planned for 2006 were achieved and whether the plan 's objectives for 2006 have been fulfilled .
this is stated to be in the interest of good order , safety , health and security , and would be carried out on samples of urine , oral fluids and / or hair .
the Netherlands , Turkey and Norway , drug law offences related to dealing and trafficking are predominant , with these offences accounting for up to 92 % ( the Czech Republic ) of all drug law offences reported in 2005 .
taking peer @-@ reviewed scientific publications as an indicator of scientific activity , an analysis of such publications during 2005 and 2006 and quoted in the national reports reveals a pattern of thematic research priorities that varies between countries .
EU funding for drug @-@ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @-@ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .
approximately half ( 53 % ) of the outpatient clients are treated for primary opioid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular cannabis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
the philosophy of inpatient facilities and the way they work have changed considerably over the years , in response to changing needs .
further details are available at http : / / eldd.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 5036See Table HSR @-@ 6 in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using cannabis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in cannabis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lifetime prevalence rates in the range 10 @-@ 25 % ( 32
levels of cannabis use in France , Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom prevalence levels in recent years ( 2002 , 2003 and 2005 respectively ) , following a period of steady increases .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s onwards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable insight into trends over time .
there are differences between countries in the frequency of cannabis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily cannabis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
concerns have been raised that it may be inappropriate to treat young cannabis users in general drug services if this leads to clients
in recent school surveys , increases in lifetime prevalence of ecstasy use occurred largely in parallel among both male and female school students , although there is a progressive increase in the gender gap with increasing age .
although small in number , crack cocaine users are likely to be at particularly high risk of experiencing problems and may be difficult to engage in treatment and other services .
detecting trends in both price and purity is hampered by a lack of consistent data , and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries ( 118 ) .
generally , the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance .
for EU countries where estimates of problem opioid use were available for 2005 , the extent of substitution treatment among problem opioid users was calculated ( Figure 10 ) .
figure 10 : number of opioid maintenance treatment clients as a percentage of the estimated number of problem opioid users , 2005 generally high , education levels low , and between 10 % and 18 % are reported to be homeless .
most clients ( 60 % ) report initiation of opioid use before the age of 20 ; first use of opioids after the age of 25 was very uncommon ( 133 ) .
there are , though , no fatal cases that can be directly attributed to BZP . in March 2007 , the EU responded to rising concern over the use of BZP by
mCPP their legislation addressing psychotropic substances .
in Amsterdam , the reported number of non @-@ fatal emergencies due to the use of GHB was 76 in 2005 , exceeding , as in previous years , the medical emergencies attributed to use of
" drug @-@ induced deaths " and " acute drug deaths " ( 155 ) .
in Europe , most opioid deaths are related to heroin , but often other substances are also identified as having possibly played a role , in particular alcohol , benzodiazepines , or other opioids and , in some countries , cocaine .
the Czech Republic , Denmark , Germany , Latvia , Malta , the Netherlands , Austria , Portugal and the United Kingdom .
figure 13 : overall trend in acute drug @-@ related deaths , 1996 @-@ 2005 for all Member States with available data account for a decreasing proportion of overdoses ( 170 ) .
a collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project found that opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their peers of the same age ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) .
suggested to account for this recent increase , among which are polydrug use by opioid users , or a possible increase in the availability of heroin .
a longitudinal study on the effectiveness of treatments for heroin addiction , which will examine the association between retention in treatment and mortality , is currently underway in Italy ( Bargagli et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from opioid drugs are at an elevated risk of an overdose , if they relapse back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .

in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @-@ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) .
this makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflections on how drug policies have performed to date , and what directions should be pursued in the future .
this distinction has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .
drug use prevention : evidence base grows but practice is slow to change up employment is one of the key elements of achieving reintegration in to society , and it has been shown to be of high prognostic value .
an important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care tailored to the needs of a more heterogeneous population of drug users .
the portal , which includes a prevention module , provides an overview of the latest evidence on programme efficacy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interventions .
last month use : around 2 million
Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fifty times higher than that found among the general population .
relatively high levels of initiation also appear to be still occurring in some Member States , as indicated by studies among injecting drug users that show a relatively high proportion of young and new injectors .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
in 2008 , 13 EU Member States have already redrafted or are due to review and redraft their national drugpolicy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policymaking at national level .
in the period 2004 @-@ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @-@ enacted it after 12 years without , and the UnitedKingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal definitions of personal use were widened from a maximum of one dose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 doses .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established
though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
detailed information on research in the drugs field carried out in European countries has been collected by the EMCDDA through its network of Reitox national focal points .
in addition to publications specialising in illicit drugs and addiction , articles on illicit drug use are also published in peer @-@ reviewed journals from a wide array of disciplines and in professional magazines .
for instance , providing information about drug effects alone , a widespread approach in Europe , is not only ineffective but may carry risks of unwanted effects ( Werch and Owen , 2002 ) .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe substitution treatment and needle and syringe exchange programmes ( NSPs ) , which target overdose deaths and the spread of infectious diseases .
in Hungary , where NSPs and outreach work have been increasing , a study among the out @-@ of @-@ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
after methadone , buprenorphine is the second most commonly prescribed opioid substitute , and its use in the treatment of opioid dependence has increased in recent years ( see Chapter 6 ) .
Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of inmates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of inmates have injected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wales in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
however , there is no such entitlement if the offender is expected to be released within three months or is considered unfit or not motivated for treatment .
cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultivated in 172 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
seizures of cannabis resin in Europe exceed herbal seizures both in terms of number and quantity : with twice as many seizures ( 325 000 ) and the amount intercepted ( 713 tonnes ) eight times higher .
the data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 1 , SZR @-@ 2 , SZR @-@ 3 , SZR @-@ 4 , SZR @-@ 5 and SZR @-@ 6 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
in 2006 , the reported THC content of resin samples ranged from 2.3 % to 18.4 % , while that of herbal cannabis ranged from under 1 % to 13 % .
however , there are still differences between countries in the methodology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
group have used cannabis in the last year ( 17 % ) or last month ( 9 % ) , though on average slightly fewer among this age group have tried the drug ( 30 % ) .
in some countries it is virtually unreported , whereas in others around 15 % of those questioned report use during the last 30 days , with sometimes even higher figures found among males .
after tobacco and alcohol , cannabis also continues to be the psychoactive substance most commonly used by school students .
estimating intensive and long @-@ term patterns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .
among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , cannabis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .
client profiles in Denmark , Germany , France and Hungary ( 52 ) . those variations may be explained by differences in prevalence of intensive cannabis use , drug treatment organisation or referral practices .
the data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 11 to SZR @-@ 18 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
Stimulant markets in Europe : the relative prevalence of cocaine or amphetamines in seizures and population surveys , and the proportion of drug users in treatment reporting these substances as primary drugs
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe been reported by Latvia and Denmark , while in Sweden and Finland the percentage of new amphetamine clients declined , possibly suggesting an ageing population ( 67 ) .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of methamphetamine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Griffiths et al . , 2008 ) .
countries with sufficient data on last year prevalence of amphetamine use among the 15 @-@ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .
analysis of the number of laboratories dismantled suggests that most production remains located in these three countries , although it may also occur in other South American countries , before exportation to the main consumer markets in North America and Europe .
the data on European cocaine seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 9 and SZR @-@ 10 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe reporting very low levels of lifetime prevalence among all adults ( 0.4 @-@ 1.2 % ) .
UnitedKingdom ( 87 ) .
similarly , in Italy , in 2006 , there were estimated to be between 3.7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
elsewhere in Europe , cocaine accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of all treatment demands ( 10 countries ) or less than 5 % ( 12 countries ) ( 93 ) .
overall the estimated lifetime prevalence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the USA .
in 2006 , around 8 000 crack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the UnitedKingdom ( 102 ) .
in Italy , a largescale clinical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmaceuticals ( aripiprazole and ropinirole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
for example , the incentive could be vouchers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abstinence . in this scenario , failure to stay drugfree results in the loss of the accumulated gains .
treatment found that primary opioid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
most drug clients entering outpatient treatment for primary opioid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other opioids ( 23 % ) and cannabis ( 18 % ) .
Buprenorphine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
in Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of opioids other than heroin or methadone : mainly buprenorphine , painkillers and other opioids ( 112 ) .
figure 8 : estimates of the prevalence of injecting drug use ( casesper1000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ) an increase in the proportion of polydrug users among heroin clients and arise in the number of clients using opioids other than heroin .
the varying levels of new injectors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initiation as well as increasing injecting incidence among the younger or the older populations .
Opioid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment than other clients ( see Chapter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequency of co @-@ morbid psychiatric disorders is noted .
additionally , a randomised trial of injectable opioids ( RIOTT ) is currently underway in the UnitedKingdom which will assess the effectiveness of injectable diamorphine , injectable methadone and oral methadone .
treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
reviews of randomised controlled trials and observational studies conclude that methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) and buprenorphine maintenance treatment ( BMT ) can both be effective for the management of opioid dependence .
in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnosed infections related to injecting drug use with trends in HIV prevalence among IDUs suggests that the incidence of HIV infection related to injecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .
moreover , many druginduced deaths are , in fact , polydrug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
however , other approaches are being explored whereby data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attributable to drugs in a community ( see " Overall drugrelated mortality , " P . 86 ) .
a recent Norwegian study of a cohort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 189 recorded deaths , overdoses , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
however , in 2007 , the United Kingdom 's Department of Health issued new guidelines on clinical management of drug misuse and dependence , setting out specific actions for the prevention of drugrelated deaths .
to identify current developments in the online drug market , the EMCDDA conducted a snapshot study in early 2008 , which surveyed 25 online shops .
the USA , for example , softened its approach to the provision of sterile injecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @-@ borne infections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @-@ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @-@ term data .
a caveat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the epidemic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems arising from the use of this drug are considerable .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @-@ dimensional perspective is becoming increasingly unhelpful in understanding the developing nature of patterns of substance use in Europe .
in Europe today , polydrug patterns are the norm , and the combined use of different substances is responsible for , or complicates , most of the problems we face .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly devalued if they simply open the door for the use of a substitute , which may be even more damaging .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreases , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and proportion of treatment demands related to opioid drugs .
Worryingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be diffusing into new populations .
the illicit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes , new products and marketing opportunities , as well as demonstrating the ability to adapt quickly to control measures .
changes in the ecstasy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals , and these efforts may also have important
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @-@ based products , in particular herbal mixtures , as well as merchandise containing synthetic compounds .
new substances appearing on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world , to experimental chemicals synthesised in laboratories and untested in humans .
the enforcement of drug prohibition is judged by the study to have caused substantial unintended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e.g. geographical displacement of production and trafficking ) .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial cooperation between Member States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor , with only about half the number of objectives ( 24 ) and fewer actions ( 72 ) .
evaluator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of reflection in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
national drug strategies and action plans
a key priority of the plan is to dissuade young people from beginning to use drugs by reaffirming the prohibition of drug use and informing young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of nongovernmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the preparatory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
most countries could provide data on central government expenditure , and seven also reported expenditure by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
estimating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illicit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .
in contrast , for those countries providing COFOG data for unlabelled
in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exempts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of syringes dispensed .
in 2000 , the United Kingdom introduced a minimum sentence of 7 years " imprisonment for a third conviction of trafficking in class A drugs , and in 2001 Greece
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe research efforts in those priority areas that are underrepresented , in particular drug supply .
European countries referred to more than 350 research projects undertaken or published in 2007 and 2008 in the latest Reitox national reports .
selective prevention intervenes with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scarce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
the ratio is lower among primary users of non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 2.2 : 1 ) and higher among users of cocaine ( 5.1 : 1 ) and cannabis ( 8 : 1 ) .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment modality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see Figure 1C ) .
the new module also includes : links to other information sources , evaluated interventions , a glossary and a brief synopsis of the gaps in the current evidence base .
most countries provide a range of health care and social services , including individual risk assessment and advice , safer use training , infectious diseases testing and counselling , vaccination and treatment of viral hepatitis .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including computerised databases and dedicated communication networks .
performing checks and searches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more generic tactic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .

in the 5 @-@ year period 2002 @-@ 07 , the number of drug law offences involving cannabis increased or remained stable in most reporting countries , resulting in an estimated increase of 23 % in the European Union .
the downward trend in heroin @-@ related offences in the European Union noted in previous reports now appears to have ceased , and an increase of about 7 % has been observed for the period 2002 @-@ 07 .
the use of cannabis in Europe has evolved considerably over the last decade , as has the debate on how to respond appropriately to the widespread use of this drug .
global production of cannabis resin in 2008 is estimated at between 2 200 tonnes and 9 900 tonnes ( UNODC , 2009 ) , with Morocco continuing to be the main producer .
) The data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 1 to SZR @-@ 6 in the 2009 statistical bulletin . )
it is estimated that about 12 million Europeans used the drug in the last month , on average about 3.6 % of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds .
drug use in the general or school population can be measured through representative surveys , which provide estimates of the proportion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time .
in this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available in each country , which in most cases is between 2004 and 2007 .

as with adults , increases in cannabis use among school students occurred in a number of European countries between 1995 and 2003 , but in general have come to a halt or decreased more recently .
different methodologies to estimate , within the general population surveys , the prevalence of intensive and problematic forms of drug use , mainly cannabis use , have been tested in recent years .
it was estimated that : nearly all those seeking specific treatment would obtain it in France , Greece and Slovenia ; more than half of them in Germany and the United Kingdom ; and only a minority in the remaining eight countries .

over the past 5 years , the purity of amphetamine has been stable or falling in most of those 20 countries where sufficient data are available to allow analysis of trends .
of the 11 countries where a comparison of data for 2007 and 2006 was possible , Spain , France and Austria reported increases in the retail price , while the rest reported stable or decreasing prices .
in countries where amphetamines dominate the market in illicit stimulant drugs , estimates of cocaine use are low in nearly all cases . Conversely , in most countries where cocaine is the main illicit stimulant , low levels of amphetamine use are reported .
overall , cocaine remains the second most used illicit drug in Europe , after cannabis , though levels of use vary greatly between countries .
lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students in the ESPAD survey is between 1 % and 2 % in half of the 28 reporting countries .

the first group typically reports snorting the drug , and sometimes consuming it in conjunction with other substances such as alcohol or cannabis , but not with opioids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
for example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where opioid users are the main clientele . measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
according to a recent Cochrane review , this combination has yielded the best results for the treatment of stimulant dependence ( Knapp et al . , 2007 ) .
in addition , 11 Member States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or crack cocaine users .
injecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @-@ borne infections ( e.g. HIV / AIDS , hepatitis ) or druginduced deaths .
in Cyprus , an estimate made in 2007 indicates that there has been a significant increase in problem opioid use , which has been linked with an increase in foreign nationals in treatment ( 114 ) . information from the
treatment reports also suggest that among opioid users , the popularity of injecting may vary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the proportion of injectors among new opioid clients ranges from 0.9 % to 47.2 % .
the proportion of injectors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . this trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e.g. Czech Republic , Germany ) .
in France , for example , a decrease in the prevalence of injecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initiation of heroin use has become increasingly
its findings highlight the difficulties of comparative analyses in this area , underlining the need for a more harmonised approach for diagnosis , treatment and study of co @-@ morbidity in Europe ( Baldacchino et al . , 2009 ) .
at the same time , care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substances is not compromised ( Cherny et al . , 2006 ) .
female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .
high levels of psychiatric disorders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a concomitant psychiatric morbidity were primary opioid users ( 125 ) .
drug @-@ free treatment is a therapeutic approach , which generally requires individuals to abstain from all substances , including substitution medication .
for 2006 @-@ 07 , three of the 10 countries providing data on injecting drug users report anti @-@ HBc prevalence levels of over 40 % ( 137 ) .
access to sterile injecting equipment through needle and syringe programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries , testing and counselling for infectious diseases by 16 countries and the dissemination of information , education and communication material by 14 countries .
to reduce the burden of hepatitis C in Europe , it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group - chronic carriers of the virus who are active drug injectors .
current treatments for chronic hepatitis C - a 6 to 12 months course of combination therapy with longacting interferon and ribavirin - are effective with more than 50 % of patients achieving a sustained virological response .
population mortality rates due to druginduced death vary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @-@ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( Figure 13 ) .
both methods have been successfully pilot @-@ tested in the Czech Republic , and the EMCDDA plans to set up a group of interested countries that could use this work in the near future .
deaths indirectly related to drug use
) The year 2006 was taken as the more recent year for which information from almost all Member States regarding causes of death is available through Eurostat .

in recent cohort studies in Europe , suicide accounted for 6 % to 11 % of deaths among problem drug users . however , the overall impact of these causes is difficult to assess due to the limited availability of data .
drug users are informed about overdose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abstinence , the effects and risks of polydrug use , in particular concomitant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
in England , it has been estimated that 15 % of the 1 506 drug overdose deaths in 2005 occurred in people recently released from prison ( Department of Health , 2007 ) .

while the pharmacology of most illicit drugs is well known , the specific mechanisms through which they promote violent behaviours are not fully understood although some substances , usually stimulants , are known to produce
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the proportion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .
drug addiction is a behaviour characterised by the individual exhibiting a loss of control over their consumption . addicts may wish to stop , but find it difficult to do so , despite often experiencing negative consequences .
spurred on by recent technological developments occurring rapidly in this field , newmodels have arisen which take into account the implication of other neurotransmitters in the process , also exploring the role of genetic differences between individuals .
progress in neurobiological research on addiction has led to the use of drugs which target the dopaminergic system . however , this strategy has not yet proven effective in

DRUID aims to provide a solid basis for harmonised , EU @-@ wide regulations for driving under the influence of alcohol , drugs and medicine .
in contrast , laws in the Czech Republic , Estonia , Poland , Slovenia and Slovakia penalise driving with any trace of a substance , even if medicinal .
environment , health and quality of life
environment , health and quality of life - Water and air pollution have declined but not enough to achieve good ecological quality in all water bodies or to ensure good air quality in all urban areas .
increased resource efficiency and security can be achieved , for example , using extended life cycle approaches to reflect the full environmental impacts of products and activities .
Clustering sectoral policies according to their resource needs and environmental pressures would improve coherence , address shared challenges efficiently , maximise economic and social benefits and help avoid unintended consequences .
a further requirement is that the EEA publishes
integrate ecosystem services linked to climate change , resource use and health ; account for use of natural capital ( i.e. water , land , biodiversity , soil ) in decisions on sectoral management .
meeting the target of limiting global temperatures increases to less than 2 ° C will require a concerted global effort - including further substantial GHG emission reductions in Europe .

a challenge for both policy and science is how best to measure environmental impacts that result from resource use ; several current initiatives aim to better quantify the environmental impacts of resource use .
the issues of water quantity and quality , irrigation water demand , water @-@ use conflicts , environmental and socioeconomic aspects and risk management aspects can be better integrated in the institutional and political systems .
eating and drinking , mobility , and to a lesser extent housing , are also the areas of household consumption with the highest pressure intensities , which indicates the largest environmental pressures per Euro spent .

we sincerely hope that this joint report will spur the policy debate and encourage countries and institutions to elaborate and refine the high nature value farmland concept , and further focus their conservation efforts .
the target is to cover ' a substantial proportion ' of such areas with rural development and agrienvironment measures by 2008 . a high nature value farmland indicator is currently under preparation within the framework of IRENA1 .
loss of seminatural vegetations is a consequence of the above agricultural trends . although many case studies exist ( see for example Veen and Seffer , 1999 ) , no reliable panEuropean trend data are currently available for plant communities and habitats .

overall , therefore , the projections show that better management of municipal waste will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe , decoupling environmental pressures from economic growth as called for in the Sixth Environment Action Programme .
it should raise our awareness and encourage us to develop new , more sustainable patterns of living , growing , producing and consuming . ultimately , we are talking about revaluing the fundamental elements of life .
this ten fold increase has several key drivers , not least the movement of raw materials and goods - which come from our environment .
it was here that the global effort to tackle climate change began in earnest . the summit resulted in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) which forms the legal basis for global efforts to address climate change .
this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Cop 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases .
the Kyoto Protocol , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNFCCC , is a first step in the long @-@ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @-@ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the Kyoto ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
governments at local and national level , desperate to boost water supply , are investing in projects such as reservoirs for storing water , water transfer and desalination plants , which make salt water fit for drinking .

the subsidy has increasingly been decoupled from its original goal of increasing food
as a result the EEA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
the single farm payments , under Pillar I , are still very much targeted at farms with a high productivity because current support payments are linked to the historic distribution of subsidies .
