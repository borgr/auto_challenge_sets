Kar@@ l Mar@@ x ( ; ; 5 May 18@@ 18 - 14 March 18@@ 83 ) was a German phil@@ os@@ opher , economist , sociologist , journalist , and revol@@ utionary socialist .
he moved to Paris in 18@@ 43 , where he began writing for other radical newspapers and met Fri@@ ed@@ rich Engel@@ s , who would become his lif@@ el@@ ong friend and collabor@@ ator .
in 18@@ 49 he was ex@@ iled and moved to London together with his wife and children , where he continued writing and formu@@ la@@ ting his the@@ ories about social and economic activity .
in 18@@ 15 Hein@@ rich Mar@@ x began work as an attorney , in 18@@ 19 moving his family to a ten @@@ -@@ @ room property near the P@@ orta N@@ ig@@ ra .
she was from a prosperous business family that later founded the company Philip@@ s Electron@@ ics : she was great @@@ -@@ @ a@@ un@@ t to Anton and Ger@@ ard Philip@@ s , and great @@@ -@@ @ great @@@ -@@ @ a@@ un@@ t to Fr@@ its Philip@@ s .
the third of nine children , he became the oldest son when his brother Mor@@ itz died in 18@@ 19 .
young Kar@@ l was b@@ ap@@ ti@@ sed into the Lu@@ ther@@ an Church in August 18@@ 24 .
his survi@@ ving si@@ b@@ lings , Sop@@ hi@@ e , Her@@ mann , Hen@@ ri@@ ette , Lou@@ ise , Emil@@ ie and Kar@@ oline , were also b@@ ap@@ ti@@ sed as Lu@@ ther@@ ans .
by emplo@@ ying many liberal Human@@ ists as teachers , W@@ y@@ t@@ ten@@ b@@ ach inc@@ urred the an@@ ger of the local conservative government .
subsequently , police rai@@ ded the school in 18@@ 32 , and discovered that literature es@@ po@@ using political liber@@ alism was being distributed among the students .
in October 18@@ 35 at the age of 17 , Mar@@ x travelled to the University of Bonn w@@ ishing to study philosophy and literature : however , his father insisted on law as a more practical field .
while at the University at Bonn , Mar@@ x joined the Po@@ ets ' Club , a group containing political ra@@ dic@@ als that was being monitored by the police .
Mar@@ x also joined the Tri@@ er T@@ aver@@ n Club drinking society ( " Land@@ sman@@ n@@ sc@@ haf@@ t der Tre@@ ver@@ aner " ) , at one point serving as club co @@@ -@@ @ president .
although his grades in the first term were good , they soon deteriorated , leading his father to force a transfer to the more serious and academic University of Berlin .
= = = He@@ gel@@ ian@@ ism and early activis@@ m : 18@@ 36 @@@ -@@ @ 18@@ 43 = = = S@@ pending summer and autumn 18@@ 36 in Tri@@ er , Mar@@ x became more serious about his studies and his life .
in October 18@@ 36 he arrived in Berlin , mat@@ ri@@ c@@ ulating in the university 's faculty of law and r@@ enting a room in the Mit@@ tel@@ str@@ as@@ se .
Mar@@ x became interested in the recently dec@@ eased German phil@@ os@@ opher G@@ . W. F@@ . He@@ gel , whose ideas were then widely debated among European phil@@ osoph@@ ical circles .
Mar@@ x had been emo@@ tionally close to his father , and treas@@ ured his memory after his death .
he began co @@@ -@@ @ operating with Bruno B@@ au@@ er on edi@@ ting He@@ gel 's " Phil@@ osophy of Reli@@ gi@@ on " in 18@@ 40 .
Mar@@ x decided , instead , to submit his th@@ es@@ is to the more liberal University of J@@ ena , whose faculty awarded him his Ph@@ D in April 18@@ 41 .
in July , Mar@@ x and B@@ au@@ er took a trip to Bonn from Berlin .
there they scand@@ alised their class by getting dr@@ un@@ k , la@@ ug@@ hing in church , and gal@@ lop@@ ing through the streets on don@@ ke@@ ys .
Mar@@ x was considering an academic career , but this path was bar@@ red by the government 's growing opposition to classical liber@@ alism and the Young He@@ gel@@ ians .
he criticised both right @@@ -@@ @ wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements whom he thought in@@ effective or counter @@@ -@@ @ productive .
seven years after their engagement , on 19 June 18@@ 43 Mar@@ x married J@@ en@@ ny in a Pro@@ testan@@ t church in Kre@@ uz@@ n@@ ach .
based in Paris , France , it was here that Mar@@ x and his wife moved in October 18@@ 43 .
initially living with Rug@@ e and his wife commun@@ ally at 23 R@@ ue Van@@ e@@ au , they found the living conditions difficult , so moved out following the birth of their daughter J@@ en@@ ny in 18@@ 44 .
based in Paris , the paper was connected to the League of the J@@ ust , a ut@@ op@@ ian socialist secret society of workers and ar@@ tis@@ ans .
on 28 August 18@@ 44 , Mar@@ x met the German socialist Fri@@ ed@@ rich Engel@@ s at the Caf@@ é de la R@@ é@@ gence , beginning a lif@@ el@@ ong friendship .
soon Mar@@ x and Engel@@ s were collabor@@ ating on a criticism of the phil@@ osoph@@ ical ideas of Mar@@ x 's former friend , Bruno B@@ au@@ er .
although critical of B@@ au@@ er , Mar@@ x was increasingly influenced by the ideas of the Young He@@ gel@@ ians Ma@@ x S@@ tir@@ ner and Lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g Fe@@ u@@ er@@ b@@ ach , but eventually Mar@@ x and Engel@@ s abandoned Fe@@ u@@ er@@ b@@ achi@@ an materi@@ alism as well .
during the time that he lived at 38 R@@ ue Van@@ ne@@ au in Paris ( from October 18@@ 43 until January 18@@ 45 ) , Mar@@ x engaged in an intensive study of " political economy " ( A@@ dam S@@ mit@@ h , David Ric@@ ar@@ do , James mill " et@@ c .
" ) , the French soci@@ alists ( especially Claude Hen@@ ri St. Simon and Charles Fo@@ ur@@ ier ) and the history of France .
Mar@@ x sought " to understand the in@@ ner work@@ ings of capitalism .
= = = Brussels : 18@@ 45 @@@ -@@ @ 18@@ 47 = = = unable either to stay in France or to move to Germany , Mar@@ x decided to emig@@ rate to Brussels in Belgium in February 18@@ 45 .
this was Mar@@ x 's first trip to England and Engel@@ s was an ideal guide for the trip .
Engel@@ s had already spent two years living in Man@@ ches@@ ter , from November 18@@ 42 to August 18@@ 44 .
indeed , Engel@@ s was serving as a reporter for many Char@@ tist and socialist English newspapers .
Mar@@ x used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Man@@ ches@@ ter .
in this work , Mar@@ x broke with Fe@@ u@@ er@@ b@@ ach , Bruno B@@ au@@ er , Ma@@ x S@@ tir@@ ner and the rest of the Young He@@ gel@@ ians , and also broke with Kar@@ l Gru@@ n and other " true soci@@ alists " whose phil@@ os@@ op@@ hi@@ es were still based in part on " ide@@ alism .
this work was intended to draw a distinc@@ tion between the ut@@ op@@ ian soci@@ alists and Mar@@ x 's own scientific socialist philosophy .
this was the intent of the new book that Mar@@ x was planning .
this new open political society was called the Communist League .
both Mar@@ x and Engel@@ s participated in drawing the programme and organis@@ ational principles of the new Communist League .
in late 18@@ 47 , Mar@@ x and Engel@@ s began writing what was to become their most famous work - a programme of action for the Communist League .
written jointly by Mar@@ x and Engel@@ s from December 18@@ 47 to January 18@@ 48 , " The Communist manif@@ es@@ to " was first published on 21 February 18@@ 48 .
" the Communist manif@@ es@@ to " laid out the beli@@ efs of the new Communist League .
later that year , Europe experienced a series of protests , rebel@@ li@@ ons , and often violent up@@ heav@@ als that became known as the Revol@@ ution of 18@@ 48 .
on 1 June , Mar@@ x started publication of a daily newspaper , the " Ne@@ ue R@@ he@@ in@@ is@@ che Ze@@ it@@ ung , " which he helped to finance through his recent inher@@ it@@ ance from his father .
consequently , the " Ne@@ ue R@@ he@@ in@@ is@@ che Ze@@ it@@ ung " was soon sup@@ pressed and Mar@@ x was ordered to leave the country on 16 May .
the headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London .
however , in the winter of 18@@ 49 @@@ -@@ @ 18@@ 50 , a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by August Wil@@ li@@ ch and Kar@@ l S@@ chap@@ per began ag@@ it@@ ating for an immediate uprising .
such an uprising , as that recommended by the S@@ chap@@ per / Wil@@ li@@ ch group would easily be cr@@ us@@ hed by the police and the armed forces of the reac@@ tionary governments of Europe .
" instead , they are brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development .
in other words , the working class must join with bour@@ geo@@ is and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bour@@ geo@@ is revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution .
after a long struggle which threatened to ru@@ in the Communist League , Mar@@ x 's opinion prev@@ ailed and , eventually , the Wil@@ li@@ ch / S@@ chap@@ per group left the Communist League .
meanwhile , Mar@@ x also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers ' Educ@@ ational Society .
for the first few years he and his family lived in extreme poverty .
later Mar@@ x and Engel@@ s both began writing for six different newspapers around the world , in England , the United States , Pr@@ us@@ sia , Austria and South Africa .
thus , Mar@@ x sought to communicate with the public by writing articles for the " New York Tribune " and other bour@@ geo@@ is newspapers .
at first Wil@@ helm Pi@@ ep@@ er translated Mar@@ x 's articles from German into English .
the " New York Daily Tribune " had been founded in New York City in the United States of America by Hor@@ ace Gre@@ ele@@ y in April 18@@ 41 .
several things about the " Tribune " made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Mar@@ x to reach a symp@@ a@@ thetic public across the Atlantic Oc@@ ean .
Mar@@ x 's first article for the " New York Tribune " was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the " Tribune " on 21 August 18@@ 52 .
Mar@@ x was just one of the reporters in Europe that the " New York Tribune " employed .
however , with the sla@@ very crisis coming to a head in the late 18@@ 5@@ 0s and with the outbreak of the American Civil War in 18@@ 61 , the American public 's interest in European affairs declined .
thus Mar@@ x very early began to write on issues affecting the United States - particularly the " sla@@ very crisis " and the " War Bet@@ ween the States .
however , the departure of Charles D@@ ana from the paper in late 18@@ 61 and the resul@@ tant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy .
the years of revolution from 18@@ 48 to 18@@ 49 had been a grand experience for both Mar@@ x and Engel@@ s .
they both became sure that their economic view of the course of history was the only valid way that historic events like the revol@@ utionary up@@ sur@@ ge of 18@@ 48 could be adequately explained .
as time passed , they began to think that a new revol@@ utionary up@@ sur@@ ge would not occur until there was another economic downturn .
the question of whether a recession would be necessary to create a new revol@@ utionary situation in society became a point of contention between Mar@@ x and certain other revol@@ u@@ tion@@ aries .
the downturn in the United States economy in 18@@ 52 led Mar@@ x and Engel@@ s to wonder if a revol@@ utionary up@@ sur@@ ge would soon occur .
he also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capit@@ alist economy .
this abri@@ d@@ ged edition was translated into English and published in 19@@ 51 in London .
however , in the same letter to Ver@@ a Z@@ as@@ ul@@ ich , Mar@@ x points out that " at the core of the capit@@ alist system ... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production .
before he died , Mar@@ x asked Engel@@ s to write up these ideas , which were published in 18@@ 84 under the title " The Ori@@ gin of the Family , Priv@@ ate Property and the State . "
there are allegations that Mar@@ x also fa@@ ther@@ ed a son , F@@ red@@ dy , out of w@@ ed@@ lock by his hous@@ eke@@ ep@@ er , H@@ elen@@ e Dem@@ ut@@ h .
Mar@@ x frequently used p@@ se@@ u@@ don@@ y@@ ms , often when r@@ enting a house or flat , apparently to make it harder for the authorities to track him down .
Engel@@ s ' speech included the passage : Mar@@ x 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters Ele@@ an@@ or and Laura , as well as Charles Lon@@ gu@@ et and Paul L@@ af@@ argue , Mar@@ x 's two French socialist sons @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , were also in attendance .
Li@@ eb@@ k@@ nec@@ ht , a founder and leader of the German Social @@@ -@@ @ Democratic Party , gave a speech in German , and Lon@@ gu@@ et , a prominent figure in the French working @@@ -@@ @ class movement , made a short statement in French .
two tele@@ gram@@ s from workers ' parties in France and Spain were also read out .

when a plant has two cop@@ ies of this white alle@@ le , its flowers are white - regardless of whether the first gen@@ e has blue or mag@@ enta alle@@ les .
these complex tra@@ its are products of many gen@@ es .
the influence of these gen@@ es is mediated , to var@@ ying degrees , by the environment an organ@@ ism has experienced .

DNA is composed of a chain of n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des , of which there are four types : ad@@ en@@ ine ( A ) , cy@@ tos@@ ine ( C ) , gu@@ an@@ ine ( G ) , and th@@ y@@ mine ( T ) .
vir@@ uses are the only exception to this rule - sometimes vir@@ uses use the very similar mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e R@@ NA instead of DNA as their gen@@ etic material .
DNA norm@@ ally exists as a double @@@ -@@ @ st@@ ran@@ ded mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e , co@@ iled into the shape of a double hel@@ i@@ x .
these DNA str@@ ands are often extremely long ; the largest human ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome , for example , is about 2@@ 47 million base p@@ airs in length .
the full set of her@@ edi@@ tary material in an organ@@ ism ( usually the combined DNA sequ@@ ences of all ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes ) is called the gen@@ ome .
some bac@@ ter@@ ia can undergo con@@ j@@ ug@@ ation , transferring a small cir@@ cular piece of DNA to another bac@@ ter@@ ium .
for gen@@ es that are closer together , however , the lower prob@@ ability of cross@@ over means that the gen@@ es demonstrate gen@@ etic lin@@ k@@ age ; alle@@ les for the two gen@@ es tend to be inherited together .
prote@@ ins are made up of one or more pol@@ y@@ pe@@ p@@ ti@@ de cha@@ ins , each of which is composed of a sequ@@ ence of am@@ ino ac@@ ids , and the DNA sequ@@ ence of a gen@@ e ( through an R@@ NA inter@@ mediate ) is used to produce a specific am@@ ino ac@@ id sequ@@ ence .
this process begins with the production of an R@@ NA mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e with a sequ@@ ence mat@@ ching the gen@@ e 's DNA sequ@@ ence , a process called trans@@ cri@@ ption .
prote@@ ins can bin@@ d to other prote@@ ins and simple mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les , sometimes acting as en@@ z@@ y@@ mes by facilitating chemical reactions within the bound mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les ( without changing the structure of the prote@@ in itself ) .
prote@@ in structure is dynamic ; the prote@@ in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ben@@ ds into slightly different forms as it facilit@@ ates the capture , transport , and release of ox@@ y@@ gen mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les within mam@@ mal@@ ian blood .
a single n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ de difference within DNA can cause a change in the am@@ ino ac@@ id sequ@@ ence of a prote@@ in .
in some cases , these products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions ( e@@ .@@ g@@ .

= = = Gen@@ e regulation = = = The gen@@ ome of a given organ@@ ism contains thousands of gen@@ es , but not all these gen@@ es need to be active at any given moment .
the presence of try@@ p@@ top@@ han directly affects the activity of the gen@@ es - try@@ p@@ top@@ han mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les bin@@ d to the try@@ p@@ top@@ han re@@ pres@@ sor ( a trans@@ cri@@ ption factor ) , changing the re@@ pres@@ sor 's structure such that the re@@ pres@@ sor bin@@ ds to the gen@@ es .
differences in gen@@ e expression are especially clear within mul@@ tic@@ el@@ lular organis@@ ms , where cells all contain the same gen@@ ome but have very different structures and behavi@@ ors due to the expression of different sets of gen@@ es .
all the cells in a mul@@ tic@@ el@@ lular organ@@ ism der@@ ive from a single cell , differ@@ enti@@ ating into vari@@ ant cell types in response to external and inter@@ cel@@ lular signals and gradually establishing different pat@@ ter@@ ns of gen@@ e expression to create different behavi@@ ors .
as no single gen@@ e is responsible for the development of structures within mul@@ tic@@ el@@ lular organis@@ ms , these pat@@ ter@@ ns arise from the complex inter@@ actions between many cells .
because of ep@@ ig@@ en@@ etic features , different cell types grown within the same medium can retain very different properties .
these err@@ ors , called mut@@ ations , can have an impact on the ph@@ en@@ oty@@ pe of an organ@@ ism , especially if they occur within the prote@@ in co@@ ding sequ@@ ence of a gen@@ e .

Belgium 's lin@@ gu@@ istic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of government .
many of these fi@@ ef@@ d@@ oms were united in the Bur@@ gun@@ dian Netherlands of the 14th and 15th centuries .
the main political parties of the 19th century were the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party , with the Belgian Labour Party emerging towards the end of the 19th century .
this recognition became official in 18@@ 98 and in 1967 a Dutch version of the Constitution was legally accepted .
Germany inv@@ aded Belgium in 19@@ 14 as part of the Sch@@ li@@ eff@@ en Plan to attack France and much of the Western Fr@@ on@@ t fighting of World War I occurred in western parts of the country .
Belgium took over the German col@@ on@@ ies of Ru@@ anda @@@ -@@ @ U@@ run@@ di ( modern day R@@ w@@ anda and Bur@@ un@@ di ) during the war , and they were man@@ dated to Belgium in 19@@ 24 by the League of N@@ ations .
the Belgian Con@@ go gained independence in 1960 during the Con@@ go Crisis ; Ru@@ anda @@@ -@@ @ U@@ run@@ di followed with its independence two years later .
Belgium joined NATO as a founding member and formed the Ben@@ elu@@ x group of nations with the Netherlands and Luxembourg .
Belgium became one of the six founding members of the European Co@@ al and Steel Community in 19@@ 51 and of the European Atomic Energy Community and European Economic Community , established in 19@@ 57 .
late that century , and continuing into the 20th century , F@@ le@@ mis@@ h movements evol@@ ved to counter this situation .
although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments , when the Commun@@ ities and Regi@@ ons were created in 1980 , F@@ le@@ mis@@ h politicians decided to mer@@ ge both .

p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia pre@@ sumed to be bac@@ ter@@ ial is treated with anti@@ bio@@ tics .
if the p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia is severe , the affected person is generally hosp@@ ital@@ ized .
p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia affects approximately 450 million people g@@ lob@@ ally per year , seven percent of population , and results in about 4 million deaths , mostly in developing countries .
nevertheless , in developing countries , and among the very old , the very young , and the chron@@ ically ill , p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia remains a leading cause of death .
in the elderly , conf@@ usion may be the most prominent sign .
the typical signs and symp@@ t@@ oms in children under five are f@@ ever , c@@ ough , and fast or difficult bre@@ a@@ thing .

res@@ pir@@ atory syn@@ cy@@ tial virus is typically contracted when people touch cont@@ am@@ inated objects and then they touch their eyes or n@@ ose .
some vir@@ uses such as meas@@ les and her@@ pes simp@@ le@@ x may reach the lun@@ gs via the blood .
when the im@@ mun@@ e system respon@@ ds to the infection , even more lun@@ g damage may occur .
as well as damaging the lun@@ gs , many vir@@ uses simultaneously affect other organs and thus dis@@ rupt other body functions .
vir@@ uses also make the body more sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to bac@@ ter@@ ial inf@@ ections ; in this way , bac@@ ter@@ ial p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia can arise as a co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid condition .
half of normal people have these small aspirations during sle@@ ep .
while the thro@@ at always contains bac@@ ter@@ ia , potentially inf@@ ec@@ tious ones resi@@ de there only at certain times and under certain conditions .
bac@@ ter@@ ia can spread also via the blood .
this leads to the f@@ ever , ch@@ il@@ ls , and fatigue common in bac@@ ter@@ ial p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia .
the World Health Organ@@ ization has defined p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia in children clin@@ ically based on either a c@@ ough or difficulty bre@@ a@@ thing and a rapid res@@ pir@@ atory rate , ch@@ est in@@ drawing , or a decreased level of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
thus , treatment is frequently based on the presence of influ@@ en@@ za in the community or a rapid influ@@ en@@ za test .
exam@@ ination of the ch@@ est may be normal , but it may show decreased ch@@ est expansion on the affected side .
in people with mil@@ d disease , im@@ aging is needed only in those with potential complic@@ ations , those not having improved with treatment , or those in which the cause is uncertain .
findings do not always match the sever@@ ity of disease and do not reli@@ ably separate between bac@@ ter@@ ial infection and vir@@ al infection .
X @@@ -@@ @ ray presentations of p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia may be classified as lob@@ ar p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia , bron@@ ch@@ op@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia ( also known as lo@@ bu@@ lar p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia ) , and inter@@ sti@@ tial p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia .

nevertheless it pursu@@ es an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace @@@ -@@ @ building processes around the world .
in addition to being the birth@@ place of the Red Cro@@ ss , Switzerland is home to numerous international organiz@@ ations , including the second largest UN office .
on the European level , it is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association and is part of the Schengen A@@ rea - although it is notably not a member of the European Union , nor the European Economic A@@ rea ( and thus does not use the Euro currency ) .

the ear@@ li@@ est known cultural tri@@ bes of the area were members of the Hal@@ l@@ stat@@ t and La T@@ è@@ ne cultures , named after the archaeological site of La T@@ è@@ ne on the north side of Lake Ne@@ u@@ ch@@ â@@ tel .
one of the most important tri@@ bal groups in the Swiss region was the Hel@@ ve@@ ti@@ i .
by 1@@ 200 , the Swiss pla@@ te@@ au comprised the domin@@ ions of the houses of Sav@@ oy , Z@@ ä@@ h@@ r@@ inger , Hab@@ sburg , and Ky@@ burg .
some regions ( U@@ ri , Schw@@ y@@ z , Un@@ ter@@ wal@@ den , later known as " Wal@@ d@@ st@@ ä@@ t@@ ten " ) were accor@@ ded the Im@@ per@@ ial immedi@@ acy to grant the emp@@ ire direct control over the mountain passes .
in 18@@ 15 the Congress of Vienna fully re @@@ -@@ @ established Swiss independence and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutr@@ ality .
the treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory , with the admission of the cant@@ ons of Val@@ a@@ is , Ne@@ u@@ ch@@ â@@ tel and Geneva .
the war lasted for less than a month , causing fewer than 100 casualties , most of which were through friendly fire .
under General Hen@@ ri Gu@@ is@@ an central command , a general mobil@@ isation of the armed forces was ordered .
over the course of the war , Switzerland inter@@ ned over 300,000 refugees and the International Red Cro@@ ss , based in Geneva , played an important part during the conflict .
strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy , but not until the end of the 20th century .
on 18 April 1999 the Swiss population and the cant@@ ons voted in favour of a completely revised federal constitution .
Switzerland is a founding member of the E@@ FTA , but is not a member of the European Economic A@@ rea .

Google was founded by Lar@@ ry page and Sergey Br@@ in while they were Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . students at Stan@@ ford University .
they called this new technology P@@ age@@ Ran@@ k ; it determined a website 's re@@ lev@@ ance by the number of pages , and the importance of those pages , that linked back to the original site .
a small search engine called " Ran@@ k@@ De@@ x " from I@@ D@@ D Information Services designed by Rob@@ in L@@ i was , since 1996 , already expl@@ oring a similar strategy for site @@@ -@@ @ scoring and page ranking .
the dom@@ ain name for Google was registered on September 15 , 1997 , and the company was incorpor@@ ated on September 4 , 1998 .
it was based in the gar@@ age of a friend ( Sus@@ an W@@ oj@@ c@@ icki ) in Men@@ lo Park , California .
Crai@@ g Sil@@ ver@@ stein , a fellow Ph@@ D student at Stan@@ ford , was hired as the first employee .
the company is listed on the Nas@@ da@@ q stock exchange under the tic@@ ker symbol G@@ O@@ O@@ G and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the tic@@ ker symbol G@@ G@@ Q@@ 1 .
= = = Growth = = = In March 1999 , the company moved its offices to Pal@@ o Al@@ to , California , which is home to several prominent Sil@@ ic@@ on Valley technology start@@ ups .
this model of selling key@@ word advertising was first p@@ ion@@ e@@ ered by G@@ oto@@ .com , an I@@ deal@@ a@@ b sp@@ in @@@ -@@ @ off created by Bill G@@ ross .
in 2001 , Google received a pat@@ ent for its P@@ age@@ Ran@@ k mechanism .
in 2003 , after out@@ growing two other locations , the company le@@ ased an office complex from Sil@@ ic@@ on graph@@ ics at 1@@ 600 A@@ mp@@ hi@@ theatre Par@@ k@@ way in Mountain Vi@@ ew , California .
three years later , Google bought the property from S@@ G@@ I for $ 3@@ 19 million .
the start @@@ -@@ @ up company developed a product called Earth Vi@@ e@@ wer that gave a three @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional view of the Earth .
Google ren@@ amed the service to Google Earth in 2005 .
on August 5 , 2009 , Google bought out its first public company , purchasing video software maker On@@ 2 Technologies for $ 10@@ 6.5 million .
in April 2010 , Google announced it had acquired a hard@@ w@@ are start@@ up , A@@ gn@@ il@@ u@@ x .
in 2005 , Google partner@@ ed with NASA A@@ mes Research Center to build of offices .
Google entered into a partnership with S@@ un Mic@@ ro@@ systems in October 2005 to help share and distri@@ bute each other 's technologies .
Google would later launch " Ad@@ Sen@@ se for Mobile , " taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market .
in 2008 , Google developed a partnership with Geo@@ E@@ ye to launch a satellite providing Google with high @@@ -@@ @ resolution ( 0.@@ 41 m mon@@ o@@ ch@@ rome , 1.@@ 65 m col@@ or ) imag@@ ery for Google Earth .
the satellite was launched from V@@ and@@ en@@ berg Air Force B@@ ase on September 6 , 2008 .
some images in the archi@@ ve were never published in the magazine .
in 2010 , Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project , putting $ 38.@@ 8 million into two wind far@@ ms in North D@@ ak@@ ota .
the company announced the two locations will generate 16@@ 9.@@ 5 megawat@@ ts of power , enough to supply 5@@ 5,000 homes .
the far@@ ms , which were developed by Nex@@ t@@ Er@@ a Energy Res@@ ources , will reduce fos@@ sil fuel use in the region and return profits .
Nex@@ t@@ Er@@ a Energy Res@@ ources sold Google a twenty @@@ -@@ @ percent stake in the project to get funding for its development .
also in 2010 , Google purchased Global IP Sol@@ utions , a Norway @@@ -@@ @ based company that provides web @@@ -@@ @ based tele@@ con@@ fer@@ encing and other related services .
on May 27 , 2010 , Google announced it had also closed the acquisition of the mobile ad network Ad@@ Mo@@ b .
in July 2010 , Google signed an agreement with an I@@ ow@@ a wind farm to buy 1@@ 14 megawat@@ ts of energy for 20 years .
in a post on Google 's blog , Google Chief Executive and co @@@ -@@ @ founder Lar@@ ry page revealed that the acquisition was a strategic move to strengthen Google 's pat@@ ent portfolio .
the sister service , Google Ad@@ Sen@@ se , allows website owners to display these adverti@@ sem@@ ents on their website and earn money every time ads are c@@ lic@@ ked .
as a result , Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008 .
in an attempt to adverti@@ se its own products , Google launched a website called dem@@ o S@@ lam , developed to demonstrate technology Demos of Google Pro@@ duc@@ ts .
Google inde@@ x@@ es billions of web pages , so that users can search for the information they desire through the use of key@@ words and operators .
in this case , the United States District Court of Nev@@ ada ruled in fav@@ or of Google in " Fi@@ eld V@@ . Google " and " Par@@ ker V@@ . Google . "
the publication has comp@@ iled a list of words that the web giant 's new in@@ stan@@ t search feature will not search .
though web sear@@ ches still appear in a bat@@ ch per page form@@ at , on July 23 , 2010 , dic@@ tionary defin@@ itions for certain English words began appe@@ aring above the linked results for web sear@@ ches .
the service was upgraded from Beta status on July 7 , 2009 , at which time it had 14@@ 6 million users monthly .
Google Do@@ cs , another part of Google 's productivity su@@ ite , allows users to create , E@@ dit , and collabor@@ ate on documents in an online environment , similar to Microsoft Wor@@ d .
on June 6 after the acquisition , Google created an experim@@ ental sp@@ read@@ she@@ et edi@@ ting program , which was combined with Google Do@@ cs on October 10 .
other projects Google has worked on include a new collabor@@ ative communication service , a web bro@@ w@@ ser , and a mobile operating system .
on September 1 , 2008 , Google pre @@@ -@@ @ announced the upcoming avail@@ ability of Google Ch@@ rome , an open source web bro@@ w@@ ser , which was then released on September 2 , 2008 .
on July 14 , 2011 , Google announced that Google + had reached 10 million users just two weeks after it was launched in this " limited " trial phase .
after four weeks in operation , it reached 25 million users .
some of Google 's new@@ er services , such as G@@ mail , Google News , Or@@ k@@ ut , and Ad@@ Sen@@ se origin@@ ated from these independent en@@ deav@@ ors .
the hal@@ l@@ ways are full of exercise bal@@ ls and bi@@ cy@@ c@@ les .
; New York Cit@@ y@@ In 2006 , Google moved into of office space in New York City , at 1@@ 11 eighth Av@@ en@@ ue in Man@@ hat@@ tan .
; O@@ ther U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ c@@ iti@@ es@@ By late 2006 , Google established a new headquarters for its Ad@@ Wor@@ ds division in An@@ n Ar@@ bor , Mic@@ hi@@ gan .
the idea of tri@@ m@@ ming law@@ ns using go@@ ats origin@@ ated from R@@ . J@@ . W@@ id@@ lar , an engine@@ er who worked for National Sem@@ ic@@ on@@ duc@@ tor .
in 2008 , Google announced G@@ mail Cust@@ om time where users could change the time that the em@@ ail was sent .
in 2011 , Google announced G@@ mail Mo@@ tion , an inter@@ active way of controlling G@@ mail and the computer with body movements via the us@@ er 's web@@ cam .
Google 's services contain Easter eg@@ gs , such as the Swedish C@@ he@@ f 's " Bor@@ k bor@@ k bor@@ k , " pi@@ g Latin , " h@@ ack@@ er " or le@@ et@@ speak , El@@ mer Fu@@ d@@ d , Pir@@ ate , and K@@ l@@ ing@@ on as language selec@@ tions for its search engine .

like other biological mac@@ ro@@ mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les such as pol@@ y@@ sac@@ char@@ ides and n@@ uc@@ le@@ ic ac@@ ids , prote@@ ins are essential parts of organis@@ ms and participate in virtually every process within cells .
other prote@@ ins are important in cell sign@@ aling , im@@ mun@@ e responses , cell ad@@ hesion , and the cell cycle .
all prote@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic am@@ ino ac@@ ids poss@@ ess common structural features , including an α @@@ -@@ @ car@@ bon to which an am@@ ino group , a car@@ box@@ y@@ l group , and a vari@@ able side chain are bon@@ ded .
because DNA contains four n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des , the total number of possible co@@ d@@ ons is 64 ; hence , there is some red@@ un@@ dan@@ cy in the gen@@ etic code , with some am@@ ino ac@@ ids specified by more than one co@@ don .
in contrast , eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes make m@@ R@@ NA in the cell n@@ uc@@ le@@ us and then trans@@ locate it across the nuclear mem@@ bran@@ e into the cy@@ topl@@ as@@ m , where prote@@ in syn@@ th@@ es@@ is then takes place .
the en@@ z@@ y@@ me am@@ in@@ o@@ ac@@ y@@ l t@@ R@@ NA syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase " charges " the t@@ R@@ NA mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les with the correct am@@ ino ac@@ ids .
prote@@ ins are always bi@@ os@@ yn@@ th@@ es@@ ized from N @@@ -@@ @ termin@@ us to C @@@ -@@ @ termin@@ us .
ye@@ ast prote@@ ins are on average 4@@ 66 am@@ ino ac@@ ids long and 53 k@@ D@@ a in mass .
the largest known prote@@ ins are the tit@@ ins , a component of the mus@@ cle sar@@ com@@ ere , with a mo@@ lec@@ ular mass of almost 3,000 k@@ D@@ a and a total length of almost 2@@ 7,000 am@@ ino ac@@ ids .
these methods are useful in laboratory bio@@ chem@@ istry and cell bi@@ ology , though generally not for commercial applications .
Bi@@ o@@ chem@@ ists often refer to four distinc@@ t aspects of a prote@@ in 's structure : * " Pri@@ m@@ ary structure " : the am@@ ino ac@@ id sequ@@ ence .
because secondary structures are local , many regions of different secondary structure can be present in the same prote@@ in mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e .
* " ter@@ ti@@ ary structure " : the overall shape of a single prote@@ in mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e ; the sp@@ ati@@ al relationship of the secondary structures to one another .
almost all glo@@ bu@@ lar prote@@ ins are sol@@ ub@@ le and many are en@@ z@@ y@@ mes .
common experim@@ ental methods of structure determination include X @@@ -@@ @ ray cr@@ y@@ stal@@ lo@@ graphy and N@@ MR spec@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ y , both of which can produce information at at@@ om@@ ic resolution .
solved structures are usually depos@@ ited in the prote@@ in D@@ ata Bank ( P@@ D@@ B ) , a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of prote@@ ins can be obtained in the form of Car@@ te@@ sian co@@ ordin@@ ates for each atom in the prote@@ in .
the set of prote@@ ins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its prote@@ ome .
the region of the prote@@ in responsible for binding another mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e is known as the binding site and is often a de@@ pression or " poc@@ ket " on the mo@@ lec@@ ular sur@@ face .
this binding ability is mediated by the ter@@ ti@@ ary structure of the prote@@ in , which defin@@ es the binding site poc@@ ket , and by the chemical properties of the surrounding am@@ ino ac@@ ids ' side cha@@ ins .
= = = en@@ z@@ y@@ mes = = = The best @@@ -@@ @ known role of prote@@ ins in the cell is as en@@ z@@ y@@ mes , which cataly@@ ze chemical reactions .
= = = Cel@@ l sign@@ aling and lig@@ and binding = = = M@@ any prote@@ ins are involved in the process of cell sign@@ aling and signal trans@@ du@@ ction .
some prote@@ ins , such as ins@@ ul@@ in , are extr@@ ac@@ el@@ lular prote@@ ins that trans@@ mit a signal from the cell in which they were syn@@ th@@ es@@ ized to other cells in distant tis@@ sues .
Anti@@ bodies are prote@@ in components of an adap@@ tive im@@ mun@@ e system whose main function is to bin@@ d anti@@ gen@@ s , or foreign substan@@ ces in the body , and target them for destruction .
many lig@@ and transport prote@@ ins bin@@ d particular small bi@@ omo@@ lec@@ u@@ les and transport them to other locations in the body of a mul@@ tic@@ el@@ lular organ@@ ism .
other prote@@ ins that serve structural functions are motor prote@@ ins such as my@@ os@@ in , kin@@ es@@ in , and dy@@ ne@@ in , which are capable of gener@@ ating mechan@@ ical forces .
for natural prote@@ ins , a series of pur@@ ification steps may be necessary to obtain prote@@ in sufficiently p@@ ure for laboratory applications .
to simplif@@ y this process , gen@@ etic engineering is often used to add chemical features to prote@@ ins that make them easier to pur@@ ify without affecting their structure or activity .
here , a " ta@@ g " consisting of a specific am@@ ino ac@@ id sequ@@ ence , often a series of h@@ isti@@ dine resi@@ du@@ es ( a " H@@ is @@@ -@@ @ ta@@ g " ) , is att@@ ached to one termin@@ us of the prote@@ in .
= = = cel@@ lular lo@@ cal@@ ization = = = The study of prote@@ ins " in vi@@ vo " is often concerned with the syn@@ th@@ es@@ is and lo@@ cal@@ ization of the prote@@ in within the cell .
a useful techni@@ que for assessing cel@@ lular lo@@ cal@@ ization uses gen@@ etic engineering to express in a cell a fu@@ sion prote@@ in or ch@@ im@@ era consisting of the natural prote@@ in of interest linked to a " reporter " such as green f@@ lu@@ o@@ res@@ cent prote@@ in ( G@@ F@@ P ) .
through another gen@@ etic engineering application known as site @@@ -@@ @ directed mut@@ agen@@ es@@ is , researchers can al@@ ter the prote@@ in sequ@@ ence and hence its structure , cel@@ lular lo@@ cal@@ ization , and sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to regulation .
P@@ hy@@ lo@@ gen@@ etic trees can be constructed and evol@@ utionary hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es developed using special software like C@@ lu@@ stal@@ W regarding the an@@ ces@@ try of modern organis@@ ms and the gen@@ es they express .
many structure pre@@ diction methods have served to inform the emerging field of prote@@ in engineering , in which novel prote@@ in fol@@ ds have already been designed .

= = nut@@ ri@@ tion = = Most micro@@ organis@@ ms and plants can bi@@ os@@ yn@@ th@@ es@@ ize all 20 standard am@@ ino ac@@ ids , while animals ( including hum@@ ans ) must obtain some of the am@@ ino ac@@ ids from the di@@ et .
in animals , am@@ ino ac@@ ids are obtained through the consumption of foods containing prote@@ in .
A@@ min@@ o ac@@ ids are also an important di@@ etary source of nit@@ ro@@ gen .
prote@@ ins were first described by the Dutch chem@@ ist Ger@@ ar@@ du@@ s Johan@@ nes Mul@@ der and named by the Swedish chem@@ ist J@@ ön@@ s Jac@@ o@@ b Ber@@ z@@ eli@@ us in 18@@ 38 .
Mul@@ der went on to identify the products of prote@@ in de@@ grad@@ ation such as the am@@ ino ac@@ id le@@ uc@@ ine for which he found a ( nearly correct ) mo@@ lec@@ ular weight of 1@@ 31 D@@ a .

Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations are a set of partial differ@@ ential equ@@ ations that , together with the Lor@@ ent@@ z force law , form the foundation of classical elec@@ tro@@ dynam@@ ics , classical op@@ tics , and electric cir@@ cu@@ its .
these fields in turn under@@ lie modern electrical and communications technologies .
Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations describe how electric and mag@@ ne@@ tic fields are generated and alter@@ ed by each other and by charges and curren@@ ts .
they are named after the S@@ co@@ tti@@ sh physi@@ cist and ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian James cler@@ k Max@@ well , who published an early form of those equ@@ ations between 18@@ 61 and 18@@ 62 .
the equ@@ ations have two major vari@@ ants .
the term " Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations " is often used for other forms of Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations .
excep@@ tions occur when the parti@@ cle nature of light is important or for very strong electric fields .
the sources of these fields are electric charges and electric curren@@ ts , which can be expressed as local den@@ si@@ ties name@@ ly charge den@@ s@@ ity and current den@@ s@@ ity .
a separate law of nature , the Lor@@ ent@@ z force law , describes how the electric and mag@@ ne@@ tic field act on charged parti@@ c@@ les and curren@@ ts .
conven@@ tions differ with the unit systems , because various defin@@ itions and dimen@@ sions are changed by absor@@ bing dimen@@ sion@@ ful factors like the speed of light .
other units com@@ mon@@ ly used are G@@ aus@@ sian units based on the c@@ gs system , Lor@@ ent@@ z @@@ -@@ @ He@@ avis@@ ide units ( used mainly in parti@@ cle physi@@ cs ) , and Plan@@ ck units ( used in the@@ ore@@ tical physi@@ cs ) .
see below for the formu@@ lation with G@@ aus@@ sian units .
( v@@ ec@@ tor area is also den@@ oted by rather than , but this conflicts with the mag@@ ne@@ tic potential , a separate v@@ ec@@ tor field ) .
equivalent technical statements are that the sum total mag@@ ne@@ tic f@@ lu@@ x through any G@@ aus@@ sian sur@@ face is zero , or that the mag@@ ne@@ tic field is a sol@@ en@@ o@@ id@@ al v@@ ec@@ tor field .
this dynam@@ ically indu@@ ced electric field has closed field lines just as the mag@@ ne@@ tic field , if not super@@ posed by a st@@ atic ( charge indu@@ ced ) electric field .
this aspect of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic indu@@ ction is the operating principle behind many electric gener@@ ators : for example , a rotating bar mag@@ net creates a changing mag@@ ne@@ tic field , which in turn gener@@ ates an electric field in a nearby w@@ ire .
Max@@ well understood the connection between elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic waves and light in 18@@ 61 , there@@ by un@@ ifying the the@@ ories of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism and op@@ tics .
a sin@@ us@@ o@@ id@@ al plane wave is one special solution of these equ@@ ations .
Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations explain how these waves can physi@@ cally propag@@ ate through space .
this perpet@@ ual cycle allows these waves , now known as elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation , to move through space at v@@ el@@ o@@ city .
it is sometimes called the general form of Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations or " Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations in a vac@@ u@@ um . "
when using c@@ gs units it is conventional to use a slightly different defin@@ ition of electric field .
often , they are also called the Max@@ well equ@@ ations .
the direct space @@@ -@@ @ time formu@@ lations make manif@@ est that the Max@@ well equ@@ ations are rela@@ tivis@@ tically inv@@ ar@@ i@@ ant ( in fact studying the hidden sym@@ me@@ try of the v@@ ec@@ tor cal@@ cul@@ us formu@@ lation was a major source of in@@ spir@@ ation for rela@@ tivity theory ) .
in addition , the formu@@ lation using poten@@ ti@@ als was originally introduced as a conven@@ i@@ ent way to solve the equ@@ ations but with all the ob@@ serv@@ able physi@@ cs contained in the fields .
see the main articles for the details of each formu@@ lation .
other formu@@ lations include the geo@@ metric Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a formu@@ lation and a mat@@ ri@@ x representation of Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations .
= = Sol@@ utions = = Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations are partial differ@@ ential equ@@ ations that rela@@ te the electric and mag@@ ne@@ tic fields to each other and to the electric charges and curren@@ ts .
often , the charges and curren@@ ts are themselves dependent on the electric and mag@@ ne@@ tic fields via the Lor@@ ent@@ z force equ@@ ation and the constitu@@ tive relations .
in fact , the solutions of these equ@@ ations en@@ comp@@ ass all the di@@ verse phenom@@ ena in the entire field of classical elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism .
like any differ@@ ential equ@@ ation , bo@@ und@@ ary conditions and initial conditions are necessary for a unique solution .
for example , even with no charges and no curren@@ ts anywhere in sp@@ ac@@ etime , many solutions to Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations are possible , not just the obvious solution .
another solution is , , while yet other solutions have elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic waves filling sp@@ ac@@ etime .
num@@ er@@ ical methods for differ@@ ential equ@@ ations can be used to approximately solve Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations when an exact solution is impossible .
these methods usually require a computer , and include the fin@@ ite element method and fin@@ ite @@@ -@@ @ difference time @@@ -@@ @ dom@@ ain method .
= = vari@@ ations = = Pop@@ ular vari@@ ations on the Max@@ well equ@@ ations as a classical theory of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic fields are relatively scar@@ ce because the standard equ@@ ations have stood the test of time remar@@ kab@@ ly well .
if they did exist , both G@@ aus@@ s 's law for mag@@ ne@@ tism and Far@@ aday 's law would need to be modi@@ fied , and the resulting four equ@@ ations would be fully sym@@ metric under the inter@@ change of electric and mag@@ ne@@ tic fields .

it is difficult to give a comprehensive defin@@ ition of energy because of its many forms , but one common defin@@ ition is that it is the ability of a system to perform work .
an example is mechan@@ ical energy which is the sum of ( usually mac@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic ) kin@@ etic and potential energy in a system .
.@@ The list is also not necessarily complete .
the distinc@@ tions between different kinds of energy is not always clear @@@ -@@ @ cut .
G@@ ust@@ ave @@@ -@@ @ Gaspar@@ d Cor@@ i@@ ol@@ is described " kin@@ etic energy " in 18@@ 29 in its modern sense , and in 18@@ 53 , William Ran@@ k@@ ine co@@ ined the term " potential energy . "
the law of conserv@@ ation of energy , was also first pos@@ tu@@ lated in the early 19th century , and applies to any isolated system .
it was argued for some years whether heat was a physical sub@@ stance , dubbed the cal@@ oric , or mer@@ ely a physical quanti@@ ty , such as momentum .
in 18@@ 45 James Pres@@ cot@@ t Jo@@ ule discovered the link between mechan@@ ical work and the generation of heat .
it also led to a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal formu@@ lation of the concept of ent@@ rop@@ y by Clau@@ si@@ us and to the introduction of laws of radi@@ ant energy by Jo@@ ž@@ ef Stefan .
it is equal to the energy expen@@ ded ( or work done ) in applying a force of one new@@ ton through a distance of one metre .
= = = Ch@@ em@@ istry = = = In the context of chem@@ istry , energy is an attri@@ bute of a sub@@ stance as a consequence of its at@@ om@@ ic , mo@@ lec@@ ular or ag@@ gre@@ gate structure .
= = = Bi@@ ology = = = In bi@@ ology , energy is an attri@@ bute of all biological systems from the Bi@@ os@@ phere to the smal@@ lest living organ@@ ism .
within an organ@@ ism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organ@@ elle of a biological organ@@ ism .
for tasks lasting a few minutes , a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 wat@@ ts .
for an activity that must be sustained for an hour , output dro@@ ps to around 300 ; for an activity kept up all day , 150 wat@@ ts is about the maximum .
in growing organis@@ ms the energy that is conver@@ ted to heat serves a vital purpose , as it allows the organ@@ ism tis@@ sue to be highly ordered with regard to the mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les it is built from .
simp@@ ler organis@@ ms can achieve higher energy effici@@ encies than more complex ones , but the complex organis@@ ms can occup@@ y ecological nic@@ hes that are not available to their simp@@ ler bre@@ th@@ ren .
examples of trans@@ duc@@ ers include a bat@@ tery , from chemical energy to electric energy ; a dam : gra@@ vit@@ ational potential energy to kin@@ etic energy of moving water ( and the bla@@ des of a tur@@ bine ) and ultimately to electric energy through an electric gener@@ ator .
there are strict limits to how efficiently energy can be conver@@ ted into other forms of energy via work , and heat as described by Car@@ not 's the@@ o@@ rem and the second law of ther@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics .
these limits are especially evident when an engine is used to perform work .
however , some energy trans@@ form@@ ations can be quite efficient .
this energy is triggered and released in nuclear fis@@ sion bombs or in civil nuclear power generation .
similarly , in the case of a chemical explosion , chemical potential energy is transformed to kin@@ etic energy and thermal energy in a very short time .
yet another example is that of a pen@@ dul@@ um .
at its highest points the kin@@ etic energy is zero and the gra@@ vit@@ ational potential energy is at maximum .
at its lowest point the kin@@ etic energy is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy .
it is also equivalent to mass , and this mass is always associated with it .
in different the@@ ore@@ tical fra@@ me@@ works , similar formu@@ las were der@@ ived by J@@ . J@@ . Thom@@ son ( 18@@ 81 ) , Hen@@ ri Po@@ inc@@ ar@@ é ( 19@@ 00 ) , Fri@@ ed@@ rich Has@@ en@@ ö@@ h@@ r@@ l ( 19@@ 04 ) and others ( see Mas@@ s @@@ -@@ @ energy equi@@ val@@ ence # History for further information ) .
a reversible process is one in which this sort of dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation does not happen .
for example , con@@ version of energy from one type of potential field to another , is reversible , as in the pen@@ dul@@ um system described above .
in this case , energy can only be ex@@ changed between adj@@ ac@@ ent regions of space , and all observers agree as to the vol@@ u@@ metric den@@ s@@ ity of energy in any given space .
this law is a fundamental principle of physi@@ cs .
put differ@@ ently , yes@@ ter@@ day , today , and tomorrow are physi@@ cally in@@ distingu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble .
this is because energy is the quanti@@ ty which is can@@ on@@ ical con@@ j@@ ug@@ ate to time .
this ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal ent@@ ang@@ lement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any defin@@ ite time inter@@ val .
the uncertainty principle should not be conf@@ used with energy conserv@@ ation - rather it provides ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal limits to which energy can in principle be defined and meas@@ ured .
each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy , and all types of potential energy ( like all other types of energy ) appears as system mass , wh@@ en@@ ever present .
for example , a com@@ pressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was com@@ pressed .
= = = Open systems = = = There are other ways in which an open system can gain or lose energy .
where formula _ 15 in this general equ@@ ation represents other additional adv@@ ected energy terms not covered by work done on a system , or heat added to it .
= = T@@ her@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics = = = = = Internal energy = = = Internal energy is the sum of all mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic forms of energy of a system .
it is the energy needed to create the system .
it is related to the potential energy , e@@ .@@ g@@ . , mo@@ lec@@ ular structure , cr@@ y@@ st@@ al structure , and other geo@@ metric aspects , as well as the motion of the parti@@ c@@ les , in form of kin@@ etic energy .
the general formu@@ lation of the first law ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . , conserv@@ ation of energy ) is valid even in situations in which the system is not h@@ omo@@ gen@@ e@@ ous .
= = = E@@ qu@@ i@@ partition of energy = = = The energy of a mechan@@ ical harmonic os@@ cil@@ la@@ tor ( a mass on a spring ) is alternati@@ vely kin@@ etic and potential .
at two points in the os@@ cil@@ lation cycle it is entirely kin@@ etic , and alternati@@ vely at two other points it is entirely potential .
this principle is vit@@ ally important to understanding the behaviour of a quanti@@ ty closely related to energy , called ent@@ rop@@ y .
En@@ tro@@ p@@ y is a measure of even@@ ness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system .
Microsoft Qu@@ ic@@ k@@ B@@ A@@ S@@ IC ( also Q@@ B ) is an In@@ tegrated Development Environment ( or I@@ D@@ E ) and comp@@ iler for the basic programming language that was developed by Microsoft .

Archi@@ me@@ des of Sy@@ rac@@ use ( ; ; BC - BC ) was an An@@ cient Greek ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian , physi@@ cist , engine@@ er , invent@@ or , and as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer .

within cells , DNA is organized into long structures called ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes .
these comp@@ act structures guide the inter@@ actions between DNA and other prote@@ ins , helping control which parts of the DNA are trans@@ cri@@ bed .
according to another study , when meas@@ ured in a particular solution , the DNA chain meas@@ ured 22 to 26 å@@ n@@ g@@ str@@ ö@@ ms wide ( 2.2 to 2.@@ 6 nano@@ metres ) , and one n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ de unit meas@@ ured 3.3 Å ( 0.@@ 33 N@@ M ) long .
although each individual repe@@ ating unit is very small , DNA pol@@ y@@ mers can be very large mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les containing millions of n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des .
for instance , the largest human ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome , ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome number 1 , consists of approximately 220 million base p@@ airs and is 85 M@@ M long .
these two long str@@ ands ent@@ wine like v@@ ines , in the shape of a double hel@@ i@@ x .
a n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ base linked to a sugar is called a n@@ uc@@ le@@ os@@ ide and a base linked to a sugar and one or more ph@@ os@@ ph@@ ate groups is called a n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ de .
the sugar in DNA is 2 @@@ -@@ @ de@@ ox@@ y@@ ri@@ b@@ ose , which is a p@@ ent@@ ose ( five @@@ -@@ @ car@@ bon ) sugar .
one major difference between DNA and R@@ NA is the sugar , with the 2 @@@ -@@ @ de@@ ox@@ y@@ ri@@ b@@ ose in DNA being replaced by the alternative p@@ ent@@ ose sugar ri@@ b@@ ose in R@@ NA .
the four bases found in DNA are ad@@ en@@ ine ( ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ated A ) , cy@@ tos@@ ine ( C ) , gu@@ an@@ ine ( G ) and th@@ y@@ mine ( T ) .
the two str@@ ands of DNA in a double hel@@ i@@ x can therefore be pulled apart like a z@@ ip@@ per , either by a mechan@@ ical force or high temper@@ ature .
as a result of this comple@@ men@@ tar@@ ity , all the information in the double @@@ -@@ @ st@@ ran@@ ded sequ@@ ence of a DNA hel@@ i@@ x is du@@ p@@ lic@@ ated on each Str@@ and , which is vital in DNA rep@@ lic@@ ation .
indeed , this reversible and specific inter@@ action between comple@@ mentary base p@@ airs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organis@@ ms .
the two types of base p@@ airs form different numbers of hydro@@ gen bonds , AT forming two hydro@@ gen bonds , and G@@ C forming three hydro@@ gen bonds ( see figures , right ) .
in the laboratory , the strength of this inter@@ action can be meas@@ ured by finding the temper@@ ature necessary to break the hydro@@ gen bonds , their mel@@ ting temper@@ ature ( also called " T@@ m " value ) .
when all the base p@@ airs in a DNA double hel@@ i@@ x mel@@ t , the str@@ ands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les .
= = = Sen@@ se and anti@@ sense = = = A DNA sequ@@ ence is called " sense " if its sequ@@ ence is the same as that of a mes@@ sen@@ ger R@@ NA cop@@ y that is translated into prote@@ in .
one proposal is that anti@@ sense R@@ NA@@ s are involved in regulating gen@@ e expression through R@@ NA @@@ -@@ @ R@@ NA base p@@ air@@ ing .
in these cases , some DNA sequ@@ ences do double duty , en@@ co@@ ding one prote@@ in when read along one Str@@ and , and a second prote@@ in when read in the opposite direction along the other Str@@ and .
if the DNA is tw@@ isted in the direction of the hel@@ i@@ x , this is positive super@@ co@@ iling , and the bases are held more tigh@@ tly together .
if they are tw@@ isted in the opposite direction , this is negative super@@ co@@ iling , and the bases come apart more easily .
these unusual structures can be recogn@@ ized by specific Z @@@ -@@ @ DNA binding prote@@ ins and may be involved in the regulation of trans@@ cri@@ ption .
the type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mut@@ ag@@ en .
the set of ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes in a cell makes up its gen@@ ome ; the human gen@@ ome has approximately 3 billion base p@@ airs of DNA arran@@ ged into 46 ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes .
the details of these functions are covered in other articles ; here we focus on the inter@@ actions between DNA and other mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les that mediate the function of the gen@@ ome .
the gen@@ etic information in a gen@@ ome is held within gen@@ es , and the complete set of this information in an organ@@ ism is called its gen@@ oty@@ pe .
a gen@@ e is a unit of her@@ edi@@ ty and is a region of DNA that influ@@ ences a particular character@@ istic in an organ@@ ism .
in many species , only a small frac@@ tion of the total sequ@@ ence of the gen@@ ome en@@ co@@ des prote@@ in .
however , some DNA sequ@@ ences that do not code prote@@ in may still en@@ code functional non @@@ -@@ @ co@@ ding R@@ NA mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les , which are involved in the regulation of gen@@ e expression .
some non@@ co@@ ding DNA sequ@@ ences play structural roles in ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes .
Tel@@ om@@ er@@ es and cent@@ ro@@ mer@@ es typically contain few gen@@ es , but are important for the function and stability of ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes .
these sequ@@ ences are usually just mo@@ lec@@ ular fos@@ sil@@ s , although they can occasi@@ onally serve as raw gen@@ etic material for the creation of new gen@@ es through the process of gen@@ e du@@ p@@ lic@@ ation and di@@ ver@@ gence .
within a gen@@ e , the sequ@@ ence of bases along a DNA Str@@ and defin@@ es a mes@@ sen@@ ger R@@ NA sequ@@ ence , which then defin@@ es one or more prote@@ in sequ@@ ences .
these en@@ code the twenty standard am@@ ino ac@@ ids , giving most am@@ ino ac@@ ids more than one possible co@@ don .
there are also three ' stop ' or ' non@@ sense ' co@@ d@@ ons sig@@ ni@@ fying the end of the co@@ ding region ; these are the TA@@ A , T@@ G@@ A , and ta@@ g co@@ d@@ ons .
here , the two str@@ ands are separated and then each Str@@ and 's comple@@ mentary DNA sequ@@ ence is rec@@ re@@ ated by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me called DNA pol@@ y@@ mer@@ ase .
as DNA pol@@ y@@ mer@@ ases can only extend a DNA Str@@ and in a 5 ′ to 3 ′ direction , different mechanisms are used to cop@@ y the anti@@ parallel str@@ ands of the double hel@@ i@@ x .
in this way , the base on the old Str@@ and dic@@ ta@@ tes which base appears on the new Str@@ and , and the cell ends up with a perfect cop@@ y of its DNA .
= = inter@@ actions with prote@@ ins = = All the functions of DNA depend on inter@@ actions with prote@@ ins .
en@@ z@@ y@@ mes can also bin@@ d to DNA and of these , the pol@@ y@@ mer@@ ases that cop@@ y the DNA base sequ@@ ence in trans@@ cri@@ ption and DNA rep@@ lic@@ ation are particularly important .
these prote@@ ins organize the DNA into a comp@@ act structure called ch@@ ro@@ mati@@ n .
the trans@@ cri@@ ption factors do this in two ways .
consequently , these prote@@ ins are often the targets of the signal trans@@ du@@ ction processes that control responses to environmental changes or cel@@ lular differ@@ enti@@ ation and development .
the most frequently used n@@ uc@@ le@@ ases in mo@@ lec@@ ular bi@@ ology are the re@@ stri@@ ction end@@ on@@ uc@@ le@@ ases , which cut DNA at specific sequ@@ ences .
for instance , the E@@ co@@ R@@ V en@@ z@@ y@@ me shown to the left recogn@@ iz@@ es the 6 @@@ -@@ @ base sequ@@ ence 5 ′ -@@ G@@ AT@@ AT@@ C @@@ -@@ @ 3 ′ and makes a cut at the ver@@ tical line .
in nature , these en@@ z@@ y@@ mes protect bac@@ ter@@ ia against p@@ ha@@ ge infection by di@@ ges@@ ting the p@@ ha@@ ge DNA when it enters the bac@@ ter@@ ial cell , acting as part of the re@@ stri@@ ction modi@@ fication system .
they are also used in DNA repair and gen@@ etic re@@ combination .
these prote@@ ins change the amount of super@@ co@@ iling in DNA .
to begin trans@@ cri@@ bing a gen@@ e , the R@@ NA pol@@ y@@ mer@@ ase bin@@ ds to a sequ@@ ence of DNA called a promo@@ ter and separ@@ ates the DNA str@@ ands .
the four separate DNA str@@ ands are col@@ oured red , blue , green and yel@@ low .
Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ation allows ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes to exchange gen@@ etic information and produces new combin@@ ations of gen@@ es , which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evol@@ ution of new prote@@ ins .
a series of steps cataly@@ z@@ ed in part by the re@@ combin@@ ase then leads to joining of the two hel@@ ices by at least one Hol@@ li@@ day jun@@ ction , in which a segment of a single Str@@ and in each hel@@ i@@ x is an@@ ne@@ aled to the comple@@ mentary Str@@ and in the other hel@@ i@@ x .
the Hol@@ li@@ day jun@@ ction is a te@@ tra@@ h@@ edr@@ al jun@@ ction structure that can be moved along the pair of ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes , sw@@ apping one Str@@ and for another .
however , there is no direct evidence of ancient gen@@ etic systems , as recovery of DNA from most fos@@ sil@@ s is impossible .
this is because DNA survi@@ ves in the environment for less than one million years , and slowly de@@ grades into short frag@@ ments in solution .

str@@ ing searching or mat@@ ching al@@ gor@@ ith@@ ms , which find an oc@@ curr@@ ence of a sequ@@ ence of letters inside a larger sequ@@ ence of letters , were developed to search for specific sequ@@ ences of n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des .
these techniques , especially multiple sequ@@ ence al@@ ign@@ ment , are used in studying phy@@ lo@@ gen@@ etic relationships and prote@@ in function .
DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information .

the history of science is the study of the historical development of science and scientific knowledge , including both the natural sci@@ ences and social sci@@ ences .
( the history of the arts and human@@ ities is termed as the history of scholar@@ ship .
) Science is a body of emp@@ iri@@ cal , the@@ ore@@ tical , and practical knowledge about the natural world , produced by scientists who emphas@@ ize the ob@@ servation , explanation , and pre@@ diction of real world phenom@@ ena .
the English word " scientist " is relatively recent - first co@@ ined by William W@@ he@@ well in the 19th century .
for example , the dome@@ sti@@ cation of ma@@ ize for agriculture has been dated to about 9,000 years ago in southern Mexico , before the development of writing systems .
many ancient civil@@ iz@@ ations collected astronom@@ ical information in a systematic manner through simple ob@@ servation .
though they had no knowledge of the real physical structure of the plan@@ ets and stars , many the@@ ore@@ tical explan@@ ations were proposed .
basic facts about human physi@@ ology were known in some places , and al@@ chem@@ y was prac@@ ticed in several civil@@ iz@@ ations .
but their ob@@ serv@@ ations and meas@@ ure@@ ments were seem@@ ingly taken for purposes other than for scientific laws .
only a few astronom@@ ers ' names are known , such as that of K@@ id@@ in@@ nu , a Chal@@ de@@ an as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer and ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian .

the history of science was not a recogn@@ ized sub@@ field of American history in this period , and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physi@@ cians rather than professional historians .
with the work of I@@ . Bernard Co@@ h@@ en at Har@@ vard , the history of science became an established sub@@ discipline of history after 1945 .
the history of ma@@ them@@ atics , history of technology , and history of philosophy are distinc@@ t areas of research and are covered in other articles .
technology is likewise closely related to but clearly di@@ ffers from the search for emp@@ iri@@ cal truth .
history of science is an academic discipline , with an international community of specialists .
main professional organiz@@ ations for this field include the History of Science Society , the British Society for the History of Science , and the European Society for the History of Science .
the field of Science and Technology Studies , an area that over@@ la@@ ps and often in@@ forms historical studies of science , focuses on the social context of science in both contemporary and historical periods .

at this time , NATO could call on about fif@@ teen ready divisions in Central Europe , and another ten in Italy and S@@ cand@@ in@@ av@@ ia .
also at Lisbon , the post of Secretary General of NATO as the organiz@@ ation 's chief civilian was created , and Lord Is@@ may was eventually appointed to the post .
ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO 's armed forces , such as the NATO Ti@@ ger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Tro@@ phy for tank gun@@ ner@@ y .
in 19@@ 54 , the Soviet Union suggested that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe .
the incor@@ poration of West Germany into the organiz@@ ation on 9 May 19@@ 55 was described as " a decisive turning point in the history of our continent " by Hal@@ vard Lan@@ ge , Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway at the time .
a major reason for Germany 's entry into the alliance was that without German man@@ power , it would have been impossible to field enough conventional forces to res@@ ist a Soviet inv@@ asion .
de G@@ a@@ ul@@ le protested against America 's strong role in the organiz@@ ation and what he perceived as a special relationship between it and the United Kingdom .
considering the response to be un@@ satisfactory , de G@@ a@@ ul@@ le began construc@@ ting an independent defence force for his country .

this policy was called the D@@ ual Tr@@ ack policy .
NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous Eastern European nations , and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns .
this had been agreed in the T@@ wo Plus F@@ our Treaty earlier in the year .
according to Robert Zo@@ el@@ lick , a State Department official involved in the T@@ wo Plus F@@ our negotiating process , this appears to be a mis@@ perception , and no formal commitment regarding enlargement was made .
the changes brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recogn@@ ized in the adap@@ ted Con@@ ven@@ tional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty , which was signed in 1999 .
on 8 July 1997 , three former communist countries , Hungary , the Czech Republic , and Poland , were invited to join NATO , which each did in 1999 .
membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Northern and Eastern European countries to NATO : Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Slovenia , Slovakia , Bulgaria , and Romania .
they were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit , and joined NATO on 29 March 2004 , shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit .
the NATO Res@@ pon@@ se Force ( N@@ R@@ F ) was launched at the 2002 Prague summit on 21 November , the first summit in a former Co@@ mec@@ on country .

the 2006 Riga summit was held in Riga , Latvia , and highlighted the issue of energy security .
it was the first NATO summit to be held in a country that had been part of the Soviet Union .
at the April 2008 summit in Bucharest , Romania , NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania and both countries joined NATO in April 2009 .
Ukraine and Georgia were also told that they could eventually become members .
Studies for this system began in 2002 , with negotiations cen@@ tered on anti @@@ -@@ @ bal@@ l@@ istic missiles being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic .

water pip@@ es were laid only towards the end of the 19th century , and then often only with one ta@@ p per building or per story .
the kit@@ chen , located in the bas@@ ement or the ground floor , continued to be operated by servants .
in some houses , water pum@@ ps were installed , and some even had kit@@ chen sin@@ ks and dra@@ ins ( but no water on ta@@ p yet , except for some fe@@ u@@ dal kit@@ ch@@ ens in c@@ ast@@ les ) .
a large table served as a work@@ ben@@ ch ; there were at least as many chairs as there were servants , for the table in the kit@@ chen also doubled as the e@@ ating place for the servants .
living in smaller apartments , the kit@@ chen was the main room - here , the family lived .
the study or living room was sav@@ ed for special occasions such as an occasi@@ onal din@@ ner invitation .
gas was more expensive than coal , though , and thus the new technology was first installed in the wealth@@ ier homes .
gas and water pip@@ es were first installed in the big cities ; small villages were connected only much later .
social housing projects led to the next milestone : the Frankfurt Kit@@ chen .
but the Frankfurt kit@@ chen em@@ bo@@ died a standard for the rest of the 20th century in r@@ ental apartments : the " work kit@@ chen . "
practical reasons also played a role in this development : just as in the bour@@ geo@@ is homes of the past , one reason for separ@@ ating the kit@@ chen was to keep the ste@@ am and s@@ mel@@ ls of co@@ oking out of the living room .
the equipment used remained a standard for years to come : hot and cold water on ta@@ p and a kit@@ chen s@@ ink and an electrical or gas sto@@ ve and ov@@ en .
not much later , the ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ator was added as a standard item .

op@@ tics usually describes the behaviour of visible , ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let , and inf@@ rar@@ ed light .
because light is an elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic wave , other forms of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation such as X @@@ -@@ @ r@@ ays , micro@@ waves , and radio waves exhibit similar properties .
progress in elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fact elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation .
explanation of these effects requires qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
the first we@@ ar@@ able eye@@ gl@@ ass@@ es were in@@ ven@@ ted in Italy around 12@@ 86 .
in 16@@ 90 , Christi@@ a@@ an H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s proposed a wave theory for light based on suggestions that had been made by Robert Ho@@ oke in 16@@ 64 .
New@@ ton@@ ian op@@ tics was generally accepted until the early 19th century when Thomas Young and Aug@@ ustin @@@ -@@ @ Jean F@@ res@@ nel conducted experim@@ ents on the interference of light that firmly established light 's wave nature .
this work led to a theory of di@@ ff@@ rac@@ tion for light and opened an entire area of study in physical op@@ tics .
wave op@@ tics was successfully unified with elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic theory by James cler@@ k Max@@ well in the 18@@ 6@@ 0s .
in 19@@ 05 Albert E@@ in@@ stein published the theory of the photo@@ electric effect that firmly established the quanti@@ z@@ ation of light itself .

: the law of ref@@ le@@ ction says that the reflected ray lies in the plane of inci@@ dence , and the an@@ gle of ref@@ le@@ ction equ@@ als the an@@ gle of inci@@ dence .
the reflec@@ tions from these sur@@ faces can only be described statisti@@ cally , with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic structure of the material .
this is known as the Law of ref@@ le@@ ction .

r@@ ays from an object at fin@@ ite distance are focused further from the len@@ s than the fo@@ cal distance ; the closer the object is to the len@@ s , the further the image is from the len@@ s .

similar to mir@@ r@@ ors , u@@ pri@@ ght images produced by single len@@ ses are virtual while in@@ ver@@ ted images are real .
these are due to both to geo@@ metri@@ cal im@@ perf@@ ections and due to the changing index of ref@@ rac@@ tion for different w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ ths of light ( ch@@ rom@@ atic ab@@ er@@ ration ) .

hy@@ per@@ tension ( H@@ T@@ N or H@@ T ) or high blood pressure , sometimes called ar@@ ter@@ ial hy@@ per@@ tension , is a chron@@ ic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the ar@@ ter@@ ies is ele@@ v@@ ated .
normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100 @@@ -@@ @ 140 m@@ m@@ H@@ g sy@@ st@@ ol@@ ic ( top reading ) and 60 @@@ -@@ @ 90 m@@ m@@ H@@ g di@@ ast@@ ol@@ ic ( bottom reading ) .
high blood pressure is said to be present if it is often at or above 140 / 90 m@@ m@@ H@@ g .
= = Sig@@ ns and symp@@ t@@ oms = = hy@@ per@@ tension is rarely accompanied by any symp@@ t@@ oms , and its identification is usually through screening , or when seeking healthcare for an un@@ related problem .
ch@@ est p@@ ain may indicate heart mus@@ cle damage ( which may progress to m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ) or sometimes a@@ or@@ tic dis@@ section , the te@@ aring of the in@@ ner wall of the a@@ orta .
rapid deterior@@ ation of kid@@ ney function ( ac@@ ute kid@@ ney injur@@ y ) and micro@@ an@@ gi@@ op@@ ath@@ ic hem@@ ol@@ y@@ tic an@@ em@@ ia ( destruction of blood cells ) may also occur .
in these situations , rapid reduction of the blood pressure is man@@ dated to stop ongoing organ damage .
hy@@ per@@ tension results from a complex inter@@ action of gen@@ es and environmental factors .
numerous common gen@@ etic vari@@ ants with small effects on blood pressure have been identified as well as some rare gen@@ etic vari@@ ants with large effects on blood pressure but the gen@@ etic basis of hy@@ per@@ tension is still poorly understood .
the possible role of other factors such as caf@@ fe@@ ine consumption , and vit@@ amin D defic@@ i@@ ency are less clear .
In@@ sul@@ in resistance , which is common in ob@@ es@@ ity and is a component of syn@@ dro@@ me X ( or the Met@@ abol@@ ic syn@@ dro@@ me ) , is also thought to contribute to hy@@ per@@ tension .
kid@@ ney disease is the most common secondary cause of hy@@ per@@ tension .
hy@@ per@@ tension can also be caused by en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine conditions , such as C@@ us@@ hing 's syn@@ dro@@ me , hy@@ per@@ th@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m , hy@@ po@@ th@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m , ac@@ ro@@ me@@ gal@@ y , Con@@ n 's syn@@ dro@@ me or hy@@ per@@ al@@ dos@@ ter@@ on@@ ism , hy@@ per@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m and phe@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ cy@@ tom@@ a .
other causes of secondary hy@@ per@@ tension include ob@@ es@@ ity , sle@@ ep ap@@ nea , pregn@@ ancy , co@@ ar@@ c@@ tation of the a@@ orta , excessive liqu@@ or@@ ice consumption and certain pres@@ cri@@ ption medicin@@ es , her@@ bal re@@ medi@@ es and illegal drugs .
= = P@@ ath@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ ology = = In most people with established essential ( primary ) hy@@ per@@ tension , increased resistance to blood flow ( total per@@ ip@@ h@@ eral resistance ) accounts for the high pressure while cardi@@ ac output remains normal .
pul@@ se pressure ( the difference between sy@@ st@@ ol@@ ic and di@@ ast@@ ol@@ ic blood pressure ) is frequently increased in older people with hy@@ per@@ tension .
= = diagnos@@ is = = hy@@ per@@ tension is diagnos@@ ed on the basis of a persistent high blood pressure .
secondary hy@@ per@@ tension is more common in pre@@ ad@@ o@@ les@@ cent children , with most cases caused by kid@@ ney disease .
additional tests for di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes and high cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol levels are usually performed because these conditions are additional risk factors for the development of heart disease and may require treatment .
e@@ G@@ F@@ R can also provide a bas@@ eline meas@@ urement of kid@@ ney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain anti@@ hy@@ per@@ ten@@ sive drugs on kid@@ ney function .
additionally , testing of ur@@ ine samples for prote@@ in is used as a secondary indicator of kid@@ ney disease .
Elec@@ tro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram ( E@@ K@@ G / EC@@ G ) testing is done to check for evidence that the heart is under strain from high blood pressure .
it may also show whether there is th@@ ic@@ ken@@ ing of the heart mus@@ cle ( left v@@ ent@@ ri@@ cular hy@@ per@@ tro@@ phy ) or whether the heart has experienced a prior minor distur@@ ban@@ ce such as a silent heart attack .

a long term ( more than 4 weeks ) low so@@ dium di@@ et is effective in reducing blood pressure , both in people with hy@@ per@@ tension and in people with normal blood pressure .

it was common in both developed ( 3@@ 33 million ) and un@@ developed ( 6@@ 39 million ) countries .
hy@@ per@@ tension is more common in men ( though men@@ op@@ ause ten@@ ds to decrease this difference ) and in those of low soci@@ o@@ economic status .

( the physi@@ cs of " very " small parti@@ c@@ les , such as the elec@@ tr@@ on , is more accur@@ ately described by qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .

I was th@@ ril@@ led when I heard about this .
because the speed of E@@ M waves predicted by the wave equ@@ ation coinci@@ ded with the meas@@ ured speed of light , Max@@ well concluded that light itself is an E@@ M wave .
Elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of elec@@ tro@@ dynam@@ ics .
since light is an os@@ cil@@ lation it is not affected by travelling through st@@ atic electric or mag@@ ne@@ tic fields in a lin@@ e@@ ar medium such as a vac@@ u@@ um .
however , in non@@ lin@@ e@@ ar media , such as some cr@@ y@@ st@@ als , inter@@ actions can occur between light and st@@ atic electric and mag@@ ne@@ tic fields - these inter@@ actions include the Far@@ aday effect and the Ker@@ r effect .
wave character@@ isti@@ cs are more apparent when E@@ M radi@@ ation is meas@@ ured over relatively large ti@@ mes@@ cal@@ es and over large dist@@ ances while parti@@ cle character@@ isti@@ cs are more evident when measuring small ti@@ mes@@ cal@@ es and dist@@ ances .
waves of the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic spectrum v@@ ary in size , from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gam@@ ma r@@ ays smaller than atom N@@ uc@@ le@@ i .
interference is the super@@ position of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pat@@ tern .
the energy in elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic waves is sometimes called radi@@ ant energy .
since the energy levels of elec@@ tr@@ ons in At@@ oms are discre@@ te , each element and each mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e em@@ its and absor@@ bs its own character@@ istic frequ@@ encies .
these bands correspon@@ d to the allowed energy levels in the At@@ oms .
= = = Pro@@ pag@@ ation speed = = = An@@ y electric charge that acceler@@ ates , or any changing mag@@ ne@@ tic field , produces elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation .
when any w@@ ire ( or other conducting object such as an an@@ ten@@ na ) conduc@@ ts alter@@ n@@ ating current , elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation is propag@@ ated at the same frequ@@ ency as the current .
as a wave , light is character@@ ized by a v@@ el@@ o@@ city ( the speed of light ) , w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th , and frequ@@ ency .
one rule is obe@@ yed regardless of circumstances : E@@ M radi@@ ation in a vac@@ u@@ um travels at the speed of light , " relative to the observer , " regardless of the observer 's v@@ el@@ o@@ city .
( this ob@@ servation led to E@@ in@@ stein 's development of the theory of special rela@@ tivity .
) In a medium ( other than vac@@ u@@ um ) , v@@ el@@ o@@ city factor or ref@@ rac@@ tive index are considered , depending on frequ@@ ency and application .
both of these are rati@@ os of the speed in a medium to speed in a vac@@ u@@ um .

the mir@@ ror ne@@ ur@@ on system ( M@@ NS ) theory of au@@ tism hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ es that dist@@ or@@ tion in the development of the M@@ NS inter@@ fer@@ es with im@@ itation and leads to au@@ tism 's core features of social imp@@ air@@ ment and communication difficulties .
other evidence suggests the under@@ connec@@ tivity is mainly within each hem@@ is@@ phere of the cor@@ te@@ x and that au@@ tism is a dis@@ order of the association cor@@ te@@ x .
the first category focuses on deficits in social cogn@@ ition .
an extension , the extreme male brain theory , hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ es that au@@ tism is an extreme case of the male brain , defined psy@@ cho@@ metri@@ cally as individuals in whom system@@ iz@@ ing is better than emp@@ ath@@ iz@@ ing .
one strength of this theory is predic@@ ting special tal@@ ents and pe@@ aks in performance in auti@@ stic people .
these the@@ ories map well from the under@@ connec@@ tivity theory of au@@ tism .
IC@@ D @@@ -@@ @ 10 uses essentially the same defin@@ ition .
two are com@@ mon@@ ly used in au@@ tism research : the au@@ tism diagnos@@ tic interview @@@ -@@ @ revised ( A@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ R ) is a sem@@ ist@@ ruc@@ tured par@@ ent interview , and the au@@ tism diagnos@@ tic Ob@@ servation schedule ( A@@ DOS ) uses ob@@ servation and inter@@ action with the child .
the ch@@ ild@@ hood au@@ tism R@@ ating S@@ cal@@ e ( cars ) is used widely in clin@@ ical environ@@ ments to assess sever@@ ity of au@@ tism based on ob@@ servation of children .
Clinical gen@@ e@@ tics evalu@@ ations are often done once A@@ SD is diagnos@@ ed , particularly when other symp@@ t@@ oms already suggest a gen@@ etic cause .
as new gen@@ etic tests are developed several ethical , legal , and social issues will emerge .
no single treatment is best and treatment is typically ta@@ il@@ ored to the child 's needs .
available approaches include applied behavi@@ or analysis ( AB@@ A ) , develop@@ mental models , struc@@ tured teaching , speech and language ther@@ ap@@ y , social skills ther@@ ap@@ y , and occup@@ ational ther@@ ap@@ y .
a person with A@@ SD may respond at@@ y@@ pic@@ ally to medi@@ c@@ ations , the medi@@ c@@ ations can have adver@@ se effects , and no known medi@@ cation reli@@ ev@@ es au@@ tism 's core symp@@ t@@ oms of social and communication imp@@ air@@ ments .
although many alternative ther@@ ap@@ ies and interven@@ tions are available , few are supported by scientific studies .
scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing , training avail@@ ability , and par@@ ent requests .
after ch@@ ild@@ hood , key treatment issues include residential care , job training and placement , sex@@ u@@ ality , social skills , and estate planning .
children rec@@ over occasi@@ onally , so that they lose their diagnos@@ is of A@@ SD ; this occur@@ s sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not .
most children with au@@ tism lack social support , mean@@ ing@@ ful relationships , future employment opportunities or self @@@ -@@ @ determination .
rates of P@@ D@@ D @@@ -@@ @ N@@ OS 's has been estimated at 3.@@ 7 per 1,000 , A@@ sp@@ er@@ ger syn@@ dro@@ me at roughly 0.@@ 6 per 1,000 , and ch@@ ild@@ hood dis@@ integr@@ ative dis@@ order at 0.@@ 02 per 1,000 .
the number of reported cases of au@@ tism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 200@@ 0s .
A@@ sp@@ er@@ ger was investigating an A@@ SD now known as A@@ sp@@ er@@ ger syn@@ dro@@ me , though for various reasons it was not widely recogn@@ ized as a separate diagnos@@ is until 1981 .
as late as the mid @@@ -@@ @ 197@@ 0s there was little evidence of a gen@@ etic role in au@@ tism ; now it is thought to be one of the most her@@ itable of all psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric conditions .
the Internet has helped auti@@ stic individuals by@@ pass non@@ ver@@ bal C@@ ues and emo@@ tional sharing that they find so hard to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work re@@ mo@@ tely .
soci@@ ological and cultural aspects of au@@ tism have developed : some in the community seek a c@@ ure , while others believe that au@@ tism is simply another way of being .
" most bac@@ ter@@ ia have not been character@@ ized , and only about half of the phy@@ la of bac@@ ter@@ ia have species that can be grown in the laboratory .
the most common fatal bac@@ ter@@ ial diseases are res@@ pir@@ atory inf@@ ections , with tub@@ er@@ cul@@ osis alone killing about 2 million people per year , mostly in sub @@@ -@@ @ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa .
= = Ori@@ gin and early evol@@ ution = = The an@@ c@@ est@@ ors of modern bac@@ ter@@ ia were un@@ ic@@ el@@ lular micro@@ organis@@ ms that were the first forms of life to appear on Earth , about 4 billion years ago .
for about 3 billion years , all organis@@ ms were mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic , and bac@@ ter@@ ia and archae@@ a were the dominant forms of life .
however , gen@@ e sequ@@ ences can be used to re@@ construct the bac@@ ter@@ ial phy@@ lo@@ gen@@ y , and these studies indicate that bac@@ ter@@ ia di@@ ver@@ ged first from the archae@@ al / eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tic lin@@ e@@ age .
among the smal@@ lest bac@@ ter@@ ia are members of the gen@@ us " My@@ cop@@ las@@ ma , " which measure only 0.@@ 3 micro@@ metres , as small as the largest vir@@ uses .
some bac@@ ter@@ ia may be even smaller , but these ul@@ tr@@ am@@ ic@@ ro@@ bac@@ ter@@ ia are not well @@@ -@@ @ studied .
these films can range from a few micro@@ meters in th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness to up to half a meter in dep@@ th , and may contain multiple species of bac@@ ter@@ ia , pro@@ ti@@ sts and archae@@ a .
in natural environ@@ ments , such as soil or the sur@@ faces of plants , the majority of bac@@ ter@@ ia are bound to sur@@ faces in bi@@ of@@ il@@ ms .
even more complex mor@@ ph@@ ological changes are sometimes possible .
the n@@ uc@@ le@@ oid contains the ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome with its associated prote@@ ins and R@@ NA .
bac@@ ter@@ ial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fun@@ gi , which are made of cel@@ lul@@ ose and ch@@ iti@@ n , respectively .
the cell wall is essential to the survival of many bac@@ ter@@ ia , and the anti@@ bio@@ tic pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin is able to kill bac@@ ter@@ ia by in@@ hibi@@ ting a step in the syn@@ th@@ es@@ is of pe@@ p@@ ti@@ do@@ g@@ ly@@ can .
this lay@@ er provides chemical and physical protection for the cell sur@@ face and can act as a mac@@ ro@@ mo@@ lec@@ ular di@@ ff@@ usion barrier .
many types of secre@@ tion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the vir@@ ul@@ ence of path@@ o@@ gen@@ s , so are inten@@ sively studied .
the distribution of Met@@ abol@@ ic tra@@ its within a group of bac@@ ter@@ ia has traditionally been used to define their tax@@ onomy , but these tra@@ its often do not correspon@@ d with modern gen@@ etic clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ations .
bac@@ ter@@ ial met@@ abol@@ ism is classified into nut@@ ri@@ tional groups on the basis of three major criteria : the kind of energy used for growth , the source of car@@ bon , and the elec@@ tr@@ on donors used for growth .
car@@ bon met@@ abol@@ ism in bac@@ ter@@ ia is either " het@@ er@@ ot@@ rop@@ hic , " where organ@@ ic car@@ bon compo@@ unds are used as car@@ bon sources , or " aut@@ ot@@ rop@@ hic , " meaning that cel@@ lular car@@ bon is obtained by fixing car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide .
this reaction rele@@ ases energy that can be used to syn@@ th@@ es@@ ise ATP and drive met@@ abol@@ ism .
in " ana@@ ero@@ bic organis@@ ms " other in@@ organ@@ ic compo@@ unds , such as nit@@ rate , sul@@ fate or car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide are used as elec@@ tr@@ on accep@@ tors .
Fer@@ ment@@ ation is possible , because the energy content of the sub@@ stra@@ tes is higher than that of the products , which allows the organis@@ ms to syn@@ th@@ es@@ ise ATP and drive their met@@ abol@@ ism .
Li@@ th@@ ot@@ rop@@ hic bac@@ ter@@ ia can use in@@ organ@@ ic compo@@ unds as a source of energy .
common in@@ organ@@ ic elec@@ tr@@ on donors are hydro@@ gen , car@@ bon mon@@ ox@@ ide , am@@ mon@@ ia ( leading to nit@@ ri@@ fication ) , fer@@ ro@@ us iron and other reduced metal ions , and several reduced sul@@ f@@ ur compo@@ unds .
in unusual circumstances , the gas me@@ than@@ e can be used by me@@ than@@ ot@@ rop@@ hic bac@@ ter@@ ia as both a source of elec@@ tr@@ ons and a sub@@ str@@ ate for car@@ bon an@@ abol@@ ism .
in addition to fixing car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide in pho@@ tos@@ yn@@ th@@ es@@ is , some bac@@ ter@@ ia also fix nit@@ ro@@ gen gas ( nit@@ ro@@ gen fi@@ x@@ ation ) using the en@@ z@@ y@@ me nit@@ ro@@ gen@@ ase .
this environment@@ ally important tra@@ it can be found in bac@@ ter@@ ia of nearly all the Met@@ abol@@ ic types listed above , but is not universal .
= = Growth and re@@ production = = Un@@ like in mul@@ tic@@ el@@ lular organis@@ ms , increases in cell size ( cell growth ) and re@@ production by cell division are tigh@@ tly linked in un@@ ic@@ el@@ lular organis@@ ms .
under op@@ ti@@ mal conditions , bac@@ ter@@ ia can grow and divide extremely rapidly , and bac@@ ter@@ ial populations can double as quickly as every 9.@@ 8 minutes .
however , liqu@@ id growth media are used when meas@@ urement of growth or large vol@@ u@@ mes of cells are required .
the use of selec@@ tive media ( media with specific nut@@ ri@@ ents added or defic@@ i@@ ent , or with anti@@ bio@@ tics added ) can help identify specific organis@@ ms .
most laboratory techniques for growing bac@@ ter@@ ia use high levels of nut@@ ri@@ ents to produce large amounts of cells cheap@@ ly and quickly .
however , in natural environ@@ ments , nut@@ ri@@ ents are limited , meaning that bac@@ ter@@ ia can@@ not continue to re@@ produce inde@@ fin@@ itely .
this nut@@ ri@@ ent limit@@ ation has led the evol@@ ution of different growth strategies ( see R / K selection theory ) .
these relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organ@@ ism or group of organis@@ ms ( syn@@ tro@@ phy ) .
the rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the " growth rate " ( " K " ) , and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the " generation time " ( " G " ) .
the st@@ ation@@ ary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of gen@@ es involved in DNA repair , anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant met@@ abol@@ ism and nut@@ ri@@ ent transport .
Sp@@ i@@ ro@@ chae@@ tes of the gen@@ us " Bor@@ reli@@ a " are a no@@ table exception to this arrangement , with bac@@ ter@@ ia such as " Bor@@ reli@@ a bur@@ g@@ dor@@ feri , " the cause of Ly@@ me disease , containing a single lin@@ e@@ ar ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome .
the gen@@ es in bac@@ ter@@ ial gen@@ omes are usually a single continuous stretch of DNA and although several different types of in@@ tr@@ ons do exist in bac@@ ter@@ ia , these are much more rare than in eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes .
however , all bac@@ ter@@ ia can evol@@ ve by selection on changes to their gen@@ etic material DNA caused by gen@@ etic re@@ combination or mut@@ ations .
Mut@@ ations come from err@@ ors made during the rep@@ lic@@ ation of DNA or from exposure to mut@@ ag@@ ens .
mut@@ ation rates v@@ ary widely among different species of bac@@ ter@@ ia and even among different cl@@ ones of a single species of bac@@ ter@@ ia .
= = = DNA transfer = = = Some bac@@ ter@@ ia also transfer gen@@ etic material between cells .
this can occur in three main ways .
Gen@@ e transfer is particularly important in anti@@ bio@@ tic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance gen@@ es between different path@@ o@@ gen@@ s .
many bac@@ ter@@ ia ( such as " E@@ . col@@ i " ) have two distinc@@ t mo@@ des of movement : forward movement ( swimming ) and t@@ umb@@ ling .
the International Committee on systematic bac@@ ter@@ i@@ ology ( IC@@ S@@ B ) maintains international rules for the nam@@ ing of bac@@ ter@@ ia and tax@@ onom@@ ic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of N@@ om@@ encla@@ ture of bac@@ ter@@ ia .
these two dom@@ ain@@ s , along with Eu@@ kar@@ ya , are the basis of the three @@@ -@@ @ dom@@ ain system , which is currently the most widely used clas@@ si@@ fication system in micro@@ bi@@ ol@@ ology .
for example , a few bi@@ ologists argue that the Archae@@ a and Eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes evol@@ ved from gram @@@ -@@ @ positive bac@@ ter@@ ia .
the " gram st@@ ain , " developed in 18@@ 84 by Hans Christian gram , character@@ ises bac@@ ter@@ ia based on the structural character@@ isti@@ cs of their cell walls .
culture techniques are designed to promote the growth and identify particular bac@@ ter@@ ia , while restric@@ ting the growth of the other bac@@ ter@@ ia in the samp@@ le .
spec@@ im@@ ens that are norm@@ ally ster@@ ile , such as blood , ur@@ ine or sp@@ inal f@@ lu@@ id , are cul@@ tured under conditions designed to grow all possible organis@@ ms .
once a path@@ o@@ gen@@ ic organ@@ ism has been isolated , it can be further characterised by its mor@@ ph@@ ology , growth pat@@ ter@@ ns ( such as a@@ ero@@ bic or ana@@ ero@@ bic growth ) , pat@@ ter@@ ns of hem@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , and st@@ ain@@ ing .
the bac@@ ter@@ ia in this association are unable to consum@@ e the organ@@ ic ac@@ ids as this reaction produces hydro@@ gen that acc@@ um@@ ulates in their surro@@ und@@ ings .
only the intim@@ ate association with the hydro@@ gen @@@ -@@ @ consum@@ ing Archae@@ a keeps the hydro@@ gen concentration low enough to allow the bac@@ ter@@ ia to grow .
many other bac@@ ter@@ ia are found as sym@@ bi@@ on@@ ts in hum@@ ans and other organis@@ ms .
a path@@ o@@ gen@@ ic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after , as was the case with " Hel@@ ic@@ ob@@ ac@@ ter p@@ y@@ lor@@ i " and pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer disease .
each species of path@@ og@@ en has a character@@ istic spectrum of inter@@ actions with its human hosts .
yet these organis@@ ms are also part of the normal human fl@@ ora and usually exist on the s@@ kin or in the n@@ ose without causing any disease at all .
finally , some species such as " P@@ se@@ u@@ dom@@ on@@ as a@@ er@@ ug@@ in@@ osa , " " Bur@@ k@@ hol@@ der@@ ia cen@@ oc@@ ep@@ ac@@ ia , " and " My@@ co@@ bac@@ ter@@ ium av@@ ium " are opportun@@ istic path@@ o@@ gen@@ s and cause disease mainly in people suffering from im@@ mun@@ os@@ up@@ pression or cy@@ stic fi@@ b@@ ros@@ is .
fer@@ tili@@ zer was added to some of the beaches in Prince William S@@ ound in an attempt to promote the growth of these n@@ atur@@ ally oc@@ curr@@ ing bac@@ ter@@ ia after the 1989 " Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ de@@ z " oil sp@@ ill .
these efforts were effective on beaches that were not too th@@ ic@@ k@@ ly covered in oil .
in the chemical industry , bac@@ ter@@ ia are most important in the production of en@@ anti@@ om@@ er@@ ically p@@ ure chem@@ ic@@ als for use as pharmac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als or agri@@ chem@@ ic@@ als .
because of their specif@@ ic@@ ity , these p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des are regarded as environment@@ ally friendly , with little or no effect on hum@@ ans , w@@ ild@@ life , pol@@ lin@@ ators and most other beneficial in@@ sec@@ ts .

in Chinese Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ism , these exist ( translated " chi@@ h ku@@ an " ) , but Ch@@ á@@ n ( Z@@ en ) medi@@ tation is more popular .
according to Peter Harvey , wh@@ en@@ ever Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ism has been healthy , not only mon@@ ks , nun@@ s , and married lam@@ as , but also more committed lay people have prac@@ ticed medi@@ tation .
according to R@@ out@@ ledge 's En@@ cycl@@ op@@ edi@@ a of Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ism , in contrast , throughout most of Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ist history before modern times , serious medi@@ tation by lay people has been unusual .

Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche 's father died from a brain ail@@ ment in 18@@ 49 ; Lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g Joseph died the next year , at age two .
after the death of Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche 's grand@@ mother in 18@@ 56 , the family moved into their own house , now Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche @@@ -@@ @ Ha@@ us , a museum and Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche study cen@@ ter .
Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche attended a boys ' school and then , later , a private school , where he became friends with G@@ ust@@ av Kru@@ g , Ru@@ dol@@ f W@@ ag@@ ner , and Wil@@ helm P@@ in@@ der , all of whom came from highly respected families .
in 18@@ 54 , he began to attend Dom@@ gy@@ mnasium in Naum@@ burg but since he showed particular tal@@ ents in music and language , the internationally recogn@@ ized Sch@@ ul@@ p@@ for@@ ta admitted him as a pup@@ il .
he transferred and studied there from 18@@ 58 to 18@@ 64 , becoming friends with Paul De@@ us@@ sen and Carl von Ger@@ s@@ dor@@ ff .
he also found time to work on po@@ em@@ s and musical com@@ positions .
his end @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ se@@ mes@@ ter ex@@ ams in March 18@@ 64 showed a 1 in Reli@@ gi@@ on and German ; a 2@@ a in Greek and Latin ; a 2@@ b in French , History , and P@@ hy@@ sics ; and a " la@@ ck@@ lus@@ ter " 3 in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w and M@@ ath@@ em@@ atics .

after one se@@ mes@@ ter ( and to the an@@ ger of his mother ) he stopped his the@@ ological studies and lost his faith .
in 18@@ 65 , at the age of 20 , Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche wrote to his sister E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth , who was deeply religious , a letter regarding his loss of faith .
there , he became close friends with his fellow student Er@@ win Ro@@ h@@ de .
in 18@@ 65 , Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly studied the works of Ar@@ th@@ ur Sch@@ openha@@ u@@ er .

Walter K@@ au@@ f@@ mann spec@@ ulates that he might also have contracted sy@@ phil@@ is along with his other inf@@ ections at this time .
Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche also met Franz Over@@ bec@@ k , a professor of the@@ ology who remained his friend throughout his life .
Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche had already met Richard W@@ ag@@ ner in Le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g in 18@@ 68 and later W@@ ag@@ ner 's wife , Cos@@ ima .
Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche ad@@ mi@@ red both greatly and , during his time at Bas@@ el , he frequently visited W@@ ag@@ ner 's house in Tri@@ b@@ sch@@ en in Luc@@ er@@ ne .
in 18@@ 70 , he gave Cos@@ ima W@@ ag@@ ner the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt of " The Gen@@ es@@ is of the tra@@ gic I@@ de@@ a " as a birthday gift .
in response , Ro@@ h@@ de ( then a professor in Ki@@ el ) and W@@ ag@@ ner came to Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche 's defen@@ se .

in 18@@ 81 , when France occupied Tun@@ is@@ ia , he planned to travel to Tun@@ is to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea , probably for health reasons .
Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche occasi@@ onally returned to Naum@@ burg to visit his family , and , especially during this time , he and his sister had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation .
he is known to have tried using the H@@ ans@@ en writing B@@ all , a contemporary ty@@ pe@@ writer device .
in the end , a past student of his , Hein@@ rich Kö@@ sel@@ itz or Peter G@@ ast , became a sort of private secretary to Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche .

that year he also met L@@ ou Andreas Sal@@ om@@ é , through Mal@@ wi@@ da von Mey@@ sen@@ bug and Paul R@@ é@@ e .
Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche and Sal@@ om@@ é spent the summer together in T@@ aut@@ en@@ burg in Thur@@ ing@@ ia , often with Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche 's sister E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth as a cha@@ per@@ one .

his books remained largely un@@ sold .

during these years Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche met Meta von Sal@@ is , Carl Sp@@ it@@ teler , and Got@@ t@@ fri@@ ed K@@ eller .
during the same year , he en@@ countered the work of F@@ yo@@ dor D@@ os@@ to@@ ev@@ sky , to whom he felt an immediate kin@@ ship .
he also ex@@ changed letters with H@@ ip@@ pol@@ y@@ te Ta@@ ine and Geor@@ g Bran@@ des .

the following day , Over@@ bec@@ k received a similar letter and decided that Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche 's friends had to bring him back to Bas@@ el .
by that time Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche appeared fully in the gri@@ p of a serious mental ill@@ ness , and his mother Fran@@ z@@ is@@ ka decided to transfer him to a clinic in J@@ ena under the direction of O@@ tto B@@ ins@@ wan@@ ger .
in March 18@@ 90 , Fran@@ z@@ is@@ ka removed Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche from the clinic and , in May 18@@ 90 , brought him to her home in Naum@@ burg .

= = = Energy = = = The need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 197@@ 0s to the 1980s , both per ru@@ ble of gross social product and per ru@@ ble of industrial product .
at the start , this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 19@@ 75 .
from 19@@ 75 and 1980 , it grew even s@@ lower , only 2.@@ 6 percent .
David Wilson , a histor@@ ian , believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century .
Petroleum and pet@@ ro@@ leum @@@ -@@ @ based products , natural gas , met@@ als , wood , agricultural products , and a variety of manufac@@ tured goods , primarily machinery , arms and military equipment , were exported .
in the 197@@ 0s and 1980s , the Soviet Union heavily reli@@ ed on fos@@ sil fuel exports to earn hard currency .
at its peak in 1988 , it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of crude oil , sur@@ passed only by Saudi Arabia .
Soviet authorities proved their commitment to L@@ enin 's belief by developing massive networks , research and development organiz@@ ations .
by 1989 , Soviet scientists were among the world 's best @@@ -@@ @ trained specialists in several areas , such as energy physi@@ cs , selected areas of medicine , ma@@ them@@ atics , wel@@ ding and military technologies .
due to ri@@ g@@ id state planning and bureaucracy , the Sov@@ i@@ ets remained far behind technolo@@ g@@ ically in chem@@ istry , bi@@ ology , and computers when compared to the First World .
project So@@ c@@ rates , under the Re@@ ag@@ an administration , determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was ra@@ dic@@ ally different from what the US was using .
in the case of the US , economic pri@@ or@@ itiz@@ ation was being used for indi@@ gen@@ ous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors .
it was this significant lack of flexibility that was explo@@ ited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform .
= = = Transport = = = Transport was a key component of the nation 's economy .
the country had a wide variety of mo@@ des of transport by land , water and air .
however , due to bad maintenance , much of the road , water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technolo@@ g@@ ically back@@ ward compared to the First World .
Soviet rail transport was the largest and most inten@@ sively used in the world ; it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts .
by the late 197@@ 0s and early 1980s , Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burden from the rail@@ ways and to improve the Soviet state budget .
by the early @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ mid @@@ -@@ @ 1980s , the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by or@@ dering the construction of new ones .
meanwhile , the autom@@ obile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction .
the under@@ developed road network led to a growing demand for public transport .
despite improvements , several aspects of the transport sector were still rid@@ d@@ led with problems due to outdated infrastructure , lack of investment , corruption and bad decision @@@ -@@ @ making .
Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services .
the Soviet mer@@ chan@@ t fleet was one of the largest in the world .
= = demo@@ graph@@ ics = = exc@@ ess deaths over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War ( including the pos@@ tw@@ ar fam@@ ine ) amounted to a combined total of 18 million , some 10 million in the 19@@ 30@@ s , and more than 26 million in 19@@ 41 @@@ -@@ @ 5 .
the pos@@ tw@@ ar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre @@@ -@@ @ war demographic growth had continued .
" the crude birth rate of the US@@ SR decreased from 4@@ 4.@@ 0 per thousand in 19@@ 26 to 18.@@ 0 in 1974 , largely due to increasing ur@@ ban@@ ization and the rising average age of marri@@ ages .
the crude death rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well - from 2@@ 3.@@ 7 per thousand in 19@@ 26 to 8.@@ 7 in 1974 .
an analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late @@@ -@@ @ 197@@ 0s and the early 1980s , ad@@ ult mortality began to improve again .
the inf@@ ant mortality rate increased from 2@@ 4.@@ 7 in 1970 to 2@@ 7.@@ 9 in 1974 .
some researchers regarded the rise as largely real , a consequence of worsening health conditions and services .
the rises in both ad@@ ult and inf@@ ant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials , and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years .
Soviet demo@@ graph@@ ers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late @@@ -@@ @ 1980s , when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could del@@ ve into the real causes .
Anatol@@ y L@@ un@@ ac@@ har@@ sky became the first People 's Com@@ mis@@ sar for Education of Soviet Russia .
for a short period , quality was sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for quanti@@ ty .
in the aftermath of the Great Patri@@ otic War , the country 's educational system expanded dramatically .
this expansion had a tre@@ mend@@ ous effect .
in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , nearly all Soviet children had access to education , the only exception being those living in remote areas .
Nik@@ ita K@@ h@@ r@@ ush@@ chev tried to make education more acces@@ sible , making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society .
education also became important in giving rise to the New Man .
the country 's system of education was highly central@@ ized and uni@@ vers@@ ally acces@@ sible to all citizens , with affir@@ m@@ ative action for applicants from nations associated with cultural back@@ war@@ d@@ ness .
citizens directly entering the work force had the constitutional right to a job and to free voc@@ ational training .
the Brez@@ h@@ ne@@ v administration introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Kom@@ som@@ ol party secretary .
= = = Health = = = In 19@@ 17 , before the revolution , health conditions were significantly behind the developed countries .
the Soviet principle of health care was conce@@ ived by the People 's Com@@ mis@@ sar@@ i@@ at for Health in 19@@ 18 .
health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge , this at the time being a revol@@ utionary concept .
article 42 of the 197@@ 7 Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the US@@ SR .
before Leon@@ id Brez@@ h@@ ne@@ v became head of state , the healthcare system of the Soviet Union was held in high es@@ te@@ em by many foreign specialists .
after the socialist revolution , the life expec@@ tancy for all age groups went up .
this statisti@@ c in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was super@@ ior to the capit@@ alist system .
it remained stable during most years , although in the 197@@ 0s , it went down slightly , possibly because of alcohol abuse .
at the same time , inf@@ ant mortality began to rise .
after 1974 , the government stopped publishing statistics on this .

in comparison with Dur@@ k@@ he@@ im and Mar@@ x , We@@ ber was more focused on individuals and culture and this is clear in his meth@@ od@@ ology .
soci@@ ology , for Ma@@ x We@@ ber , is : We@@ ber was concerned with the question of objec@@ tivity and subj@@ ec@@ tivity .
social actions may have easily identi@@ fi@@ able and objective means , but much more subj@@ ec@@ tive ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another lay@@ er of subj@@ ec@@ tive understanding ( that of the scientist ) .
We@@ ber noted that the importance of subj@@ ec@@ tivity in social sci@@ ences makes creation of fo@@ ol @@@ -@@ @ proof , universal laws much more difficult than in natural sci@@ ences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sci@@ ences may achieve is prec@@ ar@@ iously limited .
therefore , We@@ ber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predic@@ ting an outcome of those processes in the future .
this theme was situated in the larger context of the relationship between psychological motiv@@ ations , cultural values and beli@@ efs ( primarily , religion ) and the structure of the society ( usually determined by the economy ) .

a scientific , industrial , or soci@@ et@@ al problem , it is necessary to begin with a population or process to be studied .
there are two major types of ca@@ usal statistical studies : experim@@ ental studies and ob@@ serv@@ ational studies .
in both types of studies , the effect of differences of an independent vari@@ able ( or vari@@ ables ) on the behavi@@ or of the dependent vari@@ able are observed .
the famous Haw@@ thor@@ ne study examined changes to the working environment at the Haw@@ thor@@ ne plant of the Western Electric Company .
= = = = Ob@@ serv@@ ational study = = = = A@@ n example of an ob@@ serv@@ ational study is one that explo@@ res the cor@@ relation between smoking and lun@@ g cancer .
this type of study typically uses a survey to collect ob@@ serv@@ ations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis .
the S@@ un is the star at the cen@@ ter of the So@@ lar System .
= = = T@@ ac@@ ho@@ cl@@ ine = = = The radi@@ ative zone and the conv@@ ec@@ tive zone are separated by a transition lay@@ er , the tac@@ ho@@ cl@@ ine .
= = = Pho@@ tos@@ phere = = = The visible sur@@ face of the S@@ un , the pho@@ tos@@ phere , is the lay@@ er below which the S@@ un becomes op@@ a@@ que to visible light .
the pho@@ tos@@ phere is tens to hundreds of kilo@@ meters th@@ ick , being slightly less op@@ a@@ que than air on Earth .
in 18@@ 68 , Nor@@ man Loc@@ k@@ yer hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ ized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed " hel@@ ium , " after the Greek S@@ un go@@ d H@@ eli@@ os .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years later , hel@@ ium was isolated on Earth .
the ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ phere , transition region , and cor@@ ona are much hot@@ ter than the sur@@ face of the S@@ un .
the reason is not well understood , but evidence suggests that Alf@@ v@@ é@@ n waves may have enough energy to heat the cor@@ ona .
the transition region does not occur at a well @@@ -@@ @ defined al@@ titu@@ de .
rather , it forms a kind of n@@ im@@ bus around ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ ic features such as sp@@ ic@@ u@@ les and fil@@ am@@ ents , and is in constant , cha@@ otic motion .
turbul@@ ence and dynamic forces in the hel@@ i@@ os@@ phere can@@ not affect the shape of the solar cor@@ ona within , because the information can only travel at the speed of Alf@@ v@@ é@@ n waves .
the solar wind travels ou@@ tw@@ ard continu@@ ously through the hel@@ i@@ os@@ phere , forming the solar mag@@ ne@@ tic field into a spir@@ al shape , until it imp@@ acts the hel@@ i@@ op@@ ause more than 50 A@@ u from the S@@ un .
at a typical solar minimum , few sun@@ spots are visible , and occasi@@ onally none can be seen at all .
this coinci@@ ded in time with the era of the Lit@@ tle I@@ ce Age , when Europe experienced un@@ usually cold temperatures .
a recent theory claims that there are mag@@ ne@@ tic in@@ st@@ abilities in the core of the S@@ un that cause f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ations with periods of either 4@@ 1,000 or 100,000 years .
these could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the Mil@@ an@@ kov@@ it@@ ch cy@@ c@@ les .
in addition , Alf@@ v@@ é@@ n waves do not easily dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate in the cor@@ ona .
= = = fa@@ int young S@@ un problem = = = the@@ ore@@ tical models of the S@@ un 's development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago , during the Arch@@ ean period , the S@@ un was only about 75 % as bright as it is today .
such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liqu@@ id water on Earth 's sur@@ face , and thus life should not have been able to develop .
however , the ge@@ ological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temper@@ ature throughout its history , and that the young Earth was somewhat war@@ mer than it is today .
in many pre@@ historic and ancient cultures , the S@@ un was thought to be a solar de@@ ity or other super@@ natural phenomenon .
the in@@ vention of the tele@@ scope in the early 17th century per@@ mitted detailed ob@@ serv@@ ations of sun@@ spots by Thomas Har@@ riot , Gal@@ il@@ e@@ o Gal@@ il@@ ei and other astronom@@ ers .
in 16@@ 72 Gi@@ ov@@ anni C@@ ass@@ ini and Jean ri@@ cher determined the distance to Mar@@ s and were there@@ by able to calc@@ ulate the distance to the S@@ un .
in the early years of the modern scientific era , the source of the S@@ un 's energy was a significant p@@ uz@@ z@@ le .
Lord Kel@@ v@@ in suggested that the S@@ un was a gradually co@@ ol@@ ing liqu@@ id body that was radi@@ ating an internal store of heat .
in 18@@ 90 Joseph Loc@@ k@@ yer , who discovered hel@@ ium in the solar spectrum , proposed a meteor@@ iti@@ c hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is for the formation and evol@@ ution of the S@@ un .
not until 19@@ 04 was a documented solution offered .
Ern@@ est Ru@@ ther@@ ford suggested that the S@@ un 's output could be maintained by an internal source of heat , and suggested radio@@ active dec@@ ay as the source .
the the@@ ore@@ tical concept of fu@@ sion was developed in the 19@@ 30@@ s by the astro@@ physi@@ c@@ ists S@@ ub@@ rah@@ man@@ yan Ch@@ and@@ ras@@ ek@@ har and Hans Be@@ the .
Hans Be@@ the calculated the details of the two main energy @@@ -@@ @ producing nuclear reactions that power the S@@ un .
= = = So@@ lar space missions = = = The first satel@@ li@@ tes designed to observe the S@@ un were NASA 's p@@ ion@@ e@@ ers 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 , which were launched between 19@@ 59 and 19@@ 68 .
these prob@@ es or@@ bi@@ ted the S@@ un at a distance similar to that of Earth , and made the first detailed meas@@ ure@@ ments of the solar wind and the solar mag@@ ne@@ tic field .
in the 197@@ 0s , two H@@ eli@@ os sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft and the Sk@@ y@@ lab A@@ pol@@ lo Tele@@ scope Mount provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar cor@@ ona .
the Sk@@ y@@ lab space station , launched by NASA in 197@@ 3 , included a solar observatory mo@@ dul@@ e called the A@@ pol@@ lo Tele@@ scope Mount that was operated by as@@ tron@@ au@@ ts resident on the station .
Sk@@ y@@ lab made the first time @@@ -@@ @ resolved ob@@ serv@@ ations of the solar transition region and of ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let emissions from the solar cor@@ ona .
in 1980 , the So@@ lar Ma@@ xim@@ um Mission was launched by NASA .
this sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft was designed to observe gam@@ ma r@@ ays , X @@@ -@@ @ r@@ ays and U@@ V radi@@ ation from solar flar@@ es during a time of high solar activity and solar l@@ umin@@ os@@ ity .
it was destroyed by atmos@@ ph@@ er@@ ic re @@@ -@@ @ entry in 2005 .
one of the most important solar missions to date has been the So@@ lar and H@@ eli@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic Ob@@ ser@@ vatory , jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995 .
the U@@ ly@@ s@@ ses probe was launched in 1990 to study the S@@ un 's po@@ lar regions .
a solar wind samp@@ le return mission , Gen@@ es@@ is , was designed to allow astronom@@ ers to directly measure the composition of solar material .
the So@@ lar Ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al Relations Ob@@ ser@@ vatory ( ST@@ ER@@ E@@ O ) mission was launched in October 2006 .

the st@@ y@@ ling of the A1 was by Tom Kar@@ en of O@@ gle Des@@ ign .
the design essentially remained this way until April 197@@ 2 .
in 1971 a special model of the A1 was developed in dedic@@ ation to the Mediterranean Games in İzmir , called the " Akdeniz " ( Mediterranean ) .
starting from 197@@ 2 , this model became the standard coup@@ é of Anad@@ ol until its production was stopped in 19@@ 75 .
the Anad@@ ol was originally only available as a coup@@ é , but in late 197@@ 3 was joined by a sal@@ o@@ on ( sed@@ an ) and an estate version .
Anad@@ ol A1 was also the first Turkish rally car , and " Anad@@ ol R@@ al@@ li Tak@@ ımı ( art ) " became the first Turkish rally team .
famous rally driver Rom@@ olo Mar@@ c@@ opol@@ i was also an A1 fan .
still in 19@@ 68 , another Turkish driver , İskender A@@ ru@@ ob@@ a , participated in the 30,000 km Africa @@@ -@@ @ Asia @@@ -@@ @ Europe T@@ our , which lasted 8 months , with his Anad@@ ol A1 .
= = Anad@@ ol S@@ TC @@@ -@@ @ 16 ( 197@@ 3 @@@ -@@ @ 19@@ 75 ) = = A sports model , the S@@ TC @@@ -@@ @ 16 , was produced between 197@@ 3 and 19@@ 75 .
designed by Er@@ al@@ p N@@ oy@@ an , the S@@ TC @@@ -@@ @ 16 was the first Turkish sports car .
it was also the second completely Turkish @@@ -@@ @ designed car after Dev@@ rim which was produced in 19@@ 61 as the first Turkish designed and built autom@@ obile .
in 1971 Erdoğan Gönül , the General Manager of Ot@@ os@@ an and the son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law of V@@ eh@@ bi Koç , convinced the latter on the production of a sports car .
the S@@ TC @@@ -@@ @ 16 had all the typical d@@ ash@@ board ga@@ ug@@ es and indicators which the British and Italian sports cars of that period had .
the first crash tests of the S@@ TC @@@ -@@ @ 16 were also performed in this period .
afterwards , the S@@ TC @@@ -@@ @ 16 was taken to England by Nih@@ at At@@ as@@ ag@@ un , Ot@@ os@@ an 's Pro@@ du@@ ction Manager , who tested the car at the M@@ .@@ I@@ .@@ R@@ .@@ A.
it had a completely different design and appearance than the 4 @@@ -@@ @ door Anad@@ ol models , and was inspired by reli@@ ant 's S@@ c@@ im@@ it@@ ar sports @@@ -@@ @ station coup@@ é .
after some time , a more lux@@ ur@@ ious version was produced , and bi @@@ -@@ @ col@@ our pain@@ t were applied , while new inter@@ i@@ ors were introduced .
= = Anad@@ ol B@@ ö@@ c@@ ek ( 19@@ 75 @@@ -@@ @ 197@@ 7 ) = = The " B@@ ö@@ c@@ ek " ( bug ) was designed by Jan N@@ ah@@ um , who , in that period , worked at Ot@@ os@@ an 's Des@@ ign and Development Department .
later in his career , N@@ ah@@ um became the General Manager of major companies like Oto@@ kar and To@@ fa@@ ş , the He@@ ad of International Business Development at FI@@ AT , and the CEO of Petrol Ofisi .
only 20@@ 3 examples of B@@ ö@@ c@@ ek were produced between 19@@ 75 and 197@@ 7 .
= = Anad@@ ol A@@ 8 @@@ -@@ @ 16 / 16 S@@ L ( 1981 @@@ -@@ @ 1984 ) = = Pro@@ du@@ ction of the 4 @@@ -@@ @ door , 5 @@@ -@@ @ seat A@@ 8 @@@ -@@ @ 16 series began in 1981 .
even the higher performance 1.6 P@@ into E @@@ -@@ @ Ma@@ x engine , which were used in the first A@@ 8 @@@ -@@ @ 16@@ s that were produced between 1981 and 1982 , could not improve the popularity of these cars .
only 1,0@@ 13 examples of the A@@ 8 @@@ -@@ @ 16 were produced between 1981 and 1984 .
today , one of these W@@ an@@ kel eng@@ ines is displayed at the Rah@@ mi M@@ . Koç Museum in Istanbul .
four proto@@ types of this car were produced , two of which were sent to England with the reli@@ ant bad@@ ge , and two other examples , one of them white and the other one blue , were sent to Turkey with the Anad@@ ol bad@@ ge .
today , one of them is displayed at the Rah@@ mi M@@ . Koç Museum in Istanbul , since 2004 .
= = = Çağdaş = = = Dur@@ ing the late 197@@ 0s , Jan N@@ ah@@ um developed several proto@@ types and worked on new Anad@@ ol design@@ s .

G@@ and@@ hi and the entire Congress Wor@@ king Committee were arrested in B@@ om@@ bay by the British on 9 August 19@@ 42 .
G@@ and@@ hi was held for two years in the A@@ ga K@@ han Palace in Pun@@ e .
his 50 @@@ -@@ @ year old secretary Ma@@ ha@@ dev Des@@ ai died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kas@@ tur@@ ba died after 18 months ' imprisonment on 22 February 19@@ 44 ; six weeks later G@@ and@@ hi suffered a severe malar@@ ia attack .
at this point G@@ and@@ hi called off the struggle , and around 100,000 political prisoners were released , including the Congress 's leadership .
most were im@@ mer@@ sed at the San@@ g@@ am at Al@@ la@@ ha@@ bad on 12 February 19@@ 48 , but some were secre@@ tly taken away .
in 1997 , Tus@@ har G@@ and@@ hi im@@ mer@@ sed the contents of one ur@@ n , found in a bank va@@ ult and rec@@ la@@ imed through the courts , at the San@@ g@@ am at Al@@ la@@ ha@@ bad .
he tried to achieve this by learning from his own mistakes and conducting experim@@ ents on himself .
G@@ and@@ hi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own dem@@ ons , fears , and in@@ sec@@ ur@@ ities .
the concept of non@@ violence ( " ah@@ im@@ sa " ) and non@@ resistance has a long history in Indian religious thought .
later , Nav@@ aj@@ i@@ van was also published in Hin@@ di .
in addition , he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers .
this last es@@ say can be considered his programme on economics .
he also wrote exten@@ sively on veget@@ ar@@ ian@@ ism , di@@ et and health , religion , social reforms , et@@ c .
G@@ and@@ hi usually wrote in Gu@@ j@@ ar@@ ati , though he also revised the Hin@@ di and English trans@@ lations of his books .
the writ@@ ings comp@@ rise about 50,000 pages published in about a hundred vol@@ u@@ mes .
= = = followers and international influence = = = G@@ and@@ hi influenced important leaders and political movements .
leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States , including Martin Lu@@ ther King , James La@@ w@@ son , and James B@@ ev@@ el , drew from the writ@@ ings of G@@ and@@ hi in the development of their own the@@ ories about non@@ violence .
" anti @@@ -@@ @ ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id activist and former President of South Africa , Nel@@ son Man@@ de@@ la , was inspired by G@@ and@@ hi .
" G@@ and@@ hi 's life and teach@@ ings inspired many who specifically referred to G@@ and@@ hi as their ment@@ or or who dedicated their lives to spreading G@@ and@@ hi 's ideas .
in Europe , Rom@@ ain Rol@@ land was the first to discuss G@@ and@@ hi in his 19@@ 24 book " Mah@@ atma G@@ and@@ hi , " and Brazilian an@@ arch@@ ist and femin@@ ist Maria L@@ ac@@ er@@ da de M@@ our@@ a wrote about G@@ and@@ hi in her work on p@@ ac@@ if@@ ism .
in 19@@ 31 , no@@ table European physi@@ cist Albert E@@ in@@ stein ex@@ changed written letters with G@@ and@@ hi , and called him " a role model for the generations to come " in a letter writing about him .
M@@ ade@@ le@@ ine Sla@@ de ( known as " Mi@@ ra@@ be@@ hn " ) was the daughter of a British ad@@ miral who spent much of her ad@@ ult life in India as a dev@@ o@@ tee of G@@ and@@ hi .
at the Cannes Li@@ ons International Ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing Festival in 2007 , former US Vice @@@ -@@ @ President and environment@@ alist Al G@@ ore spoke of G@@ and@@ hi 's influence on him .
in hum@@ ans , for example , eye col@@ our is an inherited character@@ istic and an individual might inher@@ it the " bro@@ wn @@@ -@@ @ eye tra@@ it " from one of their parents .
the complete set of ob@@ serv@@ able tra@@ its that make up the structure and behaviour of an organ@@ ism is called its ph@@ en@@ oty@@ pe .
Her@@ itable tra@@ its are passed from one generation to the next via DNA , a mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e that en@@ co@@ des gen@@ etic information .
DNA is a long bi@@ opol@@ y@@ mer composed of four types of bases .
the sequ@@ ence of bases along a particular DNA mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e specify the gen@@ etic information , in a manner similar to a sequ@@ ence of letters sp@@ elling out a sentence .
before a cell divi@@ des , the DNA is cop@@ ied , so that each of the resulting two cells will inher@@ it the DNA sequ@@ ence .
within cells , the long str@@ ands of DNA form con@@ den@@ sed structures called ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes .
the specific location of a DNA sequ@@ ence within a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome is known as a loc@@ us .
DNA sequ@@ ences can change through mut@@ ations , producing new alle@@ les .
if a mut@@ ation occur@@ s within a gen@@ e , the new alle@@ le may affect the tra@@ it that the gen@@ e controls , alter@@ ing the ph@@ en@@ oty@@ pe of the organ@@ ism .
however , while this simple correspon@@ dence between an alle@@ le and a tra@@ it works in some cases , most tra@@ its are more complex and are controlled by quanti@@ t@@ ative tra@@ it Lo@@ ci ( multiple inter@@ acting gen@@ es ) .
recent findings have confirmed important examples of her@@ itable changes that can@@ not be explained by changes to the sequ@@ ence of n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des in the DNA .
these phenom@@ ena are class@@ ed as ep@@ ig@@ en@@ etic inher@@ it@@ ance systems .
Her@@ it@@ ability may also occur at even larger scal@@ es .
a substantial part of the vari@@ ation in ph@@ en@@ oty@@ pes in a population is caused by the differences between their gen@@ oty@@ pes .
the modern evol@@ utionary syn@@ th@@ es@@ is defin@@ es evol@@ ution as the change over time in this gen@@ etic vari@@ ation .
natural selection will only cause evol@@ ution if there is enough gen@@ etic vari@@ ation in a population .
before the discovery of Men@@ deli@@ an gen@@ e@@ tics , one common hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is was b@@ lending inher@@ it@@ ance .
despite the constant introduction of new vari@@ ation through mut@@ ation and gen@@ e flow , most of the gen@@ ome of a species is i@@ den@@ tical in all individuals of that species .
= = = mut@@ ation = = = Mut@@ ations are changes in the DNA sequ@@ ence of a cell 's gen@@ ome .
for example , the human eye uses four gen@@ es to make structures that sense light : three for col@@ our vision and one for night vision ; all four are des@@ cen@@ ded from a single an@@ ces@@ tral gen@@ e .
new gen@@ es can be generated from an an@@ ces@@ tral gen@@ e when a du@@ p@@ licate cop@@ y mut@@ ates and acqu@@ ires a new function .
the generation of new gen@@ es can also involve small parts of several gen@@ es being du@@ p@@ lic@@ ated , with these frag@@ ments then re@@ combin@@ ing to form new combin@@ ations with new functions .
sex usually increases gen@@ etic vari@@ ation and may increase the rate of evol@@ ution .
= = = Gen@@ e flow = = = Gen@@ e flow is the exchange of gen@@ es between populations and between species .
it can therefore be a source of vari@@ ation that is new to a population or to a species .
Gen@@ e transfer between species includes the formation of hy@@ bri@@ d organis@@ ms and hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal gen@@ e transfer .
in medicine , this contributes to the spread of anti@@ bio@@ tic resistance , as when one bac@@ ter@@ ia acqu@@ ires resistance gen@@ es it can rapidly transfer them to other species .
Hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal transfer of gen@@ es from bac@@ ter@@ ia to eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes such as the ye@@ ast " S@@ ac@@ char@@ om@@ y@@ ces cer@@ ev@@ is@@ i@@ a@@ e " and the ad@@ z@@ uki be@@ an we@@ ev@@ il " Cal@@ los@@ ob@@ ru@@ ch@@ us ch@@ in@@ en@@ sis " has occurred .
vir@@ uses can also carry DNA between organis@@ ms , allowing transfer of gen@@ es even across biological dom@@ ain@@ s .
it is possible that eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes themselves origin@@ ated from hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal gen@@ e trans@@ fers between bac@@ ter@@ ia and archae@@ a .
the central concept of natural selection is the evol@@ utionary f@@ it@@ ness of an organ@@ ism .
if an alle@@ le increases f@@ it@@ ness more than the other alle@@ les of that gen@@ e , then with each generation this alle@@ le will become more common within the population .
" importantly , the f@@ it@@ ness of an alle@@ le is not a fixed character@@ istic ; if the environment changes , previously neutral or harmful tra@@ its may become beneficial and previously beneficial tra@@ its become harmful .
however , even if the direction of selection does rever@@ se in this way , tra@@ its that were lost in the past may not re @@@ -@@ @ evol@@ ve in an i@@ den@@ tical form ( see Dol@@ lo 's law ) .
a special case of natural selection is sexual selection , which is selection for any tra@@ it that increases m@@ ating success by increasing the attr@@ ac@@ tiveness of an organ@@ ism to potential mates .
natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual tra@@ its , are more or less likely to survive .
" nature " in this sense ref@@ ers to an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem , that is , a system in which organis@@ ms inter@@ act with every other element , physical as well as biological , in their local environment .
" each population within an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem occup@@ ies a distinc@@ t nic@@ he , or position , with distinc@@ t relationships to other parts of the system .
these relationships involve the life history of the organ@@ ism , its position in the food chain and its geo@@ graphic range .
this broad understanding of nature enables scientists to de@@ lin@@ e@@ ate specific forces which , together , comp@@ rise natural selection .
natural selection can act at different levels of organisation , such as gen@@ es , cells , individual organis@@ ms , groups of organis@@ ms and species .
for example , according to the ph@@ en@@ oty@@ pe @@@ -@@ @ first theory of evol@@ ution , mut@@ ations can eventually cause the gen@@ etic as@@ simil@@ ation of tra@@ its that were previously indu@@ ced by the environment .
Mut@@ ations leading to the loss of function of a gen@@ e are much more common than mut@@ ations that produce a new , fully functional gen@@ e .
but when selection is weak , mut@@ ation bias towards loss of function can affect evol@@ ution .
this kind of loss of function can occur because of mut@@ ation bias , and / or because the function had a cost , and once the benefit of the function disappeared , natural selection leads to the loss .
however , the rate of re@@ combination is low ( approximately two events per ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome per generation ) .
a set of alle@@ les that is usually inherited in a group is called a ha@@ plo@@ type .
= = = Gen@@ e flow = = = Gen@@ e flow involves the exchange of gen@@ es between populations and between species .
the presence or absence of gen@@ e flow fundament@@ ally changes the course of evol@@ ution .
during the development of the modern syn@@ th@@ es@@ is , Se@@ wall W@@ right developed his shif@@ ting balance theory , which regarded gen@@ e flow between partially isolated populations as an important aspect of adap@@ tive evol@@ ution .
most prominent are the specific behavi@@ our@@ al and physical adap@@ tations that are the outcome of natural selection .
in general , mac@@ ro@@ evol@@ ution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of micro@@ evol@@ ution .
thus , the distinc@@ tion between micro@@ - and mac@@ ro@@ evol@@ ution is not a fundamental one - the difference is simply the time involved .
however , in mac@@ ro@@ evol@@ ution , the tra@@ its of the entire species may be important .
for example , the overwhel@@ ming majority of species are mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic pro@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes , which form about half the world 's bi@@ om@@ ass despite their small size , and constitute the vast majority of Earth 's bio@@ diversity .
= = = adap@@ tation = = = adap@@ tation is the process that makes organis@@ ms better su@@ ited to their ha@@ bit@@ at .
also , the term adap@@ tation may refer to a tra@@ it that is important for an organ@@ ism 's survival .
consequently , structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organis@@ ms .
this is the result of a single an@@ ces@@ tral structure being adap@@ ted to function in different ways .
during evol@@ ution , some structures may lose their original function and become v@@ esti@@ gi@@ al structures .
such structures may have little or no function in a current species , yet have a clear function in an@@ ces@@ tral species , or other closely related species .
however , many tra@@ its that appear to be simple adap@@ tations are in fact ex@@ ap@@ tations : structures originally adap@@ ted for one function , but which co@@ in@@ cid@@ ent@@ ally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process .
an area of current investigation in evol@@ utionary develop@@ mental bi@@ ology is the develop@@ mental basis of adap@@ tations and ex@@ ap@@ tations .
this research addresses the origin and evol@@ ution of em@@ br@@ yon@@ ic development and how modi@@ fic@@ ations of development and develop@@ mental processes produce novel features .
these studies have shown that evol@@ ution can al@@ ter development to produce new structures , such as em@@ br@@ yon@@ ic bone structures that develop into the j@@ a@@ w in other animals instead forming part of the middle e@@ ar in mam@@ m@@ als .
it is now becoming clear that most alter@@ ations in the form of organis@@ ms are due to changes in a small set of con@@ served gen@@ es .
for instance , an extreme co@@ operation exists between plants and the my@@ cor@@ r@@ hiz@@ al fun@@ gi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absor@@ bing nut@@ ri@@ ents from the soil .
this is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fun@@ gi with su@@ gar@@ s from pho@@ tos@@ yn@@ th@@ es@@ is .
here , the fun@@ gi actually grow inside plant cells , allowing them to exchange nut@@ ri@@ ents with their hosts , while sending signals that sup@@ press the plant im@@ mun@@ e system .
on an even smaller scale , the som@@ atic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their re@@ production so they can maintain a stable organ@@ ism , which then supports a small number of the animal 's ger@@ m cells to produce off@@ spring .
there are multiple ways to define the concept of " species .
despite the diversity of various species concep@@ ts , these various concep@@ ts can be placed into one of three broad phil@@ osoph@@ ical approaches : inter@@ bre@@ eding , ecological and phy@@ lo@@ gen@@ etic .
the biological Spec@@ ies Con@@ cep@@ t ( B@@ SC ) is a clas@@ sic example of the inter@@ bre@@ eding approach .
defined by Ern@@ st May@@ r in 19@@ 42 , the B@@ SC states that " species are groups of actually or potentially inter@@ bre@@ eding natural populations , which are re@@ produc@@ tively isolated from other such groups .
some researchers have attempted a un@@ ifying mon@@ istic defin@@ ition of species , while others adopt a plur@@ alistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to log@@ ically interpre@@ t the defin@@ ition of a species .
Gen@@ e flow may slow this process by spreading the new gen@@ etic vari@@ ants also to the other populations .
Spec@@ iation has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature .
selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organis@@ ms .
the third mechanism of speci@@ ation is par@@ ap@@ at@@ ric speci@@ ation .
this is similar to per@@ ip@@ at@@ ric speci@@ ation in that a small population enters a new ha@@ bit@@ at , but di@@ ffers in that there is no physical separation between these two populations .
generally this occur@@ s when there has been a dras@@ tic change in the environment within the par@@ ental species ' ha@@ bit@@ at .
this is not common in animals as animal hy@@ bri@@ ds are usually ster@@ ile .
an example of such a speci@@ ation event is when the plant species " Ara@@ bid@@ op@@ sis th@@ ali@@ ana " and " Ara@@ bid@@ op@@ sis aren@@ osa " cross @@@ -@@ @ b@@ red to give the new species " Ara@@ bid@@ op@@ sis su@@ ec@@ ica . "
this happened about 20,000 years ago , and the speci@@ ation process has been repeated in the laboratory , which allows the study of the gen@@ etic mechanisms involved in this process .
indeed , ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome doub@@ ling within a species may be a common cause of re@@ productive isolation , as half the doubled ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes will be un@@ mat@@ ched when bre@@ eding with und@@ oub@@ led organis@@ ms .
= = = ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion = = = ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion is the dis@@ appearance of an entire species .
nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t , and ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion appears to be the ultimate fate of all species .
present @@@ -@@ @ day ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion rates are 100 @@@ -@@ @ 1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30 % of current species may be ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t by the mid 21st century .
the role of ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion in evol@@ ution is not very well understood and may depend on which type of ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion is considered .
current species are a stage in the process of evol@@ ution , with their diversity the product of a long series of speci@@ ation and ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion events .
for example , all living cells use the same basic set of n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des and am@@ ino ac@@ ids .
the eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tic cells emerged between 1.6 @@@ -@@ @ 2.7 billion years ago .
soon after the emer@@ gence of these first mul@@ tic@@ el@@ lular organis@@ ms , a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years , in an event called the C@@ amb@@ ri@@ an explosion .
in@@ sec@@ ts were particularly successful and even today make up the majority of animal species .
artificial selection is the inten@@ tional selection of tra@@ its in a population of organis@@ ms .
this has been used for thousands of years in the dome@@ sti@@ cation of plants and animals .
understanding the changes that have occurred during an organ@@ ism 's evol@@ ution can reveal the gen@@ es needed to construct parts of the body , gen@@ es which may be involved in human gen@@ etic dis@@ orders .
in computer science , si@@ mu@@ lations of evol@@ ution using evol@@ utionary al@@ gor@@ ith@@ ms and artificial life started in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s and were extended with si@@ mu@@ lation of artificial selection .
artificial evol@@ ution became a widely recognised optimis@@ ation method as a result of the work of In@@ go Rec@@ hen@@ berg in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s .
he used evol@@ ution strategies to solve complex engineering problems .
gen@@ etic al@@ gor@@ ith@@ ms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Hol@@ land .
evol@@ utionary al@@ gor@@ ith@@ ms are now used to solve multi @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional problems more efficiently than software produced by human design@@ ers and also to optimis@@ e the design of systems .

Sol@@ ar@@ is is a Uni@@ x operating system originally developed by S@@ un Mic@@ ro@@ systems .
Or@@ acle Sol@@ ar@@ is , as it is now known , has been owned by Or@@ acle Corporation since Or@@ acle 's acquisition of S@@ un in January 2010 .
Sol@@ ar@@ is is known for its scal@@ ability , especially on S@@ PA@@ RC systems , and for origin@@ ating many innovative features such as D@@ Tr@@ ace , Z@@ F@@ S and Time S@@ lider .
histor@@ ically , Sol@@ ar@@ is was developed as pro@@ pri@@ etary software .
in June 2005 , S@@ un Mic@@ ro@@ systems released most of the co@@ de@@ base under the C@@ D@@ DL license , and founded the O@@ pen@@ Sol@@ ar@@ is open source project .
with O@@ pen@@ Sol@@ ar@@ is , S@@ un wanted to build a develop@@ er and us@@ er community around the software .
after the acquisition of S@@ un Mic@@ ro@@ systems in January 2010 , Or@@ acle decided to dis@@ continue the O@@ pen@@ Sol@@ ar@@ is distribution and the development model .
in August 2010 , Or@@ acle dis@@ continued providing public up@@ dates to the source code of the Sol@@ ar@@ is Ker@@ nel , effectively turning Sol@@ ar@@ is 11 into a closed source pro@@ pri@@ etary operating system .
however , through the Or@@ acle Technology Network ( O@@ T@@ N ) , industry partners can still gain access to the in @@@ -@@ @ development Sol@@ ar@@ is source code .
source code for the open source components of Sol@@ ar@@ is 11 is available for down@@ load from Or@@ acle .
on September 4 , 1991 , S@@ un announced that it would replace its existing B@@ SD @@@ -@@ @ der@@ ived Uni@@ x , Sun@@ OS 4 , with one based on S@@ V@@ R@@ 4 .
the justi@@ fication for this new " over@@ brand " was that it en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ed not only Sun@@ OS , but also the O@@ pen@@ Windows graphical us@@ er inter@@ face and Open Network comp@@ ut@@ ing ( O@@ N@@ C ) func@@ tionality .
for example , Sol@@ ar@@ is 2.@@ 4 incorpor@@ ated Sun@@ OS 5.@@ 4 .

Sol@@ ar@@ is has a reputation for being well @@@ -@@ @ su@@ ited to sym@@ metric multi@@ processing , supporting a large number of C@@ PU@@ s .
it has histor@@ ically been tigh@@ tly integrated with S@@ un 's S@@ PA@@ RC hard@@ w@@ are ( including support for 64 @@@ -@@ @ bit S@@ PA@@ RC applications since Sol@@ ar@@ is 7 ) , with which it is mar@@ ke@@ ted as a combined package .
this has led to more reliable systems , but at a cost premi@@ um compared to commodi@@ ty PC hard@@ w@@ are .
= = = O@@ ther plat@@ forms = = = Sol@@ ar@@ is 2.@@ 5.@@ 1 included support for the Pow@@ er@@ PC platform ( Pow@@ er@@ PC Re@@ ference Plat@@ form ) , but the port was can@@ cele@@ d before the Sol@@ ar@@ is 2.@@ 6 release .
in January 2006 a community of develop@@ ers at B@@ las@@ tw@@ ave began work on a Pow@@ er@@ PC port which they named " Pol@@ ar@@ is . "
a port of Sol@@ ar@@ is to the In@@ tel I@@ tan@@ ium architecture was announced in 1997 but never brought to market .
on October 17 , 2008 a proto@@ type release of S@@ iri@@ us was made available and on November 19 the same year , IBM author@@ ized the use of S@@ iri@@ us on System Z I@@ F@@ L proc@@ es@@ sors .
Sol@@ ar@@ is also supports the Lin@@ u@@ x platform AB@@ I , allowing Sol@@ ar@@ is to run native Lin@@ u@@ x bin@@ aries on x@@ 86 systems .
this feature is called " Sol@@ ar@@ is contain@@ ers for Lin@@ u@@ x Ap@@ p@@ lic@@ ations " or SC@@ LA , based on the bran@@ ded zones func@@ tionality introduced in Sol@@ ar@@ is 10 8 / 07 .
instal@@ lation of Sol@@ ar@@ is is not necessary for an individual to use the system .
in Sol@@ ar@@ is 2.@@ 0 to 2.2 , O@@ pen@@ Windows supported both news and X applications , and provided back@@ ward compati@@ bility for Sun@@ Vi@@ ew applications from S@@ un 's older des@@ k@@ top environment .
news allowed applications to be built in an object oriented way using P@@ ost@@ S@@ cri@@ pt , a common printing language released in 1982 .
sun later dropped support for legacy Sun@@ Vi@@ ew applications and news with O@@ pen@@ Windows 3.3 , which shi@@ pped with Sol@@ ar@@ is 2.3 , and swit@@ ched to X@@ 11@@ R@@ 5 with Dis@@ play P@@ ost@@ s@@ cri@@ pt support .
the graphical look and feel remained based upon open look .
O@@ pen@@ Windows 3.@@ 6.@@ 2 was the last release under Sol@@ ar@@ is 8 .
the open look Vir@@ tual Win@@ dow Manager ( ol@@ v@@ w@@ m ) can still be down@@ loaded for Sol@@ ar@@ is from sun@@ fre@@ e@@ w@@ are and works on rele@@ ases as recent as Sol@@ ar@@ is 10 .
sun and other Uni@@ x ven@@ d@@ ors created an industry alliance to stand@@ ar@@ di@@ ze Uni@@ x des@@ k@@ tops .
C@@ D@@ E was an initiative to create a standard Uni@@ x des@@ k@@ top environment .
C@@ D@@ E was available as an un@@ bun@@ d@@ led add @@@ -@@ @ on for Sol@@ ar@@ is 2.@@ 4 and 2.5 , and was included in Sol@@ ar@@ is 2.@@ 6 through 10 .
in 2001 , S@@ un issued a pre@@ view release of the open @@@ -@@ @ source des@@ k@@ top environment GN@@ OM@@ E 1.4 , based on the G@@ TK + to@@ ol@@ k@@ it , for Sol@@ ar@@ is 8 .
Sol@@ ar@@ is 9 8 / 03 introduced GN@@ OM@@ E 2.@@ 0 as an alternative to C@@ D@@ E .
Sol@@ ar@@ is 10 includes S@@ un 's J@@ ava des@@ k@@ top System ( J@@ DS ) , which is based on GN@@ OM@@ E and comes with a large set of applications , including Star@@ Office , S@@ un 's office su@@ ite .
sun describes J@@ DS as a " major component " of Sol@@ ar@@ is 10 .
the J@@ ava des@@ k@@ top System is not included in Sol@@ ar@@ is 11 which instead ships with a stock version of GN@@ OM@@ E .
likewise , C@@ D@@ E applications are no longer included in Sol@@ ar@@ is 11 , but many libraries remain for bin@@ ary back@@ wards compati@@ bility .
the open source des@@ k@@ top environ@@ ments KD@@ E and X@@ f@@ ce , along with numerous other window managers , also comp@@ ile and run on recent ver@@ sions of Sol@@ ar@@ is .
sun was investing in a new des@@ k@@ top environment called Project Lo@@ oking G@@ lass since 2003 .
the project has been in@@ active since late 2006 .
the license allowed the us@@ er to down@@ load the operating system free of charge , through the Or@@ acle Technology Network , and use it for a 90 @@@ -@@ @ day trial period .
after that trial period had expired the us@@ er would then have to purchase a support contract from Or@@ acle to continue using the operating system .
with the release of Sol@@ ar@@ is 11 in 2011 the license terms changed again .

this was followed by the Supreme Soviet vote declaring independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991 as the Republic of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan .
together with the representatives of seven other Repub@@ lic@@ s that same month , he signed the Treaty of the New Economic Community .
finally , on 21 December 1991 , Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan joined with the other four Central Asian Repub@@ lic@@ s to formally enter the new Com@@ mon@@ wealth of Independent States .

General rela@@ tivity , also known as the general theory of rela@@ tivity , is the geo@@ metric theory of gra@@ v@@ itation published by Albert E@@ in@@ stein in 19@@ 15 and the current descri@@ ption of gra@@ v@@ itation in modern physi@@ cs .
although general rela@@ tivity is not the only rela@@ tivis@@ tic theory of gra@@ vity , it is the simp@@ lest theory that is consistent with experim@@ ental data .
in addition , general rela@@ tivity is the basis of current cos@@ m@@ ological models of a consistently expanding uni@@ verse .
= = History = = So@@ on after publishing the special theory of rela@@ tivity in 19@@ 05 , E@@ in@@ stein started thinking about how to incorpor@@ ate gra@@ vity into his new rela@@ tivis@@ tic framework .
after numerous de@@ tour@@ s and false starts , his work culmin@@ ated in the presentation to the Pr@@ us@@ sian Academy of Science in November 19@@ 15 of what are now known as the E@@ in@@ stein field equ@@ ations .
the E@@ in@@ stein field equ@@ ations are non@@ lin@@ e@@ ar and very difficult to solve .
but as early as 19@@ 16 , the astro@@ physi@@ cist Kar@@ l Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild found the first non @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ vi@@ al exact solution to the E@@ in@@ stein field equ@@ ations , the so @@@ -@@ @ called Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild metric .
by 19@@ 29 , however , the work of H@@ ub@@ ble and others had shown that our uni@@ verse is expanding .
the preferred iner@@ tial mo@@ tions are related to the geo@@ me@@ try of space and time : in the standard reference fra@@ mes of classical mechan@@ ics , objects in free motion move along stra@@ ight lines at constant speed .
however , there is an ambi@@ gu@@ ity once gra@@ vity comes into play .
this suggests the defin@@ ition of a new class of iner@@ tial motion , name@@ ly that of objects in free fall under the influence of gra@@ vity .
however , space " time " as a whole is more complicated .
in the language of sym@@ me@@ try : where gra@@ vity can be neglec@@ ted , physi@@ cs is Lor@@ ent@@ z inv@@ ar@@ i@@ ant as in special rela@@ tivity rather than Gal@@ il@@ ei inv@@ ar@@ i@@ ant as in classical mechan@@ ics .
with Lor@@ ent@@ z sym@@ me@@ try , additional structures come into play .
they are defined by the set of light con@@ es ( see the image on the left ) .
as in the New@@ ton@@ ian case , this is sugges@@ tive of a more general geo@@ me@@ try .
= = = defin@@ ition and basic properties = = = General rela@@ tivity is a metric theory of gra@@ v@@ itation .
Par@@ ap@@ h@@ ras@@ ing the rela@@ tivis@@ t John Archi@@ bal@@ d W@@ he@@ eler , sp@@ ac@@ etime tells matter how to move ; matter tells sp@@ ac@@ etime how to cur@@ ve .
for weak gra@@ vit@@ ational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light , the theory 's predic@@ tions conver@@ ge on those of New@@ ton 's law of universal gra@@ v@@ itation .
it thus satis@@ fies a more str@@ ingent general principle of rela@@ tivity , name@@ ly that the laws of physi@@ cs are the same for all observers .
E@@ in@@ stein 's equ@@ ations are non@@ lin@@ e@@ ar partial differ@@ ential equ@@ ations and , as such , difficult to solve exactly .
nevertheless , a number of exact solutions are known , although only a few have direct physical applications .
in the field of num@@ er@@ ical rela@@ tivity , powerful computers are employed to si@@ mu@@ late the geo@@ me@@ try of sp@@ ac@@ etime and to solve E@@ in@@ stein 's equ@@ ations for interesting situations such as two col@@ li@@ ding black ho@@ les .
the latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geo@@ me@@ try of a sp@@ ac@@ etime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light .
the expansion involves a series of terms ; the first terms represent New@@ ton@@ ian gra@@ vity , whereas the later terms represent ever smaller correc@@ tions to New@@ ton 's theory due to general rela@@ tivity .
= = Con@@ sequ@@ ences of E@@ in@@ stein 's theory = = General rela@@ tivity has a number of physical consequences .
light sent down into a gra@@ vity well is blu@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ted , whereas light sent in the opposite direction ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . , clim@@ bing out of the gra@@ vity well ) is red@@ shif@@ ted ; collec@@ tively , these two effects are known as the gra@@ vit@@ ational frequ@@ ency shift .
more generally , processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place far@@ ther away ; this effect is known as gra@@ vit@@ ational time dil@@ ation .
all results are in agreement with general rela@@ tivity .
however , at the current level of accur@@ acy , these ob@@ serv@@ ations can@@ not distingu@@ ish between general rela@@ tivity and other the@@ ories in which the equi@@ val@@ ence principle is valid .
this and related predic@@ tions follow from the fact that light follows what is called a light @@@ -@@ @ like or n@@ ul@@ l Geo@@ de@@ sic - a general@@ ization of the stra@@ ight lines along which light travels in classical physi@@ cs .
as one exam@@ ines su@@ itable model sp@@ ac@@ eti@@ mes ( either the ex@@ ter@@ ior Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild solution or , for more than a single mass , the post @@@ -@@ @ New@@ ton@@ ian expansion ) , several effects of gra@@ vity on light propag@@ ation emerge .
E@@ in@@ stein first der@@ ived this result by using an approxim@@ ate metric representing the New@@ ton@@ ian limit and tre@@ ating the or@@ bi@@ ting body as a test parti@@ cle .
the effect can also be der@@ ived by using either the exact Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild metric ( describing sp@@ ac@@ etime around a sp@@ her@@ ical mass ) or the much more general post @@@ -@@ @ New@@ ton@@ ian form@@ alism .
within the So@@ lar System or for ordinary double stars , the effect is too small to be ob@@ serv@@ able .
because neut@@ ron stars are very comp@@ act , significant amounts of energy are em@@ it@@ ted in the form of gra@@ vit@@ ational radi@@ ation .
the first ob@@ servation of a decrease in or@@ bi@@ tal period due to the emis@@ sion of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves was made by H@@ ul@@ se and Tay@@ lor , using the bin@@ ary pul@@ sar P@@ SR@@ 19@@ 13 + 16 they had discovered in 1974 .
if a massive object is situated between the as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative dist@@ ances , the as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer will see multiple dist@@ or@@ ted images of the target .
such effects are known as gra@@ vit@@ ational len@@ sing .
the ear@@ li@@ est example was discovered in 1979 ; since then , more than a hundred gra@@ vit@@ ational len@@ ses have been observed .
several land @@@ -@@ @ based gra@@ vit@@ ational wave detec@@ tors are currently in operation , most notably the inter@@ fer@@ o@@ metric detec@@ tors ge@@ o 600 , L@@ IG@@ O ( two detec@@ tors ) , TA@@ MA 300 and V@@ IR@@ G@@ O .
in the currently accepted models of ste@@ l@@ lar evol@@ ution , neut@@ ron stars of around 1.4 solar mas@@ ses , and ste@@ l@@ lar black ho@@ les with a few to a few dozen solar mas@@ ses , are thought to be the final state for the evol@@ ution of massive stars .
General rela@@ tivity plays a central role in model@@ ling all these phenom@@ ena , and ob@@ serv@@ ations provide strong evidence for the existence of black ho@@ les with the properties predicted by the theory .
astronom@@ ical ob@@ serv@@ ations of the cos@@ m@@ ological expansion rate allow the total amount of matter in the uni@@ verse to be estimated , although the nature of that matter remains my@@ ster@@ ious in part .
recent meas@@ ure@@ ments of the cos@@ m@@ ic background radi@@ ation have resulted in the first evidence for this scenario .
an even larger question is the physi@@ cs of the ear@@ li@@ est uni@@ verse , prior to the inf@@ la@@ tionary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big ban@@ g sing@@ ular@@ ity .
since no object can over@@ take a light pul@@ se , all interior matter is imprisoned as well .
using global geo@@ me@@ try , later studies have revealed more general properties of black ho@@ les .
even more remar@@ kab@@ ly , there is a general set of laws known as black hol@@ e mechan@@ ics , which is anal@@ og@@ ous to the laws of ther@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics .
for instance , by the second law of black hol@@ e mechan@@ ics , the area of the event hor@@ iz@@ on of a general black hol@@ e will never decrease with time , anal@@ og@@ ous to the ent@@ rop@@ y of a ther@@ mo@@ dynamic system .
this limits the energy that can be extr@@ acted by classical means from a rotating black hol@@ e ( e@@ .@@ g@@ .
there is strong evidence that the laws of black hol@@ e mechan@@ ics are , in fact , a sub@@ set of the laws of ther@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics , and that the black hol@@ e area is propor@@ tional to its ent@@ rop@@ y .
this radi@@ ation is known as Haw@@ king radi@@ ation ( c@@ f .
there are other types of hor@@ iz@@ ons .
even in flat Min@@ ko@@ w@@ ski space , when described by an accelerated observer ( R@@ in@@ d@@ ler space ) , there will be hor@@ iz@@ ons associated with a semi @@@ -@@ @ classical radi@@ ation known as Un@@ ru@@ h radi@@ ation .
the cos@@ m@@ ic censorship hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is states that all realistic future sing@@ ular@@ ities ( no perfect sym@@ me@@ tries , matter with realistic properties ) are saf@@ ely hidden away behind a hor@@ iz@@ on , and thus in@@ visible to all distant observers .
the best @@@ -@@ @ known example is the Ad@@ m form@@ alism .
in E@@ in@@ stein 's theory , it turns out to be impossible to find a general defin@@ ition for a seem@@ ingly simple property such as a system 's total mass ( or energy ) .
the main reason is that the gra@@ vit@@ ational field - like any physical field - must be as@@ cri@@ bed a certain energy , but that it proves to be fundament@@ ally impossible to lo@@ cal@@ ize that energy .
correspon@@ ding global defin@@ itions exist for momentum and an@@ gular momentum .
the hope is to obtain a quanti@@ ty useful for general statements about isolated systems , such as a more precise formu@@ lation of the Hoop con@@ j@@ ec@@ ture .
= = relationship with qu@@ ant@@ um theory = = If general rela@@ tivity were considered to be one of the two pil@@ lars of modern physi@@ cs , then qu@@ ant@@ um theory , the basis of understanding matter from elementary parti@@ c@@ les to solid state physi@@ cs , would be the other .
however , how to reconc@@ ile qu@@ ant@@ um theory with general rela@@ tivity is still an open question .
in order to describe situations in which gra@@ vity is strong enough to influence ( qu@@ ant@@ um ) matter , yet not strong enough to require quanti@@ z@@ ation itself , physi@@ c@@ ists have formu@@ lated qu@@ ant@@ um field the@@ ories in cur@@ ved sp@@ ac@@ etime .
these the@@ ories rely on general rela@@ tivity to describe a cur@@ ved background sp@@ ac@@ etime , and define a general@@ ized qu@@ ant@@ um field theory to describe the behavi@@ or of qu@@ ant@@ um matter within that sp@@ ac@@ etime .
as brief@@ ly mentioned above , this radi@@ ation plays an important role for the ther@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics of black ho@@ les .
at low ener@@ gies , this approach proves successful , in that it results in an acceptable effective ( qu@@ ant@@ um ) field theory of gra@@ vity .
another approach starts with the can@@ on@@ ical quanti@@ z@@ ation procedures of qu@@ ant@@ um theory .
all candidate the@@ ories still have major formal and concep@@ tual problems to overcome .
= = Cur@@ rent status = = General rela@@ tivity has emerged as a highly successful model of gra@@ v@@ itation and cos@@ m@@ ology , which has so far passed many un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous ob@@ serv@@ ational and experim@@ ental tests .

Ob@@ serv@@ ational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physi@@ cs .

Pho@@ bo@@ s is one of the least reflec@@ tive bodies in the So@@ lar System , and features a large impact cra@@ ter , S@@ tic@@ k@@ ney .
on June 30 , 1945 , before EN@@ IA@@ C was made , ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian John von Ne@@ um@@ an@@ n distributed the paper entitled " First Dra@@ ft of a Report on the E@@ DV@@ A@@ C . "
significantly , the program@@ s written for E@@ DV@@ A@@ C were to be stored in high @@@ -@@ @ speed computer memory rather than specified by the physical w@@ iring of the computer .
clock signal frequ@@ encies ranging from 100 k@@ H@@ z to 4 M@@ H@@ z were very common at this time , limited largely by the speed of the swit@@ ching devices they were built with .
the first such improvement came with the adv@@ ent of the trans@@ ist@@ or .
at first only very basic non @@@ -@@ @ speci@@ al@@ ized digital cir@@ cu@@ its such as nor gates were min@@ i@@ atur@@ ized into IC@@ s .
M@@ SI and L@@ SI ( medi@@ um@@ - and large @@@ -@@ @ scale integration ) IC@@ s increased trans@@ ist@@ or counts to hundreds , and then thousands .
in 19@@ 64 , IBM introduced its System / 360 computer architecture that was used in a series of computers capable of running the same program@@ s with different speed and performance .
this was significant at a time when most electronic computers were in@@ compatible with one another , even those made by the same manufacturer .
in the same year ( 19@@ 64 ) , D@@ ig@@ ital equipment Corporation ( D@@ EC ) introduced another influential computer aimed at the scientific and research markets , the PDP @@@ -@@ @ 8 .
D@@ EC would later introduce the extremely popular PDP @@@ -@@ @ 11 line that originally was built with S@@ SI IC@@ s but was eventually implemented with L@@ SI components once these became practical .
additionally while discre@@ te trans@@ ist@@ or and IC C@@ PU@@ s were in heavy usage , new high @@@ -@@ @ performance design@@ s like S@@ IM@@ D ( Sing@@ le In@@ struction multiple D@@ ata ) v@@ ec@@ tor proc@@ es@@ sors began to appear .
micro@@ proc@@ es@@ sors , on the other hand , are C@@ PU@@ s manufac@@ tured on a very small number of IC@@ s ; usually just one .
while the complex@@ ity , size , construction , and general form of C@@ PU@@ s have changed enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly since 19@@ 50 , it is no@@ table that the basic design and function has not changed much at all .
the way in which the num@@ er@@ ical in@@ struction value is interpreted is defined by the C@@ P@@ U 's in@@ struction set architecture ( I@@ sa ) .
such oper@@ ands may be given as a constant value ( called an immediate value ) , or as a place to locate a value : a register or a memory address , as determined by some addressing mo@@ de .
the control unit does not exec@@ ute program instruc@@ tions ; rather , it direc@@ ts other parts of the system to do so .
related to num@@ er@@ ic representation is the size and prec@@ ision of in@@ te@@ ger numbers that a C@@ P@@ U can represent .
this has the advantage of simplif@@ ying the C@@ P@@ U significantly , both from a design perspective and a component @@@ -@@ @ count perspective .
for example , a clock signal is subject to the delays of any other electrical signal .
higher clock rates in increasingly complex C@@ PU@@ s make it more difficult to keep the clock signal in phase ( syn@@ chron@@ ized ) throughout the entire unit .
in general , a component that is swit@@ ching uses more energy than an element in a st@@ atic state .
another method of addressing some of the problems with a global clock signal is the removal of the clock signal altogether .
two no@@ table examples of this are the ARM comp@@ li@@ ant AM@@ U@@ L@@ ET and the MI@@ PS R@@ 3@@ 000 compatible Min@@ i@@ MI@@ PS .
= = = Par@@ alle@@ lis@@ m = = = The descri@@ ption of the basic operation of a C@@ P@@ U offered in the previous section describes the simp@@ lest form that a C@@ P@@ U can take .
this design , where@@ in the C@@ P@@ U 's exec@@ ution resources can operate on only one in@@ struction at a time , can only possibly reach " scal@@ ar " performance ( one in@@ struction per clock ) .
this is the simp@@ lest form of a techni@@ que known as in@@ struction pipel@@ ining , and is u@@ tili@@ z@@ ed in almost all modern general @@@ -@@ @ purpose C@@ PU@@ s .
the performance of the memory hi@@ er@@ archy also greatly affects proc@@ essor performance , an issue bar@@ ely considered in MI@@ PS calc@@ ulations .
I@@ de@@ ally , a dual core proc@@ essor would be nearly twice as powerful as a single core proc@@ essor .

the U@@ .S. Department of Def@@ en@@ se ( D@@ O@@ D ) developed the system , which originally used 24 satel@@ li@@ tes .
announ@@ cements from Vice President Al G@@ ore and the White House in 1998 initiated these changes .
two American physi@@ c@@ ists , William Gu@@ ier and George We@@ i@@ ff@@ en@@ b@@ ach , at Jo@@ h@@ ns H@@ op@@ kins 's Ap@@ p@@ lied P@@ hy@@ sics Lab@@ or@@ atory ( A@@ P@@ L ) , decided to monitor Sp@@ ut@@ nik 's radio trans@@ missions .
within hours they real@@ ized that , because of the D@@ op@@ pler effect , they could pin@@ point where the satellite was along its or@@ bit .
the Director of the A@@ P@@ L gave them access to their UNI@@ V@@ A@@ C to do the heavy calc@@ ulations required .
the next spring , Frank Mc@@ C@@ l@@ ure , the deputy director of the A@@ P@@ L , asked Gu@@ ier and We@@ i@@ ff@@ en@@ b@@ ach to investigate the in@@ verse problem - pin@@ pointing the us@@ er 's location given that of the satellite .
) This led them and A@@ P@@ L to develop the Tran@@ sit system .
in 19@@ 59 , AR@@ PA ( ren@@ amed D@@ AR@@ PA in 197@@ 2 ) also played a role in Tran@@ sit .
the first satellite navig@@ ation system , Tran@@ sit , used by the United States Nav@@ y , was first successfully tested in 1960 .
it used a con@@ ste@@ l@@ lation of five satel@@ li@@ tes and could provide a navig@@ ational fix approximately once per hour .
in 1967 , the U@@ .S. Nav@@ y developed the Tim@@ ation satellite that proved the ability to place accur@@ ate c@@ loc@@ ks in space , a technology required by G@@ PS .
in the 197@@ 0s , the ground @@@ -@@ @ based O@@ me@@ ga Nav@@ ig@@ ation System , based on phase comparison of signal transmission from p@@ airs of stations , became the first worldwide radio navig@@ ation system .
limit@@ ations of these systems dro@@ ve the need for a more universal navig@@ ation solution with greater accur@@ acy .
this de@@ terr@@ ent effect is why G@@ PS was funded .
considered vital to the nuclear @@@ -@@ @ de@@ terr@@ ence pos@@ ture , accur@@ ate determination of the S@@ L@@ BM launch position was a force multi@@ p@@ lier .
the USA@@ F , with two thirds of the nuclear tri@@ ad , also had requirements for a more accur@@ ate and reliable navig@@ ation system .
in 1960 , the Air Force proposed a radio @@@ -@@ @ navig@@ ation system called mos@@ a@@ ic ( mobile System for accur@@ ate IC@@ BM Control ) that was essentially a 3 @@@ -@@ @ D L@@ OR@@ AN .
in 19@@ 64 , the United States Army or@@ bi@@ ted its first Se@@ qu@@ ential Col@@ lation of Ran@@ ge ( SE@@ C@@ O@@ R ) satellite used for geo@@ de@@ tic survey@@ ing .
G@@ PS can be thought of as an evol@@ ution of the SE@@ C@@ O@@ R system where the ground @@@ -@@ @ based trans@@ mit@@ ters have been mig@@ rated into or@@ bit .
it was at this meeting that " the real syn@@ th@@ es@@ is that became G@@ PS was created .
the first satellite was launched in 1989 , and the 24th satellite was launched in 1994 .
Ro@@ ger L@@ . E@@ as@@ ton is widely credi@@ ted as the primary invent@@ or of G@@ PS .
initially , the highest quality signal was reserved for military use , and the signal available for civilian use was inten@@ tionally de@@ graded ( selec@@ tive Av@@ ail@@ ability ) .
G@@ PS is owned and operated by the United States Government as a national resource .
the Department of Def@@ en@@ se is the ste@@ ward of G@@ PS .
its membership includes equivalent @@@ -@@ @ level officials from the departments of state , commerce , and homeland security , the joint chiefs of staff , and NASA .

* In 2005 , the first moderniz@@ ed G@@ PS satellite was launched and began trans@@ mitting a second civilian signal ( L@@ 2@@ C ) for enhanced us@@ er performance .
* On May 19 , 2009 , the United States Government accountability Office issued a report warning that some G@@ PS satel@@ li@@ tes could fail as soon as 2010 .
more advanced navig@@ ation systems use additional sen@@ sors like a comp@@ ass or an iner@@ tial navig@@ ation system to comple@@ ment G@@ PS .
applications for G@@ PS such as time transfer , traffic signal timing , and syn@@ chron@@ ization of cell phone base stations , make use of this cheap and highly accur@@ ate timing .
although four satel@@ li@@ tes are required for normal operation , fewer apply in special cases .
if one vari@@ able is already known , a recei@@ ver can determine its position using only three satel@@ li@@ tes .
for example , a ship or aircraft may have known ele@@ vation .
these are the space segment ( SS ) , a control segment ( C@@ S ) , and a us@@ er segment ( US ) .
the U@@ .S. Air Force develop@@ s , maintains , and operates the space and control segments .
G@@ PS satel@@ li@@ tes broadcast signals from space , and each G@@ PS recei@@ ver uses these signals to calc@@ ulate its three @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional location ( la@@ titu@@ de , long@@ itu@@ de , and al@@ titu@@ de ) and the current time .
the space segment is composed of 24 to 32 satel@@ li@@ tes in medium ear@@ th or@@ bit and also includes the pay@@ load adap@@ ters to the boos@@ ters required to launch them into or@@ bit .
the control segment is composed of a master control station ( MC@@ S ) , an alter@@ nate master control station , and a host of dedicated and shared ground an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and monitor stations .
, there are 32 satel@@ li@@ tes in the G@@ PS con@@ ste@@ l@@ lation .

each complete message takes 750 seconds ( 12 1 / 2 minutes ) to complete .
the message structure has a basic form@@ at of a 1500 @@@ -@@ @ bit @@@ -@@ @ long frame made up of five sub@@ fra@@ mes , each sub@@ frame being 300 bi@@ ts ( 6 seconds ) long .
S@@ ub@@ fra@@ mes 4 and 5 are sub@@ comm@@ ut@@ ated 25 times each , so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full fra@@ mes .
each sub@@ frame consists of ten words , each 30 bi@@ ts long .
thus , with 300 bi@@ ts in a sub@@ frame times 5 sub@@ fra@@ mes in a frame times 25 fra@@ mes in a message , each message is 3@@ 7,@@ 500 bi@@ ts long .

before them , in 17@@ 84 , the English chem@@ ist and physi@@ cist Henry Cav@@ en@@ dish had discovered that air contains a small pro@@ portion of a sub@@ stance less reac@@ tive than nit@@ ro@@ gen .
a century later , in 18@@ 95 , Lord Ray@@ le@@ igh discovered that samples of nit@@ ro@@ gen from the air were of a different den@@ s@@ ity than nit@@ ro@@ gen resulting from chemical reactions .
with this discovery , they real@@ ized an entire class of gas@@ es was missing from the peri@@ o@@ dic table .
during his search for Arg@@ on , Ram@@ say also managed to isola@@ te hel@@ ium for the first time while heating cle@@ ve@@ ite , a mineral .
Ram@@ say continued to search for these gas@@ es using the method of frac@@ tional dis@@ til@@ lation to separate liqu@@ id air into several components .
in 18@@ 95 , French chem@@ ist Hen@@ ri Mois@@ san attempted to form a reaction between f@@ lu@@ or@@ ine , the most electron@@ eg@@ ative element , and Arg@@ on , one of the no@@ ble gas@@ es , but failed .
scientists were unable to prepare compo@@ unds of Arg@@ on until the end of the 20th century , but these attempts helped to develop new the@@ ories of at@@ om@@ ic structure .
in 19@@ 62 , Ne@@ il B@@ art@@ let@@ t discovered the first chemical compo@@ und of a no@@ ble gas , x@@ enon h@@ ex@@ af@@ lu@@ or@@ op@@ lat@@ in@@ ate .
compo@@ unds of other no@@ ble gas@@ es were discovered soon after : in 19@@ 62 for rad@@ on , rad@@ on di@@ f@@ lu@@ or@@ ide , and in 1963 for kr@@ y@@ p@@ ton , kr@@ y@@ p@@ ton di@@ f@@ lu@@ or@@ ide ( ) .
Rad@@ on has no stable iso@@ top@@ es ; its longest @@@ -@@ @ lived iso@@ top@@ e , 2@@ 2@@ 2@@ R@@ n , has a half @@@ -@@ @ life of 3.8 days and dec@@ ays to form hel@@ ium and pol@@ on@@ ium , which ultimately dec@@ ays to lead .
no@@ ble gas@@ es can@@ not accept an elec@@ tr@@ on to form stable an@@ ions ; that is , they have a negative elec@@ tr@@ on af@@ fin@@ ity .
the no@@ ble gas@@ es are nearly ideal gas@@ es under standard conditions , but their dev@@ i@@ ations from the ideal gas law provided important clu@@ es for the study of inter@@ mo@@ lec@@ ular inter@@ actions .
= = Ch@@ em@@ ical properties = = The no@@ ble gas@@ es are col@@ or@@ less , odor@@ less , tas@@ tele@@ ss , and non@@ f@@ lam@@ m@@ able under standard conditions .
= = = config@@ ur@@ ation = = = L@@ ike other groups , the members of this family show pat@@ ter@@ ns in its elec@@ tr@@ on config@@ ur@@ ation , especially the ou@@ ter@@ most shel@@ ls resulting in trends in chemical behavi@@ or : the no@@ ble gas@@ es have full val@@ ence elec@@ tr@@ on shel@@ ls .
however , he@@ avier no@@ ble gas@@ es such as rad@@ on are held less firmly together by elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force than ligh@@ ter no@@ ble gas@@ es such as hel@@ ium , making it easier to remove ou@@ ter elec@@ tr@@ ons from heavy no@@ ble gas@@ es .
to do this , the near@@ est no@@ ble gas that prece@@ des the element in question is written first , and then the elec@@ tr@@ on config@@ ur@@ ation is continued from that point forward .
= = = compo@@ unds = = = The no@@ ble gas@@ es show extremely low chemical reac@@ tivity ; consequently , only a few hundred no@@ ble gas compo@@ unds have been formed .
compo@@ unds of x@@ enon bound to bor@@ on , hydro@@ gen , bro@@ mine , i@@ od@@ ine , ber@@ yl@@ li@@ um , sul@@ ph@@ ur , ti@@ tan@@ ium , cop@@ per , and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in no@@ ble gas mat@@ ri@@ ces , or in su@@ person@@ ic no@@ ble gas j@@ ets .
however , due to the high radio@@ activity and short half @@@ -@@ @ life of rad@@ on iso@@ top@@ es , only a few f@@ lu@@ or@@ ides and ox@@ ides of rad@@ on have been formed in practice .
Kr@@ y@@ p@@ ton di@@ f@@ lu@@ or@@ ide is the most no@@ table and easily character@@ ized .
Kr@@ y@@ p@@ ton At@@ oms chem@@ ically bound to other non@@ met@@ als ( hydro@@ gen , ch@@ lor@@ ine , car@@ bon ) as well as some late transition met@@ als ( cop@@ per , silver , gold ) have also been observed , but only either at low temperatures in no@@ ble gas mat@@ ri@@ ces , or in su@@ person@@ ic no@@ ble gas j@@ ets .
similar conditions were used to obtain the first few compo@@ unds of Arg@@ on in 2000 , such as Arg@@ on f@@ lu@@ or@@ o@@ hy@@ dri@@ de ( H@@ Ar@@ F ) , and some bound to the late transition met@@ als cop@@ per , silver , and gold .
the simp@@ lest is the hel@@ ium hy@@ dri@@ de mo@@ lec@@ ular Ion , He@@ H + , discovered in 19@@ 25 .
because it is composed of the two most ab@@ und@@ ant elements in the uni@@ verse , hydro@@ gen and hel@@ ium , it is believed to occur n@@ atur@@ ally in the inter@@ ste@@ l@@ lar medium , although it has not been detec@@ ted yet .
in addition to these ions , there are many known neutral exc@@ im@@ ers of the no@@ ble gas@@ es .
the essential condition for their formation is that the guest ( no@@ ble gas ) At@@ oms must be of appropriate size to fit in the c@@ av@@ ities of the host cr@@ y@@ st@@ al lat@@ tice .
as of 2008 , en@@ do@@ h@@ edr@@ al complex@@ es with hel@@ ium , ne@@ on , Arg@@ on , kr@@ y@@ p@@ ton , and x@@ enon have been obtained .
these compo@@ unds have found use in the study of the structure and reac@@ tivity of ful@@ ler@@ en@@ es by means of the nuclear mag@@ ne@@ tic res@@ on@@ ance of the no@@ ble gas atom .
no@@ ble gas compo@@ unds such as x@@ enon di@@ f@@ lu@@ or@@ ide ( ) are considered to be hy@@ per@@ valent because they violate the oc@@ te@@ t rule .
for example , bon@@ ding in is described by a set of three mo@@ lec@@ ular or@@ bit@@ als ( M@@ Os ) der@@ ived from P @@@ -@@ @ or@@ bit@@ als on each atom .
H@@ eli@@ um is the most common element in the uni@@ verse after hydro@@ gen , with a mass frac@@ tion of about 24 % .
the reason is that there is no pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al hel@@ ium in the atmosphere ; due to the small mass of the atom , hel@@ ium can@@ not be re@@ tained by the Earth 's gra@@ vit@@ ational field .
H@@ eli@@ um on Earth comes from the Alpha dec@@ ay of heavy elements such as uranium and th@@ ori@@ um found in the Earth 's cr@@ ust , and ten@@ ds to acc@@ um@@ ulate in natural gas deposits .
due to its high radio@@ activity , rad@@ on presents a significant health haz@@ ard ; it is implic@@ ated in an estimated 2@@ 1,000 lun@@ g cancer deaths per year in the United States alone .
as an example , the table to the right lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas .
liqu@@ id ne@@ on , although it does not reach temperatures as low as liqu@@ id hel@@ ium , also finds use in cr@@ yo@@ gen@@ ics because it has over 40 times more ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ating capacity than liqu@@ id hel@@ ium and over three times more than liqu@@ id hydro@@ gen .
H@@ eli@@ um is used as a component of bre@@ a@@ thing gas@@ es to replace nit@@ ro@@ gen , due its low sol@@ u@@ bility in f@@ lu@@ ids , especially in li@@ pi@@ ds .
gas@@ es are absor@@ bed by the blood and body tis@@ sues when under pressure like in sc@@ ub@@ a di@@ ving , which causes an an@@ es@@ thetic effect known as nit@@ ro@@ gen nar@@ cos@@ is .
another no@@ ble gas , Arg@@ on , is considered the best option for use as a dr@@ y@@ suit inflation gas for sc@@ ub@@ a di@@ ving .
H@@ eli@@ um is used as the carrier medium in gas ch@@ ro@@ mat@@ o@@ graphy , as a fil@@ ler gas for ther@@ mo@@ meters , and in devices for measuring radi@@ ation , such as the Ge@@ ig@@ er counter and the bu@@ b@@ ble chamber .
Arg@@ on , mixed with nit@@ ro@@ gen , is used as a fil@@ ler gas for inc@@ an@@ des@@ cent light bul@@ bs .
the exc@@ im@@ ers used for las@@ ers may be no@@ ble gas di@@ mers such as Ar@@ 2 , Kr@@ 2 or X@@ e@@ 2 , or more com@@ mon@@ ly , the no@@ ble gas is combined with a hal@@ og@@ en in exc@@ im@@ ers such as Ar@@ F , Kr@@ F , X@@ e@@ F , or X@@ e@@ C@@ l .
these las@@ ers produce ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let light which , due to its short w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th ( 19@@ 3 N@@ M for Ar@@ F and 2@@ 48 N@@ M for Kr@@ F ) , allows for high @@@ -@@ @ prec@@ ision im@@ aging .
they are used for mic@@ rol@@ ith@@ o@@ graphy and micro@@ fabri@@ cation , which are essential for integrated cir@@ cu@@ it manufac@@ ture , and for las@@ er surgery , including las@@ er an@@ gi@@ op@@ las@@ ty and eye surgery .

the " DI@@ X @@@ -@@ @ group " with G@@ ary Rob@@ in@@ son ( D@@ EC ) , P@@ hil Ar@@ st ( In@@ tel ) , and Bo@@ b Pr@@ in@@ tis ( X@@ ero@@ x ) submitted the so @@@ -@@ @ called " Blue Book " C@@ SM@@ A / CD specif@@ ic@@ ation as a candidate for the L@@ AN specif@@ ic@@ ation .

since all communications happen on the same w@@ ire , any information sent by one computer is received by all , even if that information is intended for just one destination .
every p@@ ac@@ ket is sent to every port on the repe@@ ater , so b@@ and@@ w@@ id@@ th and security problems are not addressed .
the total throug@@ h@@ put of the repe@@ ater is limited to that of a single link , and all links must operate at the same speed .
this created practical limits on how many machines could communicate on an E@@ ther@@ net network .
broadcast traffic is still forwarded to all network segments .

upon ex@@ iting he had formu@@ lated analy@@ tical geo@@ me@@ try and the idea of applying the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal method to philosophy .
Des@@ car@@ tes also saw very clearly that all tru@@ ths were linked with one another , so that finding a fundamental truth and proce@@ eding with lo@@ gic would open the way to all science .
Des@@ car@@ tes was present at the siege of La Ro@@ ch@@ elle by Card@@ inal Ric@@ hel@@ i@@ e@@ u in 16@@ 27 .
Card@@ inal B@@ é@@ rul@@ le urged him to write an ex@@ position of his own new philosophy .
the next year , under the name " Po@@ ite@@ v@@ in , " he enrol@@ led at the Le@@ iden University to study ma@@ them@@ atics with Jac@@ o@@ b Gol@@ i@@ us , who confron@@ ted him with Pap@@ p@@ us 's h@@ ex@@ agon the@@ o@@ rem , and astr@@ onomy with Martin Hor@@ ten@@ si@@ us .
in Am@@ sterdam , he had a relationship with a ser@@ vant girl , H@@ elena J@@ ans van der St@@ rom , with whom he had a daughter , Fran@@ cine , who was born in 16@@ 35 in Dev@@ enter , at which time Des@@ car@@ tes ta@@ ught at the U@@ tre@@ cht University .
despite frequent moves he wrote all his major work during his 20 + years in the Netherlands , where he managed to revol@@ u@@ tion@@ ize ma@@ them@@ atics and philosophy .
a French trans@@ lation of " Pr@@ in@@ cip@@ ia Phil@@ os@@ op@@ hi@@ æ , " prepared by Ab@@ bot Claude Pic@@ ot , was published in 16@@ 47 .
this edition Des@@ car@@ tes dedicated to Pr@@ inc@@ ess E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth of Bo@@ hem@@ ia .
" however , in his own era , Des@@ car@@ tes was accused of har@@ bor@@ ing secret de@@ ist or a@@ the@@ ist beli@@ efs .
initially , Des@@ car@@ tes arrives at only a single principle : thought exists .
he considers a piece of wa@@ x ; his sen@@ ses inform him that it has certain character@@ isti@@ cs , such as shape , tex@@ ture , size , col@@ or , s@@ me@@ ll , and so forth .

in 16@@ 84 he married Judi@@ th Stu@@ pan@@ us ; and they had two children .
during this decade , he also began a fer@@ tile research career .

Constan@@ ti@@ j@@ n H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s was a diplomat and advis@@ or to the House of O@@ range , and also a poet and musician .
Fr@@ ans van Sch@@ oo@@ ten was an academic at Le@@ iden from 16@@ 46 , and also a private tut@@ or to H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s and his el@@ der brother , replacing St@@ amp@@ i@@ o@@ en on the advice of Des@@ car@@ tes .
after two years , from March 16@@ 47 , H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s continued his studies at the newly founded College of O@@ range , in Bre@@ da , where his father was a cur@@ ator : the change occurred because of a du@@ el between his brother Lo@@ de@@ wi@@ j@@ k and another student .
Christi@@ a@@ an H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s lived at the home of the jur@@ ist Johan@@ n Hen@@ ry@@ k D@@ au@@ ber , and had ma@@ them@@ atics classes with the English lec@@ turer John P@@ ell .
while his father had w@@ ished Christi@@ a@@ an to be a diplomat , it also was not to be .
in political terms , the First Stad@@ th@@ ol@@ der@@ less Per@@ i@@ od that began in 16@@ 50 meant that the House of O@@ range was not in power , removing Constan@@ ti@@ j@@ n H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s 's influence .
while still a colle@@ ge student at Le@@ iden he began a correspon@@ dence with the intel@@ li@@ gen@@ cer Mer@@ sen@@ ne , who died quite soon afterwards in 16@@ 48 .
Mer@@ sen@@ ne had also written on musical theory .
in 16@@ 54 , H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s returned to his father 's house in The Hague , and was able to dev@@ o@@ te himself entirely to research .
the family had another house , not far away at H@@ of@@ wi@@ j@@ ck , and he spent time there during the summer .
visiting Paris in 16@@ 55 , H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s called on Is@@ ma@@ el Bo@@ ul@@ li@@ au to introduce himself .
he began gr@@ in@@ ding his own len@@ ses in 16@@ 55 , collabor@@ ating with his brother Constan@@ ti@@ j@@ n .

Ni@@ els Hen@@ rik David Bo@@ h@@ r ( ; 7 October 18@@ 85 - 18 November 19@@ 62 ) was a Danish physi@@ cist who made found@@ ational contributions to understanding at@@ om@@ ic structure and qu@@ ant@@ um theory , for which he received the Nobel Prize in P@@ hy@@ sics in 19@@ 22 .
although the Bo@@ h@@ r model has been sup@@ plan@@ ted by other models , its under@@ lying principles remain valid .
he conce@@ ived the principle of comple@@ men@@ tar@@ ity : that items could be separately analy@@ sed in terms of contra@@ dic@@ tory properties , like be@@ having as a wave or a stream of parti@@ c@@ les .
Bo@@ h@@ r founded the Institute of the@@ ore@@ tical P@@ hy@@ sics at the University of Copenhagen , now known as the Ni@@ els Bo@@ h@@ r Institute , which opened in 19@@ 20 .
Bo@@ h@@ r men@@ to@@ red and collabor@@ ated with physi@@ c@@ ists including Hans Kr@@ am@@ ers , Os@@ kar Kle@@ in , George de H@@ ev@@ es@@ y and W@@ er@@ ner He@@ is@@ en@@ berg .
he predicted the existence of a new zir@@ con@@ ium @@@ -@@ @ like element , which was named haf@@ ni@@ um , after the Latin name for Copenhagen , where it was discovered .
from there , he was flo@@ wn to Britain , where he joined the British Tube Al@@ lo@@ ys nuclear weapons project , and was part of the British mission to the Man@@ hat@@ tan Project .
after the war , Bo@@ h@@ r called for international co@@ operation on nuclear energy .
he was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Est@@ ab@@ lis@@ hment Ris@@ ø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission , and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for the@@ ore@@ tical P@@ hy@@ sics in 19@@ 57 .
he had an el@@ der sister , J@@ en@@ ny , and a younger brother Har@@ ald .
J@@ en@@ ny became a teacher , while Har@@ ald became a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian and Olympic foot@@ bal@@ ler who played for the Danish national team at the 19@@ 08 Summer Olympics in London .
Ni@@ els was a pas@@ sion@@ ate foot@@ bal@@ ler as well , and the two brothers played several matches for the Copenhagen @@@ -@@ @ based Akademis@@ k Bol@@ d@@ k@@ lub ( Acade@@ m@@ ic Football Club ) , with Ni@@ els as goal@@ keep@@ er .
his major was physi@@ cs , which he studied under Professor Christian Christi@@ ans@@ en , the university 's only professor of physi@@ cs at that time .
he also studied astr@@ onomy and ma@@ them@@ atics under Professor Th@@ or@@ val@@ d T@@ hi@@ ele , and philosophy under Professor Har@@ ald H@@ ø@@ ff@@ ding , a friend of his father .
Bo@@ h@@ r conducted a series of experim@@ ents using his father 's laboratory in the university ; the university itself had no physi@@ cs laboratory .
he later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the " Phil@@ osoph@@ ical Trans@@ actions of the Royal Society . "
he surveyed the literature on the subject , settling on a model pos@@ tu@@ lated by Paul Dru@@ de and elabor@@ ated by H@@ end@@ rik Lor@@ ent@@ z , in which the elec@@ tr@@ ons in a metal are considered to be@@ have like a gas .
Bo@@ h@@ r extended Lor@@ ent@@ z 's model , but was still unable to account for phenom@@ ena like the Hall effect , and concluded that elec@@ tr@@ on theory could not fully explain the mag@@ ne@@ tic properties of met@@ als .
the th@@ es@@ is was accepted in April 19@@ 11 , and Bo@@ h@@ r conducted his formal defence on 13 May .
Har@@ ald had received his doc@@ torate the previous year .
in 19@@ 21 , the Dutch physi@@ cist H@@ end@@ ri@@ ka Johan@@ na van Le@@ eu@@ w@@ en would independently der@@ ive a the@@ o@@ rem from Bo@@ h@@ r 's th@@ es@@ is that is today known as the Bo@@ h@@ r @@@ -@@ @ van Le@@ eu@@ w@@ en the@@ o@@ rem .
in 19@@ 10 , Bo@@ h@@ r met Mar@@ gre@@ the N@@ ø@@ r@@ l@@ und , the sister of the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian Ni@@ els Eri@@ k N@@ ø@@ r@@ l@@ und .
Ni@@ els and Mar@@ gre@@ the had six sons .
the oldest , Christian , died in a bo@@ ating accident in 19@@ 34 , and another , Har@@ ald , died from ch@@ ild@@ hood men@@ ing@@ itis .
A@@ age Bo@@ h@@ r became a successful physi@@ cist , and in 19@@ 75 was awarded the Nobel Prize in physi@@ cs , like his father .
Hans Hen@@ rik became a physi@@ cian ; Eri@@ k , a chemical engine@@ er ; and Ern@@ est , a lawyer .
like his un@@ cle Har@@ ald , Ern@@ est Bo@@ h@@ r became an Olympic athlete , playing field ho@@ c@@ key for Denmark at the 19@@ 48 Summer Olympics in London .
at the time , it was where most of the the@@ ore@@ tical work on the structure of At@@ oms and mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les was being done .
Bo@@ h@@ r returned to Denmark in July 19@@ 12 for his w@@ edding , and travelled around England and Scot@@ land on his hon@@ ey@@ moon .
Martin K@@ n@@ u@@ d@@ sen put Bo@@ h@@ r 's name forward for a " do@@ cent , " which was approved in July 19@@ 13 , and Bo@@ h@@ r then began teaching medical students .
he adap@@ ted Ru@@ ther@@ ford 's nuclear structure to Ma@@ x Plan@@ ck 's qu@@ ant@@ um theory and so created his Bo@@ h@@ r model of the atom .
Plan@@ etary models of At@@ oms were not new , but Bo@@ h@@ r 's treatment was .
this became a basis for what is now known as the old qu@@ ant@@ um theory .
Bal@@ mer 's formula was cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by the discovery of additional spec@@ tral lines , but for thirty years , no one could explain why it worked .
when challenged on this by Alfred Fo@@ w@@ ler , Bo@@ h@@ r rep@@ lied that they were caused by ion@@ ised hel@@ ium , hel@@ ium At@@ oms with only one elec@@ tr@@ on .
today , the Bo@@ h@@ r model of the atom has been super@@ se@@ ded , but is still the best known model of the atom , as it often appears in high school physi@@ cs and chem@@ istry tex@@ ts .
he took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen , which he started by taking a holiday in T@@ y@@ rol with his brother Har@@ ald and a@@ un@@ t Han@@ na Ad@@ ler .
they stayed until July 19@@ 16 , by which time he had been appointed to the Cha@@ ir of the@@ ore@@ tical P@@ hy@@ sics at the University of Copenhagen , a position created especially for him .
= = = Institute of P@@ hy@@ sics = = = In April 19@@ 17 , Bo@@ h@@ r began a campaign to establish an Institute of the@@ ore@@ tical P@@ hy@@ sics .
he gained the support of the Danish government and the Car@@ l@@ s@@ berg Foundation , and siz@@ eable contributions were also made by industry and private donors , many of them Jewish .
now known as the Ni@@ els Bo@@ h@@ r Institute , it opened its doors on 3 March 19@@ 21 with Bo@@ h@@ r as its director .
his family moved into an apartment on the first floor .
early arri@@ vals included Hans Kr@@ am@@ ers from the Netherlands , Os@@ kar Kle@@ in from Sweden , George de H@@ ev@@ es@@ y from Hungary , W@@ oj@@ ci@@ ech R@@ ub@@ in@@ ow@@ ic@@ z from Poland and S@@ ve@@ in Ros@@ sel@@ and from Norway .
the Bo@@ h@@ r model worked well for hydro@@ gen , but could not explain more complex elements .
an important development came in 19@@ 24 with Wolfgang Pa@@ uli 's discovery of the Pa@@ uli exclu@@ sion principle , which put Bo@@ h@@ r 's models on a firm the@@ ore@@ tical fo@@ oting .
at the Institute in Copenhagen , D@@ ir@@ k Cos@@ ter and George de H@@ ev@@ es@@ y took up the challenge of proving Bo@@ h@@ r right and Ur@@ b@@ ain wrong .
in 19@@ 22 , Bo@@ h@@ r was awarded the Nobel Prize in P@@ hy@@ sics " for his services in the investigation of the structure of At@@ oms and of the radi@@ ation em@@ an@@ ating from them . "
this states that the behaviour of systems described by qu@@ ant@@ um theory re@@ produces classical physi@@ cs in the limit of large qu@@ ant@@ um numbers .
they led to the development of mat@@ ri@@ x mechan@@ ics , the first form of modern qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
the B@@ K@@ S theory also generated discussion of , and renewed attention to , difficulties in the foundations of the old qu@@ ant@@ um theory .
in the light of these results , Bo@@ h@@ r informed Dar@@ win , " there is nothing else to do than to give our revol@@ utionary efforts as honour@@ able a funeral as possible .
" = = = qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics = = = The introduction of sp@@ in by George U@@ h@@ len@@ bec@@ k and Samuel G@@ ou@@ d@@ sm@@ it in November 19@@ 25 was a milestone .
when his train stopped in H@@ amb@@ urg , he was met by Wolfgang Pa@@ uli and O@@ tto S@@ tern , who asked for his opinion of the sp@@ in theory .
Bo@@ h@@ r pointed out that he had concerns about the inter@@ action between elec@@ tr@@ ons and mag@@ ne@@ tic fields .
when he arrived in Le@@ iden , Paul E@@ h@@ ren@@ fest and Albert E@@ in@@ stein informed Bo@@ h@@ r that E@@ in@@ stein had resolved this problem using rela@@ tivity .
Bo@@ h@@ r then had U@@ h@@ len@@ bec@@ k and G@@ ou@@ d@@ sm@@ it incorpor@@ ate this into their paper .
thus , when he met W@@ er@@ ner He@@ is@@ en@@ berg and Pas@@ c@@ ual Jordan in Gö@@ tt@@ ing@@ en on the way back , he had become , in his own words , " a pro@@ phe@@ t of the elec@@ tr@@ on mag@@ net g@@ os@@ p@@ el . "
this work attracted the attention of the British physi@@ cist Paul Di@@ rac , who came to Copenhagen for six months in September 19@@ 26 .
Austrian physi@@ cist Er@@ win Sch@@ rö@@ d@@ inger also visited in 19@@ 26 .
he conce@@ ived the phil@@ osoph@@ ical principle of comple@@ men@@ tar@@ ity : that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties , such as being a wave or a stream of parti@@ c@@ les , depending on the experim@@ ental framework .
he felt that that it was not fully understood by professional phil@@ osoph@@ ers .
in Copenhagen in 19@@ 27 He@@ is@@ en@@ berg developed his uncertainty principle , which Bo@@ h@@ r embrac@@ ed .
in a paper he presented at the Vol@@ ta Conference at Com@@ o in September 19@@ 27 , he demonstrated that the uncertainty principle could be der@@ ived from classical arguments , without qu@@ ant@@ um termin@@ ology or mat@@ ri@@ ces .
E@@ in@@ stein preferred the determin@@ ism of classical physi@@ cs over the prob@@ abil@@ istic new qu@@ ant@@ um physi@@ cs to which he himself had contributed .
phil@@ osoph@@ ical issues that ar@@ ose from the novel aspects of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion .
E@@ in@@ stein and Bo@@ h@@ r had good @@@ -@@ @ n@@ atured arguments over such issues throughout their lives .
Har@@ ald H@@ ø@@ ff@@ ding had been the first occup@@ ant , and upon his death in July 19@@ 31 , the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Let@@ ters gave Bo@@ h@@ r occup@@ ancy .
he and his family moved there in 19@@ 32 .
he was elected president of the Academy on 17 March 19@@ 39 .
this prompted Bo@@ h@@ r to create a new theory of the compo@@ und n@@ uc@@ le@@ us in 19@@ 36 , which explained how neutr@@ ons could be captured by the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us .
in this model , the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us could be de@@ formed like a drop of liqu@@ id .
he worked on this with a new collabor@@ ator , the Danish physi@@ cist Fr@@ itz Kal@@ ck@@ ar , who died su@@ d@@ den@@ ly in 19@@ 38 .
the discovery of nuclear fis@@ sion by O@@ tto H@@ ah@@ n in December 19@@ 38 ( and its the@@ ore@@ tical explanation by L@@ ise Me@@ it@@ ner ) generated intense interest among physi@@ c@@ ists .
Bo@@ h@@ r brought the news to the United States where he opened the F@@ if@@ th Washington Conference on the@@ ore@@ tical P@@ hy@@ sics with Fer@@ mi on 26 January 19@@ 39 .
Bo@@ h@@ r thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to Pla@@ c@@ z@@ ek , L@@ é@@ on Ros@@ en@@ feld and John W@@ he@@ eler that " I have understood everything .
" based on his liqu@@ id drop model of the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us , Bo@@ h@@ r concluded that it was the uranium @@@ -@@ @ 2@@ 35 iso@@ top@@ e and not the more ab@@ und@@ ant uranium @@@ -@@ @ 2@@ 38 that was primarily responsible for fis@@ sion .
in April 19@@ 40 , John R@@ . Dun@@ ning demonstrated that Bo@@ h@@ r was correct .
in the meantime , Bo@@ h@@ r and W@@ he@@ eler developed a the@@ ore@@ tical treatment which they published in a September 19@@ 39 paper on " The Mec@@ han@@ ism of Nuclear Fis@@ sion . "
Richard R@@ ho@@ des argued in " The Mak@@ ing of the Atomic bomb " that Bo@@ h@@ r was influenced by Ki@@ er@@ ke@@ ga@@ ard through H@@ ø@@ ff@@ ding .

Bo@@ h@@ r designed his own co@@ at of arms which featured a ta@@ ij@@ it@@ u ( symbol of y@@ in and Yan@@ g ) and a motto in , " oppos@@ ites are comple@@ mentary . "
the Second World War demonstrated that science , and physi@@ cs in particular , now required considerable financial and material resources .
Bo@@ h@@ r and Kr@@ am@@ ers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site .
after a long debate , Bo@@ h@@ r pledged his support to CERN in February 19@@ 52 , and Geneva was chosen as the site in October .
the CERN The@@ ory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 19@@ 57 .

the ko@@ ala is classified with w@@ om@@ b@@ ats ( family V@@ om@@ b@@ ati@@ da@@ e ) and several ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t families ( including mar@@ sup@@ ial tap@@ ir@@ s , mar@@ sup@@ ial li@@ ons and giant w@@ om@@ b@@ ats ) in the su@@ border V@@ om@@ b@@ ati@@ for@@ mes within the order Di@@ proto@@ don@@ tia .
the modern ko@@ ala is the only ex@@ tant member of P@@ has@@ col@@ ar@@ c@@ ti@@ da@@ e , a family that once included several Gener@@ a and species .
" P@@ has@@ col@@ ar@@ c@@ tos cin@@ er@@ e@@ us " may have emerged as a d@@ war@@ f form of the giant ko@@ ala ( " P@@ . s@@ tir@@ ton@@ i " ) .
these forms are distinguished by pe@@ la@@ ge col@@ our and th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness , body size and s@@ kul@@ l shape .
the Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land ko@@ ala is the smal@@ lest of the three , with shorter , silver f@@ ur and a shorter s@@ kul@@ l .
other studies have found that ko@@ ala populations have high levels of in@@ bre@@ eding and low gen@@ etic vari@@ ation .
such low gen@@ etic diversity may have been a character@@ istic of ko@@ ala populations since the late P@@ le@@ ist@@ o@@ cen@@ e .
rivers and roads have been shown to limit gen@@ e flow and contribute to the gen@@ etic differ@@ enti@@ ation of southeast Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land populations .

the animal has a st@@ ur@@ dy skeleton and a short , mus@@ cular up@@ per body with propor@@ tion@@ ately long up@@ per lim@@ bs that contribute to its clim@@ bing and gr@@ as@@ ping abilities .
the ko@@ ala 's small brain size may be an adap@@ tation to the energy restrictions imposed by its di@@ et , which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain .
for example , when presented with p@@ lu@@ cked leaves on a flat sur@@ face , the animal can@@ not adap@@ t to the change in its normal fe@@ eding rout@@ ine and will not eat the leaves .
its n@@ ose is fairly large and covered in le@@ a@@ ther@@ y s@@ kin .
the ko@@ ala has several adap@@ tations for its e@@ uc@@ aly@@ pt di@@ et , which is of low nut@@ ri@@ tive value , of high to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity and high in di@@ etary fi@@ bre .
since the ko@@ ala gains a low amount of energy from its di@@ et , its Met@@ abol@@ ic rate is half that of a typical mam@@ mal , although this can v@@ ary between se@@ as@@ ons and sex@@ es .
the ko@@ ala was introduced near A@@ de@@ la@@ ide and on several islands , including Kan@@ gar@@ oo Island and French Island .
the population on Mag@@ ne@@ tic Island represents the northern limit of its range .
they were likely driven to ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion in these areas by environmental changes and hun@@ ting by indi@@ gen@@ ous Austral@@ ians .

in New South Wal@@ es , they are ab@@ und@@ ant only in P@@ illi@@ ga , while in Victoria they are common nearly everywhere .
they tend to choose species that have a high prote@@ in content and low propor@@ tions of fi@@ bre and lig@@ nin .
the most favoured species are " E@@ uc@@ aly@@ p@@ tus micro@@ cor@@ ys , " " E@@ . ter@@ e@@ ticor@@ nis , " and " E@@ . cam@@ al@@ dul@@ en@@ sis , " which , on average , make up more than 20 percent of their di@@ et .
because they get so little energy from their di@@ et , ko@@ al@@ as must limit their energy use and sle@@ ep 20 hours a day ; only 4 hours a day are spent in active movement .
they typically eat and sle@@ ep in the same tree , possibly for as long as a day .
= = = Social sp@@ ac@@ ing = = = Ko@@ al@@ as are as@@ o@@ cial animals and spend just 15 minutes a day on social behavi@@ ours .
in Victoria , home ran@@ ges are small and have extensive over@@ la@@ p , while in central Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land they are larger and over@@ la@@ p less .
the ko@@ ala has one of the lowest milk energy production rates in relation to body size of any mam@@ mal .
the female makes up for this by la@@ c@@ t@@ ating for as long as 12 months .
at 26 weeks , the fully fur@@ red animal res@@ em@@ bles an ad@@ ult , and begins to p@@ oke its head out of the p@@ ou@@ ch .
fem@@ al@@ es become sex@@ ually mature at about three years of age and can then become pregn@@ ant ; in comparison , mal@@ es reach sexual maturity when they are about four years old , although they can produce sp@@ er@@ m as early as two years .
eventually , the cus@@ ps will dis@@ appear completely and the animal will die of star@@ vation .
these include the tap@@ e@@ wor@@ m " Ber@@ ti@@ ella ob@@ esa , " com@@ mon@@ ly found in the in@@ test@@ ine , and the n@@ emato@@ des " Mar@@ su@@ pos@@ tron@@ gy@@ lus lon@@ gil@@ ar@@ vat@@ us " and " Dur@@ ik@@ ain@@ ema phas@@ col@@ ar@@ c@@ ti , " which are inf@@ requ@@ ently found in the lun@@ gs .
the ko@@ ala retro@@ virus ( Ko@@ R@@ V ) may cause ko@@ ala im@@ mun@@ e defic@@ i@@ ency syn@@ dro@@ me ( kids ) , which is similar to AIDS in hum@@ ans .
consequently , the ko@@ ala is vulnerable to the effects of climate change .
= = Human relations = = = = = History = = = The first written reference of the ko@@ ala was recorded by John Pri@@ ce , ser@@ vant of John hun@@ ter , the Governor of New South Wal@@ es .
Bar@@ ral@@ lier preserved the ap@@ pen@@ da@@ ges and sent them and his notes to hun@@ ter 's successor , Philip G@@ id@@ ley King , who forwarded them to Joseph Ban@@ ks .
Bo@@ tan@@ ist Robert Brown was the first to write a detailed scientific descri@@ ption of the ko@@ ala in 18@@ 14 , based on a female speci@@ men captured near what is now Mount Kem@@ b@@ la in the Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra region of New South Wal@@ es .
Austrian bo@@ tan@@ ical illu@@ str@@ ator Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ au@@ er drew the animal 's s@@ kul@@ l , thro@@ at , feet and pa@@ ws .
home , who in 18@@ 08 published his report in the journ@@ al " Phil@@ osoph@@ ical Trans@@ actions of the Royal Society , " gave the animal the scientific name " Di@@ del@@ p@@ his co@@ ola . "
compar@@ ative an@@ at@@ om@@ ist Richard O@@ w@@ en , in a series of public@@ ations on the physi@@ ology and an@@ at@@ om@@ y of Australian mam@@ m@@ als , presented a paper on the an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the ko@@ ala to the Zo@@ ological Society of London .
English n@@ atur@@ alist George Robert W@@ ater@@ house , cur@@ ator of the Zo@@ ological Society of London , was the first to correc@@ tly clas@@ si@@ fy the ko@@ ala as a mar@@ sup@@ ial in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s .

it benef@@ ited the Australian tourism industry by over an estimated billion dollars in 1998 , a figure that has since grown .
in one , a kan@@ gar@@ oo cuts it off to punish the ko@@ ala for being la@@ zy and gre@@ edy .
tri@@ bes in both Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land and Victoria regarded the ko@@ ala as a wise animal and sought its advice .
the animal is also depic@@ ted in rock car@@ v@@ ings , though not as much as some other species .
it is featured in E@@ the@@ l P@@ ed@@ ley 's 18@@ 99 book " do@@ t and the Kan@@ gar@@ oo , " in which it is por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed as the " fun@@ ny native bear . "
this character also appeared as Bun@@ yip Blu@@ e@@ gu@@ m in Lin@@ d@@ say 's 19@@ 18 book " The Mag@@ ic Pu@@ d@@ ding . "
created by Dor@@ o@@ thy Wall in 19@@ 33 , the character appeared in several books and has been the subject of films , TV series , mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise and a 1986 environmental song by John Williamson .
the series has been ranked among the greatest commer@@ ci@@ als of all time .

in 2012 , the Australian Government listed ko@@ ala populations in Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land and New South Wal@@ es as vulnerable , because of a 40 % population decline in the former and a 33 % decline in the latter .
according to the customs of some tri@@ bes , it was considered tab@@ oo to s@@ kin the animal , while other tri@@ bes thought the animal 's head had a special status , and sav@@ ed them for bur@@ ial .
extensive cul@@ lings occurred in Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land in 19@@ 15 , 19@@ 17 , and again in 19@@ 19 , when over one million ko@@ al@@ as were killed with guns , po@@ is@@ ons and no@@ os@@ es .
the first successful efforts at con@@ serving the species were initiated by the establishment of Br@@ is@@ ban@@ e 's l@@ one p@@ ine Ko@@ ala sanc@@ tu@@ ary and Sydney 's Ko@@ ala Park sanc@@ tu@@ ary in the 19@@ 20@@ s and 19@@ 30@@ s .
in 19@@ 34 , David F@@ le@@ ay , cur@@ ator of Australian mam@@ m@@ als at the Melbourne Zo@@ o , established the first Australian fa@@ un@@ al en@@ closure at an Australian z@@ oo , and featured the ko@@ ala .
F@@ le@@ ay later continued his conserv@@ ation efforts at He@@ al@@ es@@ vil@@ le sanc@@ tu@@ ary and the David F@@ le@@ ay W@@ ild@@ life Park .

he is often called England 's national poet and the " Bar@@ d of Av@@ on . "
S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are was born and brought up in Str@@ at@@ ford @@@ -@@ @ upon @@@ -@@ @ Av@@ on .
at the age of 18 , he married Anne H@@ ath@@ away , with whom he had three children : Sus@@ anna , and tw@@ ins Ham@@ net and Judi@@ th .
S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are produced most of his known work between 15@@ 89 and 16@@ 13 .
in his last phase , he wrote trag@@ ic@@ o@@ medi@@ es , also known as roman@@ ces , and collabor@@ ated with other play@@ w@@ rights .
his plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied , performed , and re@@ interpreted in di@@ verse cultural and political con@@ tex@@ ts throughout the world .
he was the third child of eight and the el@@ dest survi@@ ving son .
at the age of 18 , S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are married the 26 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Anne H@@ ath@@ away .
the consist@@ ory court of the Di@@ oc@@ ese of Wor@@ ces@@ ter issued a marriage licence on 27 November 15@@ 82 .
tw@@ ins , son Ham@@ net and daughter Judi@@ th , followed almost two years later and were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ sed 2 February 15@@ 85 .
Ham@@ net died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 15@@ 96 .
= = = London and theat@@ ri@@ cal career = = = It is not known exactly when S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are began writing , but contemporary al@@ lu@@ sions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 15@@ 92 .
after the death of Queen Elizabeth in 16@@ 03 , the company was awarded a royal pat@@ ent by the new king , James I , and changed its name to the King 's Men .
in 15@@ 99 , a partnership of company members built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Tha@@ mes , which they called the Glo@@ be .
in 16@@ 08 , the partnership also took over the Bla@@ ck@@ fri@@ ars in@@ door theatre .
in 15@@ 97 , he bought the second @@@ -@@ @ largest house in Str@@ at@@ ford , New Pla@@ ce , and in 16@@ 05 , he invested in a share of the par@@ ish ti@@ th@@ es in Str@@ at@@ ford .
by 15@@ 98 , his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages .
the 16@@ 16 edition of Ben Jon@@ son 's " Wor@@ ks " names him on the cast lists for " Every Man in H@@ is Hum@@ our " ( 15@@ 98 ) and " Se@@ jan@@ us H@@ is F@@ all " ( 16@@ 03 ) .
S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are divided his time between London and Str@@ at@@ ford during his career .
in 15@@ 96 , the year before he bought New Pla@@ ce as his family home in Str@@ at@@ ford , S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are was living in the par@@ ish of St. H@@ elen 's , Bis@@ hop@@ s@@ gate , north of the River Tha@@ mes .
he moved across the river to Sou@@ thwar@@ k by 15@@ 99 , the year his company constructed the Glo@@ be Theatre there .
by 16@@ 04 , he had moved north of the river again , to an area north of St Paul 's Cath@@ edr@@ al with many fine houses .
there he ren@@ ted rooms from a French H@@ ug@@ u@@ en@@ ot named Christopher Moun@@ t@@ joy , a maker of ladi@@ es ' w@@ ig@@ s and other head@@ ge@@ ar .
in 16@@ 12 , he was called as a witness in " Bel@@ lot@@ t V@@ . Moun@@ t@@ joy , " a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Moun@@ t@@ joy 's daughter , Mary .
in March 16@@ 13 he bought a g@@ ate@@ house in the former Bla@@ ck@@ fri@@ ars pri@@ ory ; and from November 16@@ 14 he was in London for several weeks with his son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , John Hall .
after 16@@ 10 , S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are wrote fewer plays , and none are attributed to him after 16@@ 13 .
his last three plays were collabor@@ ations , probably with John F@@ let@@ cher , who succeeded him as the house play@@ wright for the King 's Men .
S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are died on 23 April 16@@ 16 , at the age of 52 .
Sus@@ anna had married a physi@@ cian , John Hall , in 16@@ 07 , and Judi@@ th had married Thomas Qu@@ in@@ ey , a vin@@ t@@ ner , two months before S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are 's death .
in his will , S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are left the bul@@ k of his large estate to his el@@ der daughter Sus@@ anna .
the Qu@@ in@@ ey@@ s had three children , all of whom died without mar@@ rying .
S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are was buried in the chan@@ cel of the Holy Tr@@ in@@ ity Church two days after his death .
its pla@@ que compar@@ es him to N@@ est@@ or , So@@ c@@ rates , and Virgil .
S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are has been commemor@@ ated in many stat@@ ues and mem@@ ori@@ als around the world , including funeral monuments in Sou@@ thwar@@ k Cath@@ edr@@ al and Po@@ ets ' Corner in W@@ est@@ min@@ ster Ab@@ be@@ y .
the early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizab@@ e@@ than dram@@ ati@@ sts , especially Thomas Ky@@ d and Christopher Mar@@ lo@@ we , by the traditions of medieval drama , and by the plays of Sen@@ ec@@ a .
his charac@@ ters become more complex and tender as he swit@@ ches def@@ tly between com@@ ic and serious scen@@ es , pro@@ se and poetry , and achiev@@ es the nar@@ r@@ ative variety of his mature work .
in this play , S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are adds a super@@ natural element to the tra@@ gic structure .
his last major tra@@ ge@@ dies , " Anton@@ y and C@@ le@@ op@@ at@@ ra " and " Cor@@ i@@ olan@@ us , " contain some of S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are 's fin@@ est poetry and were considered his most successful tra@@ ge@@ dies by the poet and cri@@ tic T@@ . S. Eli@@ ot .
some comment@@ ators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more ser@@ ene view of life on S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are 's part , but it may mer@@ ely reflect the theat@@ ri@@ cal fashion of the day .
S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are collabor@@ ated on two further survi@@ ving plays , " Henry V@@ III " and " The T@@ wo N@@ ob@@ le K@@ ins@@ men , " probably with John F@@ let@@ cher .

the behaviour of matter at the mo@@ lec@@ ular scale including its den@@ s@@ ity is determined by the balance between the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the elec@@ tr@@ ons themselves .
mar@@ in@@ ers had noticed that ligh@@ t@@ ning strikes had the ability to distur@@ b a comp@@ ass ne@@ ed@@ le , but the link between ligh@@ t@@ ning and electricity was not confirmed until Benjamin Frank@@ lin 's proposed experim@@ ents in 17@@ 52 .
however , the effect did not become widely known until 18@@ 20 , when Ø@@ r@@ s@@ ted performed a similar experim@@ ent .
Ø@@ r@@ s@@ ted 's work influenced A@@ mp@@ è@@ re to produce a theory of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism that set the subject on a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal foundation .
in classical elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism , the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field obe@@ ys a set of equ@@ ations known as Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations , and the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force is given by the Lor@@ ent@@ z force law .
one of the pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar@@ ities of classical elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism is that it is difficult to reconc@@ ile with classical mechan@@ ics , but it is compatible with special rela@@ tivity .
after important contributions of H@@ end@@ rik Lor@@ ent@@ z and Hen@@ ri Po@@ inc@@ ar@@ é , in 19@@ 05 , Albert E@@ in@@ stein solved the problem with the introduction of special rela@@ tivity , which replaces classical kin@@ em@@ atics with a new theory of kin@@ em@@ atics that is compatible with classical elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism .
( for more information , see History of special rela@@ tivity .
( for more information , see Clas@@ sical elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism and special rela@@ tivity and C@@ ov@@ ar@@ i@@ ant formu@@ lation of classical elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism .
both of these results were in direct con@@ tradi@@ ction with the classical view of light as a continuous wave .
this theory , completed in the 19@@ 4@@ 0s @@@ -@@ @ 19@@ 5@@ 0s , is known as qu@@ ant@@ um elec@@ tro@@ dynam@@ ics ( or " Q@@ E@@ D " ) , and , in situations where per@@ tur@@ b@@ ation theory is applic@@ able , is one of the most accur@@ ate the@@ ories known to physi@@ cs .
electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field .
there are two types of electric charges : positive and negative .
the inter@@ action between a moving charge and an elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field is the source of the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force , which is one of the four fundamental forces ( Se@@ e also : mag@@ ne@@ tic field ) .
electric charge is a character@@ istic property of many sub@@ at@@ om@@ ic parti@@ c@@ les .
Robert Mil@@ lik@@ an 's oil @@@ -@@ @ drop experim@@ ent demonstrated this fact directly , and meas@@ ured the elementary charge .
this charge is often small , because matter is made of At@@ oms , and At@@ oms typically have equal numbers of pro@@ t@@ ons and elec@@ tr@@ ons , in which case their charges can@@ cel out , yi@@ el@@ ding a net charge of zero , thus making the atom neutral .
when the net electric charge of an object is non @@@ -@@ @ zero and mo@@ tion@@ less , the phenomenon is known as st@@ atic electricity .
this can easily be produced by rub@@ bing two dis@@ similar materials together , such as rub@@ bing Am@@ ber with f@@ ur or glass with sil@@ k .
charge taken from one material is moved to the other material , leaving an opposite charge of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de behind .
in such cases the object is said to be polar@@ ized .
the motion of elec@@ tr@@ ons in conduc@@ tive met@@ als in a specific direction is known as electric current .
after finding the quanti@@ z@@ ed character of charge , in 18@@ 91 George St@@ on@@ ey proposed the unit ' elec@@ tr@@ on ' for this fundamental unit of electrical charge .
this was before the discovery of the parti@@ cle by J@@ .@@ J@@ . Thom@@ son in 18@@ 97 .
in 18@@ 39 , Michael Far@@ aday showed that the apparent division between st@@ atic electricity , current electricity , and bio@@ electricity was incor@@ rec@@ t , and all were a consequence of the behavi@@ or of a single kind of electricity appe@@ aring in opposite polar@@ ities .
one of the fore@@ most experts on electricity in the 18th century was Benjamin Frank@@ lin , who argued in favour of a one @@@ -@@ @ f@@ lu@@ id theory of electricity .
Frank@@ lin imag@@ ined electricity as being a type of in@@ visible f@@ lu@@ id present in all matter ; for example , he believed that it was the glass in a L@@ ey@@ den j@@ ar that held the acc@@ um@@ ulated charge .
William Wat@@ son arrived at the same explanation at about the same time .
an elec@@ tro@@ st@@ atic dis@@ charge creates a change in the charge of each of the two objects .
in contrast , electric current is the flow of electric charge through an object , which produces no net loss or gain of electric charge .
* E@@ ach piece of glass attr@@ acts each piece of res@@ in .
it is now known that the Frank@@ lin / Wat@@ son model was fundament@@ ally correct .
there is only one kind of electrical charge , and only one vari@@ able is required to keep track of the amount of charge .
on the other hand , just kno@@ wing the charge is not a complete descri@@ ption of the situation .
matter is composed of several kinds of electri@@ cally charged parti@@ c@@ les , and these parti@@ c@@ les have many properties , not just charge .
the movement of any of these charged parti@@ c@@ les constitu@@ tes an electric current .
this mac@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic vie@@ w@@ point is an approxim@@ ation that simp@@ li@@ fies elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic concep@@ ts and calc@@ ulations .
be@@ w@@ are that , in the common and important case of metal@@ lic wi@@ res , the direction of the conventional current is opposite to the dri@@ ft v@@ el@@ o@@ city of the actual charge carriers , i@@ .@@ e@@ . , the elec@@ tr@@ ons .
this means that any parti@@ cle that has charge " Q , " no matter how fast it goes , always has charge " Q@@ . "
= = Con@@ servation of electric charge = = The total electric charge of an isolated system remains constant regardless of changes within the system itself .
in early 18@@ 17 , Scho@@ ber introduced Sch@@ ub@@ ert to Johan@@ n Michael V@@ og@@ l , a prominent bar@@ it@@ one twenty years Sch@@ ub@@ ert 's senior .
he is remember@@ ed today largely for his book " De Mag@@ n@@ ete " ( 1@@ 600 ) , and is credi@@ ted as one of the origin@@ ators of the term " electricity . "
he is regarded by some as the father of electrical engineering or electricity and mag@@ ne@@ tism .
while today he is generally referred to as William G@@ il@@ bert , he also went under the name of William G@@ il@@ ber@@ d .
he was educated at St John 's College , C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge .
in 1@@ 600 he was elected President of the College .
from 16@@ 01 until her death in 16@@ 03 , he was Elizabeth I 's own physi@@ cian , and James VI and I renewed his appointment .

in physi@@ cs , moment is a combination of a physical quanti@@ ty and a distance .
mom@@ ents are usually defined with respect to a fixed reference point or ax@@ is ; they deal with physical quantities as meas@@ ured at some distance from that reference point or ax@@ is .
for example , a moment of force is the product of a force and its distance from an ax@@ is , which causes ro@@ tation about that ax@@ is .
at that point : : formula _ 1 , where formula _ 2 is the physical quanti@@ ty such as a force applied at a point , or a point charge , or a point mass , et@@ c .
if the quanti@@ ty is not concentrated solely at a single point , the moment is the integral of that quanti@@ ty 's den@@ s@@ ity over space : : formula _ 3@@ where formula _ 4 is the distribution of the den@@ s@@ ity of charge , mass , or whatever quanti@@ ty is being considered .
the techni@@ que can also be used to determine the properties of an unknown distribution formula _ 4 .

RT@@ P is used in con@@ jun@@ ction with the RT@@ P Control Pro@@ to@@ col ( RT@@ C@@ P ) .
while RT@@ P carries the media stre@@ ams ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . , audio and video ) , RT@@ C@@ P is used to monitor transmission statistics and quality of service ( Q@@ o@@ S ) and ai@@ ds syn@@ chron@@ ization of multiple stre@@ ams .
RT@@ P allows data transfer to multiple destinations through IP mul@@ tic@@ ast .
other transport protocols specifically designed for multi@@ media sessions are SC@@ TP and DC@@ C@@ P , although , , they are not in widespread use .
= = pro@@ files and pay@@ load form@@ ats = = One of the design consider@@ ations of RT@@ P was to carry a range of multi@@ media form@@ ats ( such as H@@ .@@ 2@@ 64 , MP@@ E@@ G @@@ -@@ @ 4 , M@@ J@@ PE@@ G , MP@@ E@@ G , et@@ c .
the design of RT@@ P is based on the architectural principle known as application level f@@ ram@@ ing ( Al@@ f ) .
the information required by a specific application 's needs is not included in the gener@@ ic RT@@ P he@@ ader , but is instead provided through RT@@ P pro@@ files and pay@@ load form@@ ats .
the " profile " defin@@ es the co@@ dec@@ s used to en@@ code the pay@@ load data and their m@@ apping to pay@@ load form@@ at co@@ des in the pay@@ load T@@ y@@ pe ( P@@ T ) field of the RT@@ P he@@ ader ( see below ) .
the audio pay@@ load form@@ ats include G@@ .@@ 7@@ 11 , G@@ .@@ 7@@ 23 , G@@ .@@ 7@@ 26 , G@@ .@@ 7@@ 29 , GSM , Q@@ CE@@ L@@ P , MP@@ 3 , and D@@ TM@@ F , and the video pay@@ load form@@ ats include H@@ .@@ 2@@ 61 , H@@ .@@ 2@@ 63 , H@@ .@@ 2@@ 64 , and MP@@ E@@ G @@@ -@@ @ 4 .
* P ( P@@ adding ) : ( 1 bit ) used to indicate if there are extra p@@ adding by@@ tes at the end of the RT@@ P p@@ ac@@ ket .
* X ( Ex@@ tension ) : ( 1 bit ) Indic@@ ates presence of an " Ex@@ tension he@@ ader " between standard he@@ ader and pay@@ load data .
* C@@ C ( CS@@ RC Coun@@ t ) : ( 4 bi@@ ts ) contains the number of CS@@ RC identi@@ fi@@ ers ( defined below ) that follow the fixed he@@ ader .
* M ( mar@@ ker ) : ( 1 bit ) used at the application level and defined by a profile .
if it is set , it means that the current data has some special re@@ lev@@ ance for the application .
this is specified by an RT@@ P profile .
* sequ@@ ence N@@ um@@ ber : ( 16 bi@@ ts ) The sequ@@ ence number is incre@@ mented by one for each RT@@ P data p@@ ac@@ ket sent and is to be used by the recei@@ ver to detec@@ t p@@ ac@@ ket loss and to restore p@@ ac@@ ket sequ@@ ence .
when several media stre@@ ams are present , the time@@ st@@ amp@@ s are independent in each stream , and may not be reli@@ ed upon for media syn@@ chron@@ ization .
* S@@ S@@ RC : ( 32 bi@@ ts ) Syn@@ chron@@ ization source identi@@ fi@@ er uni@@ qu@@ ely identi@@ fies the source of a stream .
the syn@@ chron@@ ization sources within the same RT@@ P session will be unique .
protocols such as SI@@ P , J@@ ing@@ le , RT@@ SP , H@@ .@@ 225 and H@@ .@@ 2@@ 45 are used for session initi@@ ation , control and termin@@ ation .

his last published work , a nov@@ ella entitled " H@@ ap@@ worth 16 , 19@@ 24 , " appeared in " The New Yor@@ ker " on June 19 , 19@@ 65 .
= = E@@ arly life and experiences = = Jer@@ ome David Sal@@ inger was born in New York City , on New Year 's Day , 19@@ 19 .
his mother , Marie ( n@@ é@@ e J@@ illi@@ ch ) , was born in Atlantic , I@@ ow@@ a , of S@@ co@@ tti@@ sh , German , and Irish des@@ cent .
his pat@@ er@@ nal grand@@ father , Simon , born in Lithuania , was at one time the rab@@ bi for the Ad@@ ath J@@ es@@ hur@@ un Con@@ gre@@ gation in Lou@@ is@@ vil@@ le , Kent@@ uc@@ ky .
his father , Sol Sal@@ inger , sold kos@@ her cheese .
as a youth , Sal@@ inger attended public schools on the West S@@ ide of Man@@ hat@@ tan .
then in 19@@ 32 , the family moved to Park Av@@ en@@ ue , and Sal@@ inger was enrol@@ led at the Mc@@ Bur@@ ney School , a nearby private school .
though he had written for the school newspaper at Mc@@ Bur@@ ney , Sal@@ inger began writing stories " under the covers night , with the aid of a fl@@ ash@@ light . "
he also participated in the G@@ le@@ e Club , Avi@@ ation Club , French Club , and the N@@ on @@@ -@@ @ commissioned Offic@@ ers Club .
Sal@@ inger started his fres@@ h@@ man year at New York University in 19@@ 36 .
that fall , his father urged him to learn about the meat @@@ -@@ @ importing business , and he went to work at a company in Vienna , Austria .
he left Austria one month before it was an@@ ne@@ xed by Nazi Germany on March 12 , 19@@ 38 .

in late 19@@ 41 , Sal@@ inger brief@@ ly worked on a Car@@ ib@@ be@@ an cruise ship , serving as an activity director and possibly as a per@@ former .
the same year , Sal@@ inger began submitting short stories to " The New Yor@@ ker . "
he was active at U@@ ta@@ h B@@ each on D @@@ -@@ @ Day , in the B@@ attle of the Bul@@ ge , and the B@@ attle of Hür@@ t@@ gen Fo@@ rest .
during the campaign from Nor@@ man@@ dy into Germany , Sal@@ inger arran@@ ged to meet with Ern@@ est Hem@@ ing@@ way , a writer who had influenced him and was then working as a war correspondent in Paris .
he lived in We@@ is@@ sen@@ burg and , soon after , married Sy@@ l@@ via Wel@@ ter .
he brought her to the United States in April 19@@ 46 , but the marriage fell apart after eight months and Sy@@ l@@ via returned to Germany .
in 197@@ 2 , Sal@@ inger 's daughter Margar@@ et was with him when he received a letter from Sy@@ l@@ via .
" in 19@@ 46 , W@@ hit Bur@@ net@@ t agreed to help Sal@@ inger publish a collection of his short stories through " St@@ ory " Press 's Lip@@ pin@@ cot@@ t im@@ print .
in the early 19@@ 4@@ 0s , Sal@@ inger had confi@@ ded in a letter to W@@ hit Bur@@ net@@ t that he was e@@ ager to sell the film rights to some of his stories in order to achieve financial security .
therefore he immediately agreed when , in mid @@@ -@@ @ 19@@ 48 , independent film producer Samuel Gol@@ d@@ w@@ y@@ n offered to buy the film rights to his short story " Un@@ cle W@@ ig@@ gil@@ y in Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut . "
it spent 30 weeks on the " New York Times " best@@ seller list .
the book remains widely read ; in 2004 , the novel was selling about 250,000 cop@@ ies per year , " with total worldwide sales over 10 million cop@@ ies . "
since its publication , there has been sustained interest in the novel among filmmakers , with Bil@@ ly Wil@@ der , Harvey We@@ in@@ stein , and Steven Sp@@ i@@ el@@ berg among those seeking to secure the rights .
Sal@@ inger stated in the 197@@ 0s that " Jer@@ ry Le@@ w@@ is tried for years to get his hands on the part of Hol@@ den .

a more general@@ ized descri@@ ption of nano@@ technology was subsequently established by the National N@@ ano@@ technology Initiative , which defin@@ es nano@@ technology as the manip@@ ulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nano@@ meters .
because of the variety of potential applications ( including industrial and military ) , governments have invested billions of dollars in nano@@ technology research .
through its National N@@ ano@@ technology Initiative , the U@@ SA has invested 3.@@ 7 billion dollars .
the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars .
nano@@ technology as defined by size is n@@ atur@@ ally very broad , including fields of science as di@@ verse as sur@@ face science , organ@@ ic chem@@ istry , mo@@ lec@@ ular bi@@ ology , sem@@ ic@@ on@@ duc@@ tor physi@@ cs , micro@@ fabri@@ cation , et@@ c .
these concerns have led to a debate among advoc@@ acy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nano@@ technology is war@@ ran@@ ted .
first , the in@@ vention of the s@@ can@@ ning tun@@ nel@@ ing mic@@ ros@@ cope in 1981 which provided unprecedented vis@@ u@@ al@@ ization of individual At@@ oms and bonds , and was successfully used to manip@@ ulate individual At@@ oms in 1989 .
the mic@@ ros@@ cope 's develop@@ ers Ger@@ d Bin@@ ni@@ g and Hein@@ rich Ro@@ h@@ rer at IBM Z@@ ur@@ ich Research Lab@@ or@@ atory received a Nobel Prize in P@@ hy@@ sics in 1986 .
Bin@@ ni@@ g , Qu@@ ate and Ger@@ ber also in@@ ven@@ ted the anal@@ og@@ ous at@@ om@@ ic force mic@@ ros@@ cope that year .
second , Ful@@ ler@@ en@@ es were discovered in 1985 by Harry K@@ ro@@ to , Richard S@@ mal@@ ley , and Robert Cur@@ l , who together won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Ch@@ em@@ istry .
in the early 200@@ 0s , the field garnered increased scientific , political , and commercial attention that led to both controversy and progress .
controversi@@ es emerged regarding the defin@@ itions and potential implications of nano@@ technologies , exemp@@ lified by the Royal Society 's report on nano@@ technology .
these products are limited to bul@@ k applications of n@@ an@@ om@@ ater@@ i@@ als and do not involve at@@ om@@ ic control of matter .
by the mid @@@ -@@ @ 200@@ 0s new and serious scientific attention began to flo@@ ur@@ ish .
= = F@@ un@@ dam@@ ental concep@@ ts = = N@@ ano@@ technology is the engineering of functional systems at the mo@@ lec@@ ular scale .
this covers both current work and concep@@ ts that are more advanced .
one nano@@ meter ( N@@ M ) is one billi@@ on@@ th , or 10 − 9 , of a meter .
on the other hand , the smal@@ lest cel@@ lular life @@@ -@@ @ forms , the bac@@ ter@@ ia of the gen@@ us My@@ cop@@ las@@ ma , are around 200 N@@ M in length .
by convention , nano@@ technology is taken as the scale range following the defin@@ ition used by the National N@@ ano@@ technology Initiative in the US .
to put that scale in another context , the compar@@ ative size of a nano@@ meter to a meter is the same as that of a mar@@ ble to the size of the ear@@ th .
in the " bottom @@@ -@@ @ up " approach , materials and devices are built from mo@@ lec@@ ular components which assem@@ ble themselves chem@@ ically by principles of mo@@ lec@@ ular recognition .
areas of physi@@ cs such as nano@@ electron@@ ics , nano@@ mechan@@ ics , n@@ an@@ op@@ ho@@ ton@@ ics and nano@@ ion@@ ics have evol@@ ved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nano@@ technology .
these include statistical mechan@@ ical effects , as well as qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ical effects , for example the " qu@@ ant@@ um size effect " where the electronic properties of sol@@ ids are alter@@ ed with great reductions in parti@@ cle size .
additionally , a number of physical ( mechan@@ ical , electrical , op@@ tical , et@@ c .
one example is the increase in sur@@ face area to volume rati@@ o alter@@ ing mechan@@ ical , thermal and cataly@@ tic properties of materials .
for instance , op@@ a@@ que substan@@ ces can become transparent ( cop@@ per ) ; stable materials can turn comb@@ us@@ ti@@ ble ( al@@ umin@@ ium ) ; in@@ sol@@ ub@@ le materials may become sol@@ ub@@ le ( gold ) .
a material such as gold , which is chem@@ ically in@@ ert at normal scal@@ es , can serve as a po@@ tent chemical cataly@@ st at n@@ an@@ os@@ cal@@ es .
= = = S@@ imp@@ le to complex : a mo@@ lec@@ ular perspective = = = Modern syn@@ thetic chem@@ istry has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les to almost any structure .
these approaches u@@ tili@@ ze the concep@@ ts of mo@@ lec@@ ular self @@@ -@@ @ assembly and / or sup@@ ram@@ o@@ lec@@ ular chem@@ istry to automatically arran@@ ge themselves into some useful con@@ formation through a bottom @@@ -@@ @ up approach .
the Wat@@ son @@@ -@@ @ Cri@@ ck bas@@ ep@@ air@@ ing rules are a direct result of this , as is the specif@@ ic@@ ity of an en@@ z@@ y@@ me being targeted to a single sub@@ str@@ ate , or the specific fol@@ ding of the prote@@ in itself .
thus , two or more components can be designed to be comple@@ mentary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole .
most useful structures require complex and ther@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ically unlikely arrangements of At@@ oms .
the challenge for nano@@ technology is whether these principles can be used to engine@@ er new construc@@ ts in addition to natural ones .
= = = Mo@@ lec@@ ular nano@@ technology : a long @@@ -@@ @ term view = = = Mo@@ lec@@ ular nano@@ technology , sometimes called mo@@ lec@@ ular manufacturing , describes engine@@ ered n@@ an@@ os@@ y@@ stems ( n@@ an@@ os@@ cal@@ e machines ) operating on the mo@@ lec@@ ular scale .
mo@@ lec@@ ular nano@@ technology is especially associated with the mo@@ lec@@ ular assemb@@ ler , a machine that can produce a desi@@ red structure or device atom @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ atom using the principles of mechan@@ os@@ yn@@ th@@ es@@ is .
another view , put forth by Carlo Mon@@ tem@@ ag@@ no , is that future n@@ an@@ os@@ y@@ stems will be hy@@ bri@@ ds of sil@@ ic@@ on technology and biological mo@@ lec@@ ular machines .
Richard S@@ mal@@ ley argued that mechan@@ os@@ yn@@ th@@ es@@ is are impossible due to the difficulties in mechan@@ ically manip@@ ulating individual mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les .
though bi@@ ology clearly demonstrates that mo@@ lec@@ ular machine systems are possible , non @@@ -@@ @ biological mo@@ lec@@ ular machines are today only in their inf@@ ancy .
leaders in research on non @@@ -@@ @ biological mo@@ lec@@ ular machines are Dr. Ale@@ x Z@@ et@@ t@@ l and his colleagues at Lawrence Ber@@ ke@@ ley laborat@@ ories and U@@ C Ber@@ ke@@ ley .
an experim@@ ent indicating that positi@@ onal mo@@ lec@@ ular assembly is possible was performed by H@@ o and Le@@ e at Cor@@ n@@ ell University in 1999 .
* n@@ an@@ os@@ cal@@ e materials such as n@@ an@@ op@@ il@@ lars are sometimes used in solar cells which comb@@ ats the cost of traditional Sil@@ ic@@ on solar cells .

* More generally , mo@@ lec@@ ular self @@@ -@@ @ assembly seeks to use concep@@ ts of sup@@ ram@@ o@@ lec@@ ular chem@@ istry , and mo@@ lec@@ ular recognition in particular , to cause single @@@ -@@ @ mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e components to automatically arran@@ ge themselves into some useful con@@ formation .
Peter Gr@@ ün@@ berg and Albert Fer@@ t received the Nobel Prize in P@@ hy@@ sics in 2007 for their discovery of giant mag@@ net@@ o@@ resistance and contributions to the field of sp@@ in@@ tron@@ ics .
* Sol@@ id @@@ -@@ @ state techniques can also be used to create devices known as nano@@ elec@@ tro@@ mechan@@ ical systems or N@@ E@@ MS , which are related to micro@@ elec@@ tro@@ mechan@@ ical systems or ME@@ MS .
for example , this techni@@ que is used rout@@ in@@ ely to create sub @@@ -@@ @ 100 N@@ M sections of material for analysis in Trans@@ mission elec@@ tr@@ on mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ y .
* Mo@@ lec@@ ular scale electron@@ ics seeks to develop mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les with useful electronic properties .
= = = Bi@@ om@@ i@@ me@@ tic approaches = = = * Bi@@ on@@ ics or bi@@ om@@ im@@ ic@@ ry seeks to apply biological methods and systems found in nature , to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology .
* Bi@@ on@@ ano@@ technology is the use of bi@@ omo@@ lec@@ u@@ les for applications in nano@@ technology , including use of vir@@ uses and li@@ p@@ id assemb@@ lies .

video game con@@ so@@ les and personal computers may become cheaper , faster , and contain more memory thanks to nano@@ technology .
nano@@ technology may have the ability to make existing medical applications cheaper and easier to use in places like the general practi@@ tion@@ er 's office and at home .
for these reasons , some groups advocate that nano@@ technology be regulated by governments .
so those sor@@ ts of materials need to be handled very carefully .

she used an innovative techni@@ que to investigate samples .
fif@@ teen years earlier , her husband and his brother had developed a version of the elec@@ tro@@ meter , a sensitive device for measuring electric charge .

= = = = Pro@@ du@@ ction = = = = The IS @@@ -@@ @ 1@@ 22 proto@@ type replaced the IS @@@ -@@ @ 85 , and began mass production as the IS @@@ -@@ @ 2 .
the main production model was the IS @@@ -@@ @ 2 , with the powerful A @@@ -@@ @ 19 .
is @@@ -@@ @ 3 ( object 7@@ 03 ) was developed in late 19@@ 44 by Ch@@ T@@ Z ( in C@@ hel@@ y@@ ab@@ ins@@ k ) and left the factory shop in May 1945 .
starting in 1960 , the IS @@@ -@@ @ 3 was slightly moderniz@@ ed as the IS @@@ -@@ @ 3m , in a manner similar to the IS @@@ -@@ @ 2m .
the other IS @@@ -@@ @ 4 was a new vehicle projected by L@@ K@@ Z in parallel with the IS @@@ -@@ @ 3 ( object 7@@ 03 ) by the same design and development bureau .
several alternative ar@@ mam@@ ents were explo@@ red in paper studies but ultimately the IS @@@ -@@ @ 2 's original 12@@ 2@@ m@@ m gun was re@@ tained .
the tank was approved for mass production from 19@@ 47 to 19@@ 49 but due to dis@@ appointing speed and mo@@ bility only 250 were built .
similar systems had been tested previously in France and the United States and had been used with some success in the German Elef@@ ant / Fer@@ din@@ and tank destro@@ yer during World War II .

General performance was similar , although the T @@@ -@@ @ 10 could carry more ammunition .
this was the last Soviet heavy tank to enter service .
when the advanced T @@@ -@@ @ 64 M@@ B@@ T became available it replaced the T @@@ -@@ @ 10 in front line form@@ ations .
these reg@@ im@@ ents were used to reinforce the most important attack sectors during major offensive operations .
the IS @@@ -@@ @ 3 first appeared to Western observers at the Allied Vic@@ tory Par@@ ade in Berlin in September 1945 .
the IS @@@ -@@ @ 3 was an impressive development in the eyes of Western military observers , the British in particular , who responded with heavy tank design@@ s of their own .
in the late 19@@ 6@@ 0s the remaining Soviet heavy tanks were transferred to Red Army reserve service and storage .
the IS @@@ -@@ @ 2 Mo@@ del 19@@ 44 remained in active service much longer in the armies of Cub@@ a , China and North Korea .
in response to border disputes between the Soviet Union and China , some Soviet IS @@@ -@@ @ 3@@ s were du@@ g in as fixed pil@@ l@@ boxes along the Soviet @@@ -@@ @ Chinese border .
the IS @@@ -@@ @ 3 was used in the 19@@ 56 Soviet inv@@ asion of Hungary and the Prague Spring in 19@@ 68 .
after the Korean War , China attempted to rever@@ se @@@ -@@ @ engine@@ er the IS @@@ -@@ @ 2 / IS @@@ -@@ @ 3 as the T@@ y@@ pe 1@@ 22 medium tank .

they describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it , and its motion in response to said forces .
for example , in the third volume of the text , New@@ ton showed that these laws of motion , combined with his law of universal gra@@ v@@ itation , explained K@@ ep@@ ler 's laws of plan@@ etary motion .
in the given interpre@@ tation mass , acceler@@ ation , momentum , and ( most importantly ) force are assumed to be ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally defined quantities .
New@@ ton 's laws of motion , together with his law of universal gra@@ v@@ itation and the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal techniques of cal@@ cul@@ us , provided for the first time a unified quanti@@ t@@ ative explanation for a wide range of physical phenom@@ ena .

some states , such as Russia and China , recogn@@ ize the Palestinian state with East Jer@@ usalem as its capital .
United N@@ ations General Assembly Resolution 58 / 2@@ 92 affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over East Jer@@ usalem .
the K@@ id@@ ron , Hin@@ no@@ m , and T@@ y@@ ro@@ po@@ e@@ on val@@ ley@@ s inter@@ sec@@ t in an area just south of the Old City of Jer@@ usalem .
Jer@@ usalem is east of Tel Avi@@ v and the Mediterranean Sea .
on the opposite side of the city , approximately away , is the De@@ ad Sea , the lowest body of water on Earth .
Mount Herz@@ l , at the western side of the city near the Jer@@ usalem Fo@@ rest , serves as the national ce@@ metery of Israel .
since medieval times , the Old City of Jer@@ usalem has been divided into Jewish , Muslim , Christian , and Armenian quarters .
in 2005 , 2,@@ 850 new immigrants settled in Jer@@ usalem , mostly from the United States , France and the former Soviet Union .
in 2005 , 16,000 left Jer@@ usalem and only 10,000 moved in .
nevertheless , the population of Jer@@ usalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate , especially in the H@@ are@@ di Jewish and Arab communities .
in 1967 , Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population , while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent .
many move to the subur@@ bs and coastal cities in search of cheaper housing and a more secular lif@@ estyle .
this cor@@ rela@@ tes with the high number of children in H@@ are@@ di families .
demo@@ graph@@ ics and the Jewish @@@ -@@ @ Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jer@@ usalem .
in May 2012 , it was reported that the Jewish birth@@ rate had over@@ taken the Arab birth@@ rate .
currently , the city 's birth@@ rate stands about 4.@@ 2 children per Jewish family and 3.@@ 9 children per Arab family .
although not mentioned in the Tor@@ ah / Pent@@ ate@@ u@@ ch , it is mentioned in the Bi@@ ble 6@@ 32 times .
today , the Western Wall , a re@@ mn@@ ant of the wall surrounding the Second Tem@@ ple , is a Jewish hol@@ y site second only to the Holy of Hol@@ ies on the Tem@@ ple Mount itself .
according to the New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , J@@ es@@ us was brought to Jer@@ usalem soon after his birth and later in his life cleans@@ ed the Second Tem@@ ple .
the Israel Museum attr@@ acts nearly one million visitors a year , approximately one @@@ -@@ @ third of them tourists .
the museum has a large out@@ door sculpture gar@@ den and a scale @@@ -@@ @ model of the Second Tem@@ ple .
the national ce@@ metery of Israel is located at the city 's western edge , near the Jer@@ usalem Fo@@ rest on Mount Herz@@ l .
it houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles .
further , Y@@ ad Vas@@ hem commemor@@ ates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Naz@@ is , and hon@@ ors the R@@ igh@@ te@@ ous among the N@@ ations .
the Jer@@ usalem S@@ ymp@@ h@@ ony Orchestra , established in the 19@@ 4@@ 0s , has appeared around the world .
the International Convention Center ( " Bin@@ yan@@ ei Ha@@ U@@ ma " ) near the entrance to city houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra .
Jer@@ usalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009 .
the Jewish @@@ -@@ @ Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music .
in 2006 , a Jer@@ usalem Tra@@ il was opened , a hi@@ king tra@@ il that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around Jer@@ usalem .
= = Media = = Jer@@ usalem is the state broadcasting cen@@ ter of Israel .
= = Economy = = histor@@ ically , Jer@@ usalem 's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pil@@ gri@@ ms , as it was located far from the major ports of J@@ aff@@ a and Gaza .
although many statistics indicate economic growth in the city , since 1967 East Jer@@ usalem has la@@ gged behind the development of West Jer@@ usalem .
according to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel ( AC@@ RI ) , 78 % of Palest@@ in@@ ians in Jer@@ usalem lived in poverty in 2012 .
this marks a steady increase from 2006 when 64 % of Palest@@ in@@ ians were in poverty .
in 2006 , the average monthly income for a worker in Jer@@ usalem was N@@ IS@@ 5,@@ 9@@ 40 ( US $ 1,@@ 4@@ 10 ) , N@@ IS@@ 1,@@ 350 less than that for a worker in Tel Avi@@ v .
only 8.@@ 5 % of the Jer@@ usalem District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector , which is half the national average ( 15.@@ 8 % ) .
the Jer@@ usalem Central B@@ us St@@ ation , located on J@@ aff@@ a Road , is the bu@@ si@@ est bus station in Israel .
founded in 19@@ 25 , the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w University of Jer@@ usalem has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world .
the Board of Govern@@ ors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert E@@ in@@ stein and Sig@@ m@@ und Fre@@ ud .
today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of Israel .
it describes itself as the " only Arab university in Jer@@ usalem . "
new York Bar@@ d College and Al @@@ -@@ @ Qu@@ ds University agreed to open a joint colle@@ ge in a building originally built to house the Palestinian legislative Council and Y@@ ass@@ er A@@ raf@@ at 's office .
it is one of many schools in Jer@@ usalem , from elementary school and up , that comb@@ ine secular and religious studies .
schools for Ara@@ bs in Jer@@ usalem and other parts of Israel have been cri@@ ti@@ ciz@@ ed for offering a lower quality education than those cat@@ ering to Israeli Jewish students .
a budget of 4.@@ 6 billion sh@@ ek@@ els was allocated for this project .
Be@@ it@@ ar Jer@@ usalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel .
Jer@@ usalem 's other major football team , and one of Be@@ it@@ ar 's top rivals , is H@@ ap@@ o@@ el Jer@@ usalem F@@ .@@ C.
whereas Be@@ it@@ ar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times , H@@ ap@@ o@@ el has won the Cup only once .
Be@@ it@@ ar has won the top league six times , while H@@ ap@@ o@@ el has never succeeded .
Be@@ it@@ ar plays in the more prestigious L@@ ig@@ at Ha@@ Al , while H@@ ap@@ o@@ el is in the second division L@@ ig@@ a Le@@ um@@ it .
the most popular Palestinian football club is J@@ ab@@ al Al M@@ uk@@ ab@@ er ( since 197@@ 6 ) which plays in West Bank Pre@@ m@@ ier League .

the total mass of a star is the principal determin@@ ant of its evol@@ ution and eventual fate .
to explain why these stars ex@@ er@@ ted no net gra@@ vit@@ ational pull on the So@@ lar System , I@@ sa@@ ac New@@ ton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction , an idea prompted by the the@@ olo@@ gian Richard B@@ ent@@ ley .
his son John Her@@ sch@@ el repeated this study in the southern hem@@ is@@ phere and found a correspon@@ ding increase in the same direction .
in addition to his other accomplis@@ hments , William Her@@ sch@@ el is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not mer@@ ely lie along the same line of sight , but are also physical compan@@ ions that form bin@@ ary star systems .
the science of ste@@ l@@ lar spec@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ y was p@@ ion@@ e@@ ered by Joseph von Fra@@ un@@ ho@@ fer and Angel@@ o Sec@@ chi .
in 18@@ 65 Sec@@ chi began clas@@ si@@ fying stars into spec@@ tral types .
in 18@@ 34 , Fri@@ ed@@ rich Bes@@ sel observed changes in the proper motion of the star S@@ iri@@ us , and in@@ ferred a hidden compan@@ ion .
the first solution to the problem of der@@ i@@ ving an or@@ bit of bin@@ ary stars from tele@@ scope ob@@ serv@@ ations was made by F@@ eli@@ x Sav@@ ary in 18@@ 27 .
the tw@@ enti@@ eth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the scientific study of stars .
the photo@@ graph became a valuable astronom@@ ical tool .
in 19@@ 21 Albert A. Michel@@ son made the first meas@@ ure@@ ments of a ste@@ l@@ lar di@@ ame@@ ter using an inter@@ fer@@ o@@ meter on the Ho@@ ok@@ er tele@@ scope .
in 19@@ 13 , the Her@@ t@@ z@@ sp@@ run@@ g @@@ -@@ @ Rus@@ sell di@@ ag@@ ram was developed , pro@@ p@@ elling the astro@@ physical study of stars .
( U@@ ran@@ us and N@@ ep@@ tune were also Greek and Roman go@@ ds , but neither plan@@ et was known in Anti@@ qu@@ ity because of their low bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
the German as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer Johan@@ n Bay@@ er created a series of star maps and applied Greek letters as de@@ sig@@ nations to the stars in each con@@ ste@@ l@@ lation .
one example of such a star @@@ -@@ @ forming region is the Ori@@ on Ne@@ bul@@ a .
once a region reaches a sufficient den@@ s@@ ity of matter to satisfy the criteria for je@@ ans instability , it begins to collapse under its own gra@@ vit@@ ational force .
early stars of less than 2 are called T T@@ aur@@ i stars , while those with greater mass are Her@@ big a@@ e / Be stars .
such stars are said to be on the main sequ@@ ence and are called d@@ war@@ f stars .
the S@@ un , for example , is estimated to have increased in l@@ umin@@ os@@ ity by about 40 % since it reached the main sequ@@ ence 4.@@ 6 billion ( 4.@@ 6 × 109 ) years ago .
every star gener@@ ates a ste@@ l@@ lar wind of parti@@ c@@ les that causes a contin@@ ual out@@ flow of gas into space .
for most stars , the mass lost is neg@@ li@@ gible .
the S@@ un los@@ es 10 − 14 every year , or about 0.@@ 01 % of its total mass over its entire lif@@ es@@ pan .
the dur@@ ation that a star sp@@ ends on the main sequ@@ ence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has to F@@ use and the rate at which it f@@ uses that fuel , i@@ .@@ e@@ .
for the S@@ un , its life is estimated to be about 10 billion ( 10@@ 10 ) years .
massive stars consum@@ e their fuel very rapidly and are short @@@ -@@ @ lived .
however , since the lif@@ es@@ pan of such stars is greater than the current age of the uni@@ verse ( 13.@@ 8 billion years ) , no stars under about 0.@@ 85 are expected to have moved off the main sequ@@ ence .
older , population II stars have substan@@ tially less metal@@ lic@@ ity than the younger , population I stars due to the composition of the mo@@ lec@@ ular cl@@ ou@@ ds from which they formed .
in relatively old , very massive stars , a large core of in@@ ert iron will acc@@ um@@ ulate in the cen@@ ter of the star .
if what remains after the ou@@ ter atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it sh@@ rin@@ ks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth , known as a white d@@ war@@ f .
in larger stars , fu@@ sion continues until the iron core has grown so large ( more than 1.4 ) that it can no longer support its own mass .
these heavy elements allow the formation of ro@@ cky plan@@ ets .
however the pro@@ portion of single star systems increases for smaller stars , so that only 25 % of red d@@ war@@ f@@ s are known to have ste@@ l@@ lar compan@@ ions .
a typical Gal@@ ax@@ y contains hundreds of billions of stars , and there are more than 100 billion ( 10@@ 11 ) gal@@ ax@@ ies in the ob@@ serv@@ able uni@@ verse .
the near@@ est star to the Earth , apart from the S@@ un , is Proxima Cent@@ aur@@ i , which is 3@@ 9.@@ 9 tril@@ lion kilo@@ metres , or 4.@@ 2 light @@@ -@@ @ years away .
travelling at the or@@ bi@@ tal speed of the Space shut@@ tle ( 8 kilo@@ metres per second - almost 30,000 kilo@@ metres per hour ) , it would take about 150,000 years to get there .
such col@@ lis@@ ions can produce what are known as blue stra@@ gg@@ lers .
= = = Age = = = Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old .
) The more massive the star , the shorter its lif@@ es@@ pan , primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their co@@ res , causing them to bur@@ n hydro@@ gen more rapidly .
the most massive stars last an average of a few million years , while stars of minimum mass ( red d@@ war@@ f@@ s ) bur@@ n their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years .
the S@@ un is also a star , but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a dis@@ k instead , and to provide day@@ light .
other than the S@@ un , the star with the largest apparent size is R Dor@@ ad@@ us , with an an@@ gular di@@ ame@@ ter of only 0.@@ 0@@ 57 ar@@ c@@ seconds .
Be@@ tel@@ ge@@ use , however , has a much lower den@@ s@@ ity than the S@@ un .
= = = K@@ in@@ em@@ atics = = = The motion of a star relative to the S@@ un can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star , as well as the structure and evol@@ ution of the surrounding Gal@@ ax@@ y .
stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the S@@ un , making them good candidates for paral@@ la@@ x meas@@ ure@@ ments .
among nearby stars , it has been found that younger population I stars have generally lower v@@ el@@ oc@@ ities than older , population II stars .
a study of the ar@@ ches cl@@ us@@ ter suggests that is the up@@ per limit for stars in the current era of the uni@@ verse .
this generation of super@@ massive , population III stars is long ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t , however , and currently only the@@ ore@@ tical .
with a mass only 93 times that of J@@ up@@ iter ( ) , AB Dor@@ ad@@ us C , a compan@@ ion to AB Dor@@ ad@@ us A , is the smal@@ lest known star undergoing nuclear fu@@ sion in its core .
giant stars have a much lower sur@@ face gra@@ vity than main sequ@@ ence stars , while the opposite is the case for de@@ generate , comp@@ act stars such as white d@@ war@@ f@@ s .
young stars can have a rapid rate of ro@@ tation greater than 100 km / s at the equ@@ ator .
this rate of ro@@ tation is just below the critical v@@ el@@ o@@ city of 300 km / s where the star would break apart .
the sur@@ face temper@@ ature of a star , along with its vis@@ ual absolute mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de and absorption features , is used to clas@@ si@@ fy a star ( see clas@@ si@@ fication below ) .
= = Radi@@ ation = = The energy produced by stars , as a product of nuclear fu@@ sion , radi@@ ates into space as both elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation and parti@@ cle radi@@ ation .
in fact , ste@@ l@@ lar elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation sp@@ ans the entire elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic spectrum , from the longest w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ ths of radio waves through inf@@ rar@@ ed , visible light , ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let , to the shor@@ test of X @@@ -@@ @ r@@ ays , and gam@@ ma r@@ ays .
) With these parame@@ ters , astronom@@ ers can also estimate the age of the star .
= = = L@@ umin@@ os@@ ity = = = The l@@ umin@@ os@@ ity of a star is the amount of light and other forms of radi@@ ant energy it radi@@ ates per unit of time .
the l@@ umin@@ os@@ ity of a star is determined by the radi@@ us and the sur@@ face temper@@ ature .
In@@ tr@@ in@@ sic or absolute mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de is directly related to a star 's l@@ umin@@ os@@ ity and is what the apparent mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 par@@ sec@@ s ( 3@@ 2.@@ 6 light @@@ -@@ @ years ) .
the bri@@ gh@@ test stars , on either scale , have negative mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de numbers .
despite Can@@ op@@ us being v@@ ast@@ ly more l@@ umin@@ ous than S@@ iri@@ us , however , S@@ iri@@ us appears bri@@ gh@@ ter than Can@@ op@@ us .
this is because S@@ iri@@ us is mer@@ ely 8.@@ 6 light @@@ -@@ @ years from the Earth , while Can@@ op@@ us is much far@@ ther away at a distance of 3@@ 10 light @@@ -@@ @ years .
as of 2006 , the star with the highest known absolute mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de is L@@ B@@ V 18@@ 06 @@@ -@@ @ 20 , with a mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of − 14.@@ 2 .
the least l@@ umin@@ ous stars that are currently known are located in the NG@@ C 6@@ 3@@ 97 cl@@ us@@ ter .

instead , for stars of more than 0.@@ 4 , fu@@ sion occur@@ s in a slowly expanding shel@@ l around the de@@ generate hel@@ ium core .
this can occur , for example , in regions where very high energy f@@ lux@@ es occur , such as near the core or in areas with high op@@ ac@@ ity as in the ou@@ ter en@@ v@@ elop@@ e .
this is the lay@@ er at which the plas@@ ma of the star becomes transparent to pho@@ t@@ ons of light .
in a main sequ@@ ence star such as the S@@ un , the lowest level of the atmosphere is the th@@ in ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ phere region , where sp@@ ic@@ u@@ les appear and ste@@ l@@ lar flar@@ es begin .
the hydro@@ gen fu@@ sion process is temper@@ ature @@@ -@@ @ sensitive , so a moderate increase in the core temper@@ ature will result in a significant increase in the fu@@ sion rate .
as a result the core temper@@ ature of main sequ@@ ence stars only var@@ ies from 4 million k@@ el@@ v@@ in for a small M @@@ -@@ @ class star to 40 million k@@ el@@ v@@ in for a massive O @@@ -@@ @ class star .
the example below shows the amount of time required for a star of 20 to consum@@ e all of its nuclear fuel .

mig@@ ra@@ ine is a chron@@ ic ne@@ ur@@ ological disease character@@ ized by rec@@ ur@@ rent moderate to severe head@@ aches often in association with a number of aut@@ onom@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system symp@@ t@@ oms .
typically the head@@ ache affects one half of the head , is pul@@ s@@ ating in nature , and lasts from 2 to 72 hours .
changing hor@@ m@@ one levels may also play a role , as mig@@ ra@@ ines affect slightly more boys than girls before pub@@ er@@ ty , but about two to three times more women than men .
the primary theory is related to increased exc@@ it@@ ability of the cer@@ e@@ br@@ al cor@@ te@@ x and ab@@ normal control of p@@ ain ne@@ ur@@ ons in the tri@@ gem@@ inal n@@ uc@@ le@@ us of the bra@@ in@@ stem .
= = = a@@ ura phase = = = A@@ n a@@ ura is a transi@@ ent fo@@ cal ne@@ ur@@ ological phenomenon that occur@@ s before or during the head@@ ache .
A@@ ur@@ as appear gradually over a number of minutes and generally last less than 60 minutes .
symp@@ t@@ oms can be vis@@ ual , sen@@ sory or motor in nature and many people experience more than one .
usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see c@@ olo@@ red lines .
often a feeling of p@@ ins @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ ed@@ les begins on one side in the hand and arm and sp@@ reads to the n@@ ose @@@ -@@ @ m@@ outh area on the same side .
motor symp@@ t@@ oms indicate that this is a hem@@ ip@@ leg@@ ic mig@@ ra@@ ine , and weak@@ ness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other aur@@ as .
the p@@ ain usually lasts 4 to 72 hours in adults , however in young children frequently lasts less than 1 hour .
however , they are believed to be related to a mi@@ x of environmental and gen@@ etic factors .
a number of psychological conditions are associated , including de@@ pression , anx@@ iety , and bi@@ po@@ lar dis@@ order , as are many biological events or tri@@ ggers .
this gen@@ etic relationship is stronger for mig@@ ra@@ ines with a@@ ura than for mig@@ ra@@ ines without a@@ ura .
one of these is known as fam@@ il@@ ial hem@@ ip@@ leg@@ ic mig@@ ra@@ ine , a type of mig@@ ra@@ ine with a@@ ura , which is inherited in an aut@@ os@@ om@@ al dominant fashion .
another gen@@ etic dis@@ order associated with mig@@ ra@@ ine is C@@ A@@ D@@ A@@ SI@@ L syn@@ dro@@ me or cer@@ e@@ br@@ al aut@@ os@@ om@@ al dominant ar@@ ter@@ i@@ op@@ ath@@ y with sub@@ cor@@ tical inf@@ ar@@ c@@ ts and le@@ uk@@ o@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ op@@ ath@@ y .
these hor@@ m@@ onal influ@@ ences seem to play a greater role in mig@@ ra@@ ine without a@@ ura .
some researchers believe ne@@ ur@@ onal mechanisms play a greater role , while others believe blood vessels play the key role .
high levels of the ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , also known as 5 @@@ -@@ @ hydro@@ x@@ y@@ try@@ p@@ tam@@ ine , are believed to be involved .
after the bur@@ st of activity the blood flow to the cer@@ e@@ br@@ al cor@@ te@@ x in the area affected is decreased for two to six hours .
in those with fewer than three of these symp@@ t@@ oms the prob@@ ability is 17 % .
* complic@@ ations of mig@@ ra@@ ine describe mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches and / or aur@@ as that are un@@ usually long or un@@ usually frequent , or associated with a seiz@@ ure or brain le@@ sion .
* prob@@ able mig@@ ra@@ ine describes conditions that have some character@@ isti@@ cs of mig@@ ra@@ ines , but where there is not enough evidence to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose it as a mig@@ ra@@ ine with certain@@ ty ( in the presence of con@@ current medi@@ cation over@@ use ) .
they often occur in those with either a personal or family history of typical mig@@ ra@@ ines .
this is a common problem and can result in chron@@ ic daily head@@ ache .
Tim@@ olo@@ l is also effective for mig@@ ra@@ ine prevention and in reducing mig@@ ra@@ ine attack frequ@@ ency and sever@@ ity , while fro@@ vat@@ ri@@ p@@ tan is effective for prevention of men@@ stru@@ al mig@@ ra@@ ine .
A@@ mit@@ ri@@ p@@ ty@@ line and ven@@ la@@ fa@@ x@@ ine are probably also effective .
Chi@@ ro@@ prac@@ tic manip@@ ulation , physi@@ other@@ ap@@ y , mas@@ sa@@ ge and rela@@ x@@ ation might be as effective as pro@@ p@@ ran@@ olo@@ l or top@@ ir@@ am@@ ate in the prevention of mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches ; however , the research had some problems with meth@@ od@@ ology .
= = = Dev@@ ices and surgery = = = Medi@@ cal devices , such as bi@@ of@@ e@@ ed@@ back and ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ti@@ mu@@ la@@ tors , have some advantages in mig@@ ra@@ ine prevention , mainly when common anti @@@ -@@ @ mig@@ ra@@ ine medi@@ c@@ ations are contra@@ indicated or in case of medi@@ cation over@@ use .
mig@@ ra@@ ine surgery , which involves de@@ com@@ pression of certain ner@@ ves around the head and nec@@ k , may be an option in certain people who do not improve with medi@@ c@@ ations .
A@@ spir@@ in can reli@@ eve moderate to severe mig@@ ra@@ ine p@@ ain , with an effectiveness similar to sum@@ at@@ ri@@ p@@ tan .
Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol ( also known as ac@@ et@@ am@@ in@@ oph@@ en ) , either alone or in combination with me@@ to@@ cl@@ op@@ ram@@ ide , is another effective treatment with a low risk of adver@@ se effects .
they are the initially recommended treat@@ ments for those with moderate to severe p@@ ain or those with mil@@ der symp@@ t@@ oms who do not respond to simple anal@@ ges@@ ics .
most side effects are mil@@ d , such as f@@ lus@@ hing ; however , rare cases of m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al is@@ chem@@ ia have occurred .
there are four main pat@@ ter@@ ns to the disease : symp@@ t@@ oms can resolve completely , symp@@ t@@ oms can continue but become gradually less with time , symp@@ t@@ oms may continue at the same frequ@@ ency and sever@@ ity , or attacks may become worse and more frequent .
being a young ad@@ ult , being female , using hor@@ m@@ onal contr@@ ac@@ eption , and smoking further increases this risk .
the relationship with heart problems is in@@ conclu@@ sive with a single study supporting an association .
rates of mig@@ ra@@ ines are slightly lower in Asia and Africa than in Western countries .
these figures v@@ ary substan@@ tially with age : mig@@ ra@@ ines most com@@ mon@@ ly start between 15 and 24 years of age and occur most frequently in those 35 to 45 years of age .

this leads to mis@@ charging of the t@@ R@@ NA by a chem@@ ically related am@@ ino ac@@ id .
the correct am@@ ino ac@@ id is made by en@@ z@@ y@@ mes that modi@@ fy the mis@@ charged am@@ ino ac@@ id to the correct one .
for example , " Hel@@ ic@@ ob@@ ac@@ ter p@@ y@@ lor@@ i " has gl@@ ut@@ am@@ in@@ y@@ l t@@ R@@ NA syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase missing .

Gal@@ il@@ e@@ o is the indi@@ gen@@ ous global navig@@ ation satellite system ( GN@@ SS ) that is currently being created by the European Union ( EU ) and the European Space Agency ( ES@@ A ) .
in December 2010 EU ministers in Brussels voted Prague in the Czech Republic as the headquarters of the Gal@@ il@@ e@@ o project .
on 21 October 2011 the first two of four operational satel@@ li@@ tes were launched to val@@ idate the system .
the next two followed on 12 October 2012 , making it " possible to test Gal@@ il@@ e@@ o end @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ end . "
once this In @@@ -@@ @ or@@ bit val@@ idation ( I@@ O@@ V ) phase has been completed , additional satel@@ li@@ tes will be launched to reach initial Oper@@ ational capability ( IOC ) around mid @@@ -@@ @ decade .
Gal@@ il@@ e@@ o is planned to provide a unique global search and rescue ( SA@@ R ) function .
at the same time , the system is projected to provide a signal to the users , in@@ forming them that their situation has been detec@@ ted and help is on the way .

the first stage of the Gal@@ il@@ e@@ o programme was agreed upon officially on 26 May 2003 by the European Union and the European Space Agency .
on 17 January 2002 a spokesman for the project stated that , as a result of US pressure and economic difficulties , " Gal@@ il@@ e@@ o is almost dead .
" a few months later , however , the situation changed dramatically .
the European Union and the European Space Agency agreed in March 2002 to fund the project , pending a review in 2003 ( which was completed on 26 May 2003 ) .
the required satel@@ li@@ tes ( the planned number is 30 ) were to be launched between 2011 and 2014 , with the system up and running and under civilian control from 20@@ 19 .
the final cost is estimated at € 3 billion , including the infrastructure on Earth , constructed in 2006 and 2007 .
the plan was for private companies and investors to invest at least two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of the cost of implementation , with the EU and ES@@ A dividing the remaining cost .
by early 2011 costs for the project had run 50 % over initial estimates .
the European Union also agreed to address the " mutual concerns related to the protection of al@@ lied and U@@ .S. national security capabilities .

in contrast to their g@@ lam metal con@@ tempor@@ aries in L@@ .@@ A. , they were seen as much more raw and dangerous .
the following year , Jan@@ e 's Ad@@ diction emerged from the same L@@ .@@ A. hard @@@ -@@ @ rock club scene with its major la@@ bel debut , " No@@ thing 's sho@@ cking . "
the group was one of the first to be identified with the " alternative metal " trend that would come to the fore in the next decade .
= = = = Th@@ ras@@ h metal = = = = Th@@ ras@@ h metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of hard@@ core pun@@ k and the New W@@ ave of British He@@ av@@ y Met@@ al , particularly songs in the rev@@ ved @@@ -@@ @ up style known as speed metal .
the sub@@ gen@@ re was popular@@ ized by the " Big F@@ our of Th@@ ras@@ h " : Metal@@ lica , An@@ th@@ ra@@ x , Meg@@ ade@@ th , and S@@ lay@@ er .
three German bands , Kre@@ ator , So@@ dom , and D@@ est@@ ru@@ ction , played a central role in bringing the style to Europe .

these two bands , along with De@@ ath and o@@ bi@@ tu@@ ary , were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da in the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1980s .
in the UK , the related style of gr@@ in@@ d@@ core , led by bands such as Nap@@ al@@ m De@@ ath and extreme no@@ ise Ter@@ ror , emerged from the an@@ ar@@ cho @@@ -@@ @ pun@@ k movement .
by the late 1980s , Norwegian bands such as may@@ hem and Bur@@ z@@ um were heading a second wave .
numerous black metal bands also " experim@@ ent with so@@ unds from all possible forms of metal , folk , classical music , electron@@ ica and av@@ ant @@@ -@@ @ gar@@ de . "

B@@ ath@@ ory inspired the Vik@@ ing metal and folk metal movements and Im@@ mort@@ al brought blast be@@ ats to the fore .
some bands in the S@@ cand@@ in@@ avian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s , with may@@ hem and Bur@@ z@@ um linked to church bur@@ nings .
according to former G@@ org@@ or@@ o@@ th vo@@ cal@@ ist G@@ a@@ ah@@ l , " Black Met@@ al was never meant to reach an audience ... had a common enemy which was , of course , Christi@@ an@@ ity , soci@@ alism and everything that democracy stands for .

traditional power metal bands like Sweden 's H@@ ammer@@ F@@ all , England 's Drag@@ on@@ Force , and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da 's I@@ ced Earth have a sound clearly indebted to the clas@@ sic N@@ W@@ O@@ BH@@ M style .

in this anal@@ o@@ gy , different notes correspon@@ d to different parti@@ c@@ les .
in str@@ ing theory , one of the mo@@ des of os@@ cil@@ lation of the str@@ ing correspon@@ ds to a mas@@ s@@ less , sp@@ in @@@ -@@ @ 2 parti@@ cle .
such a parti@@ cle is called a gra@@ vit@@ on since it medi@@ ates a force which has the properties of gra@@ vity .
since str@@ ing theory is believed to be a ma@@ them@@ atically consistent qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ical theory , the existence of this gra@@ vit@@ on state imp@@ lies that str@@ ing theory is a theory of qu@@ ant@@ um gra@@ vity .
the two types of str@@ ing be@@ have in slightly different ways , yi@@ el@@ ding different parti@@ cle types .
for example , all str@@ ing the@@ ories have closed str@@ ing gra@@ vit@@ on mo@@ des , but only open str@@ ings can correspon@@ d to the parti@@ c@@ les known as pho@@ t@@ ons .
because the two ends of an open str@@ ing can always meet and connect , forming a closed str@@ ing , all str@@ ing the@@ ories contain closed str@@ ings .
the ear@@ li@@ est str@@ ing model , the bos@@ onic str@@ ing , incorpor@@ ated only the class of parti@@ c@@ les known as bos@@ ons .
this model describes , at low enough ener@@ gies , a qu@@ ant@@ um gra@@ vity theory , which also includes ( if open str@@ ings are incorpor@@ ated as well ) ga@@ uge bos@@ ons such as the pho@@ ton .
what is most significant is that the theory has a fundamental instability , believed to result in the dec@@ ay ( at least partially ) of sp@@ ac@@ etime itself .
in addition , as the name imp@@ lies , the spectrum of parti@@ c@@ les contains only bos@@ ons , parti@@ c@@ les which , like the pho@@ ton , obe@@ y particular rules of behavi@@ or .

chron@@ ic lead exposure and lead @@@ -@@ @ cont@@ am@@ inated alcohol are risk factors for g@@ out due to the harmful effect of lead on kid@@ ney function .

other blood tests com@@ mon@@ ly performed are white blood cell count , elec@@ tr@@ ol@@ y@@ tes , ren@@ al function , and er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te se@@ di@@ ment@@ ation rate ( ES@@ R ) .
a white blood cell count as high as 4@@ 0.@@ 0 × 109 / l ( 40,000 / m@@ m@@ 3 ) has been documented .
this should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment .

a low @@@ -@@ @ cal@@ or@@ ie di@@ et in ob@@ ese men decreased ur@@ ic ac@@ id levels by 100 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ( 1.7 M@@ G / d@@ l ) .
coffee , but not tea , consumption is associated with a lower risk of g@@ out .
options for ac@@ ute treatment include non@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ al anti @@@ -@@ @ inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) , col@@ chic@@ ine , and ster@@ o@@ ids , while options for prevention include al@@ lop@@ ur@@ in@@ ol , fe@@ bu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , and prob@@ en@@ ec@@ id .
improvement may be seen within four hours , and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks .
they are not recommended , however , in those with certain other health problems , such as g@@ astro@@ in@@ test@@ inal ble@@ eding , ren@@ al failure , or heart failure .
U@@ rate @@@ -@@ @ lowering measures should be increased until ser@@ um ur@@ ic ac@@ id levels are below 300 @@@ -@@ @ 360 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ( 5.@@ 0 @@@ -@@ @ 6.@@ 0 M@@ G / d@@ l ) , and are continued inde@@ fin@@ itely .
in such cases , the alternative drug , fe@@ bu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , has been recommended .
those with g@@ out are at increased risk of hy@@ per@@ tension , di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes mel@@ lit@@ us , Met@@ abol@@ ic syn@@ dro@@ me , and ren@@ al and cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease , and thus are at increased risk of death .
this may be partly due to its association with ins@@ ul@@ in resistance and ob@@ es@@ ity , but some of the increased risk appears to be independent .
other forms of chron@@ ic ren@@ al dys@@ function may occur .
in men over the age of 30 and women over the age of 50 , pre@@ val@@ ence is 2 % .
in the United States , g@@ out is twice as likely in African American mal@@ es as it is in European Americans .
it has become common in China , Pol@@ y@@ nes@@ ia , and urban sub @@@ -@@ @ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa .
this has been attributed to se@@ as@@ onal changes in di@@ et , alcohol consumption , physical activity , and temper@@ ature .
hum@@ ans and other great ap@@ es do not have this ability , thus g@@ out is common .

for example , the defining test for bone mar@@ row or hem@@ at@@ op@@ o@@ i@@ etic stem cells ( H@@ SC@@ s ) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without H@@ SC@@ s .
in other words , they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the ad@@ ult body when given sufficient and necessary stimu@@ lation for a specific cell type .
nearly all research to date has made use of mo@@ use em@@ br@@ yon@@ ic stem cells ( m@@ ES ) or human em@@ br@@ yon@@ ic stem cells ( h@@ ES ) .
both have the essential stem cell character@@ isti@@ cs , yet they require very different environ@@ ments in order to maintain an un@@ differ@@ enti@@ ated state .

without op@@ ti@@ mal culture conditions or gen@@ etic manip@@ ulation , em@@ br@@ yon@@ ic stem cells will rapidly differ@@ enti@@ ate .
a human em@@ br@@ yon@@ ic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several trans@@ cri@@ ption factors and cell sur@@ face prote@@ ins .

the mo@@ lec@@ ular defin@@ ition of a stem cell includes many more prote@@ ins and continues to be a topic of research .

the first human trial was approved by the US Food and Dru@@ g Administration in January 2009 .
however , the human trial was not initiated until October 13 , 2010 in Atlanta for sp@@ inal injur@@ y victims .

the use of ad@@ ult stem cells in research and ther@@ ap@@ y is not as controversial as the use of em@@ br@@ yon@@ ic stem cells , because the production of ad@@ ult stem cells does not require the destruction of an em@@ br@@ yo .

the S@@ imp@@ sons is an American anim@@ ated sit@@ com created by Mat@@ t Gro@@ ening for the Fo@@ x Broadcasting Company .
the series is a s@@ ati@@ ri@@ cal depic@@ tion of a middle class American lif@@ estyle ep@@ it@@ om@@ ized by the S@@ imp@@ son family , which consists of Ho@@ mer , Mar@@ ge , Bar@@ t , Lis@@ a , and Mag@@ gi@@ e .
the show is set in the fic@@ tional town of Spr@@ ing@@ field and par@@ o@@ dies American culture , society , television , and many aspects of the human condition .
the family was conce@@ ived by Gro@@ ening shortly before a sol@@ ic@@ itation for a series of anim@@ ated shor@@ ts with the producer James L@@ . Bro@@ oks .
Gro@@ ening created a dys@@ functional family and named the charac@@ ters after members of his own family , sub@@ stitut@@ ing Bar@@ t for his own name .
the shor@@ ts became a part of " The T@@ rac@@ ey Ul@@ l@@ man Show " on April 19 , 1987 .
it has won dozens of awards since it de@@ bu@@ ted as a series , including 31 pri@@ me@@ time Em@@ my Awards , 30 An@@ ni@@ e Awards , and a Pe@@ ab@@ ody Award .
the S@@ imp@@ son family first appeared as shor@@ ts in " The T@@ rac@@ ey Ul@@ l@@ man Show " on April 19 , 1987 .
the anim@@ ation was produced dome@@ sti@@ cally at K@@ l@@ ask@@ y C@@ sup@@ o , with W@@ es Ar@@ cher , David Sil@@ ver@@ man , and Bill Kop@@ p being anim@@ ators for the first season .
Col@@ or@@ ist Gy@@ org@@ yi P@@ elu@@ ce was the person who decided to make the charac@@ ters yel@@ low .
in 1989 , a team of production companies adap@@ ted " The S@@ imp@@ sons " into a half @@@ -@@ @ hour series for the Fo@@ x Broadcasting Company .
the team included the K@@ l@@ ask@@ y C@@ sup@@ o anim@@ ation house .
" some en@@ chan@@ ted Even@@ ing " was the first full @@@ -@@ @ length ep@@ iso@@ de produced , but it did not broadcast until May 1990 , as the last ep@@ iso@@ de of the first season , because of anim@@ ation problems .
in 1992 , T@@ rac@@ ey Ul@@ l@@ man filed a lawsuit against Fo@@ x , claiming that her show was the source of the series ' success .
he was constantly at odds with Gro@@ ening , Bro@@ oks and the show 's production company G@@ rac@@ ie Fil@@ ms and left in 1993 .
the main writer of each ep@@ iso@@ de writes the first draft .
until 2004 , George Mey@@ er , who had developed the show since the first season , was active in these sessions .
each ep@@ iso@@ de takes six months to produce so the show rarely comments on current events .
English co@@ medi@@ an Ric@@ ky Ger@@ va@@ is wrote the ep@@ iso@@ de " Ho@@ mer S@@ imp@@ son , This Is Y@@ our W@@ ife , " becoming the first celebr@@ ity to both write and guest star in an ep@@ iso@@ de .
S@@ eth Ro@@ gen and E@@ van Gol@@ d@@ berg , writers of the film " Su@@ per@@ bad , " wrote the ep@@ iso@@ de " Ho@@ mer the W@@ hop@@ per , " with Ro@@ gen voicing a character in it .

Jul@@ ie Kav@@ ner speaks the voices of Mar@@ ge S@@ imp@@ son and Pat@@ ty and Sel@@ ma , as well as several minor charac@@ ters .
Cas@@ tel@@ lan@@ eta and Kav@@ ner had been a part of " The T@@ rac@@ ey Ul@@ l@@ man Show " cast and were given the parts so that new actors would not be needed .
C@@ art@@ wright performs the voices of Bar@@ t S@@ imp@@ son , Nel@@ son Mun@@ tz , R@@ alp@@ h W@@ ig@@ gu@@ m and other children .
S@@ mit@@ h , the voice of Lis@@ a S@@ imp@@ son , is the only cast member who regularly voices only one character , although she occasi@@ onally plays other ep@@ iso@@ dic charac@@ ters .
the producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bar@@ t and Lis@@ a .
S@@ mit@@ h had initially been asked to audi@@ tion for the role of Bar@@ t , but casting director Bon@@ ita Pi@@ eti@@ la believed her voice was too high , so she was given the role of Lis@@ a instead .
every main cast member has won a pri@@ me@@ time Em@@ my Award for O@@ ut@@ standing Voice @@@ -@@ @ Over Per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
both Fo@@ x and the production crew wanted to keep their identi@@ ties secret during the early se@@ as@@ ons and , therefore , closed most of the recor@@ ding sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recor@@ ding artists .
in addition to the main cast , Pa@@ me@@ la Hay@@ den , T@@ ress Mac@@ Ne@@ il@@ le , Mar@@ cia Wal@@ la@@ ce , Mag@@ gi@@ e Ros@@ well , and Rus@@ si Tay@@ lor voice supporting charac@@ ters .
from 1999 to 2002 , Ros@@ well 's charac@@ ters were voiced by Mar@@ cia Mit@@ z@@ man G@@ av@@ en .
repeat " special guest " cast members include Albert Bro@@ oks , P@@ hil Hart@@ man , J@@ on Lov@@ itz , Joe Man@@ te@@ gn@@ a , and K@@ else@@ y Gram@@ mer .
in the earlier se@@ as@@ ons , most of the guest stars voiced charac@@ ters , but eventually more started appe@@ aring as themselves .
Tony Ben@@ net@@ t was the first guest star to appear as himself , appe@@ aring brief@@ ly in the season two ep@@ iso@@ de " Dan@@ cin ' Ho@@ mer . "
it is also one of the few program@@ s dubbed in both standard French and Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c French .
for example , Ho@@ mer drin@@ ks so@@ da instead of beer and e@@ ats Egyptian be@@ ef sa@@ us@@ ages instead of hot do@@ gs .
throughout the run of the anim@@ ated shor@@ ts on " The T@@ rac@@ ey Ul@@ l@@ man Show , " the anim@@ ation was produced dome@@ sti@@ cally at K@@ l@@ ask@@ y C@@ sup@@ o .
in Se@@ ason 14 , production swit@@ ched from traditional cel anim@@ ation to digital ink and pain@@ t .
the first ep@@ iso@@ de to experim@@ ent with digital col@@ oring was " radio@@ active Man " in 1995 .
the already completed " Ten@@ nis the men@@ ace " was broadcast as made .
the series cen@@ ters on a family and their life in a typical American town , serving as a s@@ ati@@ ri@@ cal par@@ ody of a middle class American lif@@ estyle .
the town of Spr@@ ing@@ field acts as a complete uni@@ verse in which charac@@ ters can explore the issues faced by modern society .
by having Ho@@ mer work in a nuclear power plant , the show can comment on the state of the environment .
through Bar@@ t and Lis@@ a 's days at Spr@@ ing@@ field Ele@@ mentary School , the show 's writers illu@@ str@@ ate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education .
the town features a vast array of media channels - from kids ' television programming to local news , which enables the producers to make j@@ ok@@ es about themselves and the entertainment industry .
in " The S@@ imp@@ sons , " politicians are corrupt , ministers such as Re@@ ver@@ end Lov@@ e@@ joy are in@@ different to chur@@ ch@@ go@@ ers , and the local police force is in@@ competent .
in times of crisis , the family often turns to God , and the show has dealt with most of the major religions .
the cam@@ era then follows the members of the family on their way home .
the series ' distinc@@ tive theme song was composed by musician D@@ ann@@ y El@@ f@@ man in 1989 , after Gro@@ ening appro@@ ached him requ@@ esting a re@@ tro style piece .
these pieces usually involve the family in some hor@@ ror , science fic@@ tion , or super@@ natural setting and often par@@ ody or pay H@@ om@@ age to a famous piece of work in those gen@@ res .
such refer@@ ences , for example , come from movies , television , music , literature , science , and history .
the audience may often not no@@ tice the vis@@ ual j@@ ok@@ es in a single viewing .
" one of Bar@@ t 's early hal@@ l@@ marks was his p@@ rank calls to Mo@@ e 's T@@ aver@@ n owner Mo@@ e Sz@@ y@@ s@@ lak in which Bar@@ t calls Mo@@ e and asks for a ga@@ g name .
the most common form is j@@ ok@@ es about Fo@@ x Broadcasting .
however , Bar@@ t rarely used the latter two ph@@ ras@@ es until after they became popular through the mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ising .
Dan Cas@@ tel@@ lan@@ eta says he borro@@ wed the ph@@ r@@ ase from James Fin@@ lay@@ son , an actor in many Lau@@ rel and har@@ dy co@@ medi@@ es , who pronounced it in a more el@@ on@@ g@@ ated and wh@@ ining tone .
the ph@@ r@@ ase quickly spread to other journalists .
" I , for one , welcome our new in@@ sec@@ t over@@ lor@@ ds , " was used by Kent Bro@@ ck@@ man in " De@@ ep Space Ho@@ mer " and has become a common variety of ph@@ r@@ ase .

= = = Television = = = " The S@@ imp@@ sons " was the first successful anim@@ ated program in American prime time since " wait ti@@ ll Y@@ our F@@ ather Get@@ s Home " in the 197@@ 0s .
in 1990 , Bar@@ t quickly became one of the most popular charac@@ ters on television in what was termed " B@@ art@@ man@@ ia . "
in the early 1990s , millions of T @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ir@@ ts featuring Bar@@ t were sold ; as many as one million were sold on some days .
because of his popularity , Bar@@ t was often the most promoted member of the S@@ imp@@ son family in adverti@@ sem@@ ents for the show , even for ep@@ iso@@ des in which he was not involved in the main plot .
E@@ t on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday , where it would compete with " The Cos@@ by Show " on N@@ BC , the number one show at the time .
through the summer , several news outlets published stories about the supposed " Bill v@@ s@@ . Bar@@ t " ri@@ val@@ ry .
at the time , it was the most watched ep@@ iso@@ de in the history of the Fo@@ x Network , and it is still the highest rated ep@@ iso@@ de in the history of " The S@@ imp@@ sons . "
" in a 1990 review of the show , K@@ en T@@ uc@@ ker of " Enter@@ tain@@ ment We@@ ek@@ ly " described it as " the American family at its most complicated , drawn as simple car@@ to@@ ons .
" T@@ uc@@ ker would also describe the show as a " pop @@@ -@@ @ cultural phenomenon , a prime @@@ -@@ @ time car@@ toon show that appeals to the entire family .
Bar@@ t was the only fic@@ tional character on the list .
on January 14 , 2000 , the S@@ imp@@ sons were awarded a star on the Hollywood Wal@@ k of F@@ ame .
also in 2000 , " Enter@@ tain@@ ment We@@ ek@@ ly " magazine TV cri@@ tic K@@ en T@@ uc@@ ker named " The S@@ imp@@ sons " the greatest television show of the 1990s .
Ho@@ mer would also place ninth on " Enter@@ tain@@ ment We@@ ek@@ ly " list of the " 50 Gre@@ atest TV ic@@ ons . "
= = = Cri@@ ticism and controversy = = = Bar@@ t 's rebel@@ li@@ ous nature , which frequently resulted in no punishment for his mis@@ behavi@@ or , led some parents and conserv@@ atives to character@@ ize him as a poor role model for children .

most people are in a struggle to be normal he thinks normal is very bor@@ ing , and does things that others just w@@ ished they dare do .

Gro@@ ening was a fierce and vo@@ cal cri@@ tic of the ep@@ iso@@ de " A Star Is Burns " ( season six , 1995 ) which featured a cross@@ over with " The cri@@ tic . "
the ep@@ iso@@ de has been cri@@ ti@@ ciz@@ ed by Gro@@ ening and by Harry S@@ hear@@ er , who provides the voice of S@@ kin@@ ner .
in a 2001 interview , S@@ hear@@ er recalled that after reading the s@@ cri@@ pt , he told the writers , " That 's so wrong .
" Mik@@ e S@@ cul@@ ly , who was sho@@ wr@@ un@@ ner during se@@ as@@ ons nine through twelve , has been the subject of criticism .
in 2004 , Harry S@@ hear@@ er cri@@ ti@@ ciz@@ ed what he perceived as the show 's declining quality : " I rate the last three se@@ as@@ ons as among the worst , so Se@@ ason F@@ our looks very good to me now .
the anim@@ ation is incre@@ di@@ bly detailed and imag@@ in@@ ative , and the stories do things that we ha@@ ven '@@ t done before .

for a long time , difficulties such as lack of a su@@ itable story and an already fully engaged crew of writers delayed the project .

there are six types of quar@@ ks , known as " f@@ lav@@ ors " : up , down , st@@ range , char@@ m , top , and bottom .
up and down quar@@ ks have the lowest mas@@ ses of all quar@@ ks .
the he@@ avier quar@@ ks rapidly change into up and down quar@@ ks through a process of parti@@ cle dec@@ ay : the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state .
because of this , up and down quar@@ ks are generally stable and the most common in the uni@@ verse , whereas st@@ range , char@@ m , bottom , and top quar@@ ks can only be produced in high energy col@@ lis@@ ions ( such as those involving cos@@ m@@ ic r@@ ays and in parti@@ cle acceler@@ ators ) .
the quar@@ k model was independently proposed by physi@@ c@@ ists Mur@@ ray Gel@@ l @@@ -@@ @ Man@@ n and George Z@@ we@@ i@@ g in 19@@ 64 .
the first generation includes up and down quar@@ ks , the second st@@ range and char@@ m quar@@ ks , and the third bottom and top quar@@ ks .
all sear@@ ches for a fourth generation of quar@@ ks and other elementary fer@@ m@@ ions have failed , < / re@@ f > and there is strong indirect evidence that no more than three generations exist .
only first @@@ -@@ @ generation ( up and down ) quar@@ ks occur com@@ mon@@ ly in nature .
= = History = = The quar@@ k model was independently proposed by physi@@ c@@ ists Mur@@ ray Gel@@ l @@@ -@@ @ Man@@ n ( pic@@ tured ) and George Z@@ we@@ i@@ g in 19@@ 64 .
Gel@@ l @@@ -@@ @ Man@@ n and Z@@ we@@ i@@ g pos@@ ited that they were not elementary parti@@ c@@ les , but were instead composed of combin@@ ations of quar@@ ks and anti@@ quar@@ ks .
there was particular contention about whether the quar@@ k was a physical entity or a mere ab@@ str@@ action used to explain concep@@ ts that were not fully understood at the time .
in less than a year , exten@@ sions to the Gel@@ l @@@ -@@ @ Man@@ n @@@ -@@ @ Z@@ we@@ i@@ g model were proposed .
S@@ hel@@ don Le@@ e G@@ las@@ how and James B@@ j@@ or@@ ken predicted the existence of a fourth f@@ lav@@ or of quar@@ k , which they called " char@@ m . "
in 19@@ 68 , deep in@@ el@@ as@@ tic sc@@ at@@ tering experim@@ ents at the Stan@@ ford lin@@ e@@ ar acceler@@ ator Center ( S@@ L@@ A@@ C ) showed that the pro@@ ton contained much smaller , point @@@ -@@ @ like objects and was therefore not an elementary parti@@ cle .
the objects that were observed at S@@ L@@ A@@ C would later be identified as up and down quar@@ ks as the other f@@ lav@@ ors were discovered .
nevertheless , " par@@ ton " remains in use as a collective term for the constitu@@ ents of h@@ ad@@ r@@ ons ( quar@@ ks , anti@@ quar@@ ks , and g@@ lu@@ ons ) .
in a 1970 paper , G@@ las@@ how , John Ili@@ opoulos and Lu@@ ci@@ ano Mai@@ ani presented further reas@@ oning for the existence of the as @@@ -@@ @ yet un@@ discovered char@@ m quar@@ k .
the number of supposed quar@@ k f@@ lav@@ ors grew to the current six in 197@@ 3 , when Mak@@ o@@ to K@@ ob@@ ay@@ ashi and Tos@@ hi@@ hide M@@ ask@@ aw@@ a noted that the experim@@ ental ob@@ servation of C@@ P violation could be explained if there were another pair of quar@@ ks .
char@@ m quar@@ ks were produced almost simultaneously by two teams in November 1974 ( see November Revol@@ ution ) - one at S@@ L@@ A@@ C under Bur@@ ton Ric@@ hter , and one at Bro@@ ok@@ ha@@ ven National Lab@@ or@@ atory under Samuel T@@ ing .
the discovery finally convinced the physi@@ cs community of the quar@@ k model 's val@@ idity .
of these , the 19@@ 75 paper by H@@ aim Har@@ ari was the first to co@@ in the terms " top " and " bottom " for the additional quar@@ ks .
in 197@@ 7 , the bottom quar@@ k was observed by a team at Fer@@ mil@@ a@@ b led by Le@@ on L@@ eder@@ man .
the up and down quar@@ ks are named after the up and down components of is@@ os@@ pin , which they carry .
for example , the Had@@ ron constitu@@ ents of at@@ om@@ ic N@@ uc@@ le@@ i , neutr@@ ons and pro@@ t@@ ons , have charges of 0 and + 1 respectively ; the neut@@ ron is composed of two down quar@@ ks and one up quar@@ k , and the pro@@ ton of two up quar@@ ks and one down quar@@ k .
= = = sp@@ in = = = sp@@ in is an in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic property of elementary parti@@ c@@ les , and its direction is an important degree of freedom .
for quar@@ ks , a meas@@ urement of the sp@@ in v@@ ec@@ tor component along any ax@@ is can only yield the values + " ħ " / 2 or − " ħ " / 2 ; for this reason quar@@ ks are classified as sp@@ in@@ - parti@@ c@@ les .
for example , an up quar@@ k with a sp@@ in of + along the " Z " ax@@ is is den@@ oted by u ↑ .
= = = We@@ ak inter@@ action = = = A quar@@ k of one f@@ lav@@ or can transform into a quar@@ k of another f@@ lav@@ or only through the weak inter@@ action , one of the four fundamental inter@@ actions in parti@@ cle physi@@ cs .
the bos@@ on then dec@@ ays into an elec@@ tr@@ on and an elec@@ tr@@ on an@@ tin@@ e@@ ut@@ r@@ ino .
the relative ten@@ den@@ cies of all f@@ lav@@ or trans@@ form@@ ations are described by a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal table , called the Ca@@ bi@@ b@@ bo @@@ -@@ @ K@@ ob@@ ay@@ ashi @@@ -@@ @ M@@ ask@@ aw@@ a mat@@ ri@@ x ( C@@ K@@ M mat@@ ri@@ x ) .
there exists an equivalent weak inter@@ action mat@@ ri@@ x for le@@ p@@ t@@ ons ( right side of the W bos@@ on on the above Beta dec@@ ay di@@ ag@@ ram ) , called the Pon@@ tec@@ or@@ vo @@@ -@@ @ M@@ aki @@@ -@@ @ N@@ ak@@ ag@@ aw@@ a @@@ -@@ @ Sak@@ ata mat@@ ri@@ x ( P@@ M@@ NS mat@@ ri@@ x ) .
together , the C@@ K@@ M and P@@ M@@ NS mat@@ ri@@ ces describe all f@@ lav@@ or trans@@ form@@ ations , but the links between the two are not yet clear .
every quar@@ k carries a col@@ or , while every anti@@ quar@@ k carries an an@@ tic@@ ol@@ or .
similarly , the combination of three quar@@ ks , each with different col@@ or charges , or three anti@@ quar@@ ks , each with an@@ tic@@ ol@@ or charges , will result in the same " white " col@@ or charge and the formation of a bar@@ yon or anti@@ bar@@ yon .
col@@ or S@@ U ( 3 ) ( com@@ mon@@ ly ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ated to S@@ U ( 3 ) c ) is the ga@@ uge sym@@ me@@ try that rela@@ tes the col@@ or charge in quar@@ ks and is the defining sym@@ me@@ try for qu@@ ant@@ um ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics .
S@@ U ( 3 ) c col@@ or trans@@ form@@ ations correspon@@ d to " ro@@ tations " in col@@ or space ( which , ma@@ them@@ atically speaking , is a complex space ) .
these mas@@ ses typically have very different values .
while g@@ lu@@ ons are inher@@ ently mas@@ s@@ less , they poss@@ ess energy - more specifically , qu@@ ant@@ um ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics binding energy ( Q@@ CB@@ E ) - and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the Had@@ ron ( see mass in special rela@@ tivity ) .
the Standard Mo@@ del pos@@ its that elementary parti@@ c@@ les der@@ ive their mas@@ ses from the Hig@@ gs mechanism , which is related to the Hig@@ gs bos@@ on .
= = = T@@ able of properties = = = The following table sum@@ mar@@ iz@@ es the key properties of the six quar@@ ks .
the bar@@ yon number ( " B " ) is + for all quar@@ ks , as bar@@ y@@ ons are made of three quar@@ ks .
each g@@ lu@@ on carries one col@@ or charge and one an@@ tic@@ ol@@ or charge .
when a g@@ lu@@ on is transferred between quar@@ ks , a col@@ or change occur@@ s in both ; for example , if a red quar@@ k em@@ its a red @@@ -@@ @ anti@@ green g@@ lu@@ on , it becomes green , and if a green quar@@ k absor@@ bs a red @@@ -@@ @ anti@@ green g@@ lu@@ on , it becomes red .
therefore , while each quar@@ k 's col@@ or constantly changes , their strong inter@@ action is preserved .
above a certain energy threshold , p@@ airs of quar@@ ks and anti@@ quar@@ ks are created .
this process of h@@ ad@@ ron@@ ization occur@@ s before quar@@ ks , formed in a high energy col@@ lis@@ ion , are able to inter@@ act in any other way .
= = = Sea quar@@ ks = = = Had@@ r@@ ons , along with the " val@@ ence quar@@ ks " ( ) that contribute to their qu@@ ant@@ um numbers , contain virtual quar@@ k @@@ -@@ @ anti@@ quar@@ k ( ) p@@ airs known as " sea quar@@ ks " ( ) .

any theory that would allow time travel would introduce potential problems of ca@@ us@@ ality .
= = = Tourism in time = = = Stephen Haw@@ king has suggested that the absence of tourists from the future is an argument against the existence of time travel : this is a vari@@ ant of the Fer@@ mi par@@ ad@@ o@@ x .
however , in the case of a hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical signal moving faster than light , there would always be some fra@@ mes in which the signal was received before it was sent , so that the signal could be said to have moved back@@ ward in time .
according to special rela@@ tivity , it would take an in@@ fin@@ ite amount of energy to accelerate a s@@ lower @@@ -@@ @ than @@@ -@@ @ light object to the speed of light .
= = = Special sp@@ ac@@ etime geo@@ me@@ tries = = = The general theory of rela@@ tivity extends the special theory to cover gra@@ vity , illu@@ str@@ ating it in terms of cur@@ vat@@ ure in sp@@ ac@@ etime caused by mass @@@ -@@ @ energy and the flow of momentum .
this could provide an alternative explanation for Haw@@ king 's ob@@ servation : a time machine will be built some@@ day , but has not yet been built , so the tourists from the future can@@ not reach this far back in time .
more technically , the wor@@ m@@ hol@@ e sp@@ ac@@ etime requires a distribution of energy that viola@@ tes various energy conditions , such as the n@@ ul@@ l energy condition along with the weak , strong , and dominant energy conditions .
however , it is known that qu@@ ant@@ um effects can lead to small meas@@ ur@@ able violations of the n@@ ul@@ l energy condition , and many physi@@ c@@ ists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the Cas@@ imir effect in qu@@ ant@@ um physi@@ cs .
although early calc@@ ulations suggested a very large amount of negative energy would be required , later calc@@ ulations showed that the amount of negative energy can be made arbitr@@ arily small .
however , the den@@ s@@ ity and speed required is so great that ordinary matter is not strong enough to construct it .
a similar device might be built from a cos@@ m@@ ic str@@ ing , but none are known to exist , and it does not seem to be possible to create a new cos@@ m@@ ic str@@ ing .
physi@@ cist Robert For@@ ward noted that a na@@ ï@@ ve application of general rela@@ tivity to qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics suggests another way to build a time machine .
a heavy at@@ om@@ ic n@@ uc@@ le@@ us in a strong mag@@ ne@@ tic field would el@@ on@@ gate into a cy@@ lin@@ der , whose den@@ s@@ ity and " sp@@ in " are enough to build a time machine .
I can prove that to build a fin@@ ite time machine , you need negative energy .
N@@ im@@ tz told " New Scienti@@ st " magazine : " for the time being , this is the only violation of special rela@@ tivity that I know of .
Mal@@ let@@ t has some physical arguments that suggest that closed time@@ like cur@@ ves would become possible through the cen@@ ter of a las@@ er that has been tw@@ isted into a lo@@ op .
his experim@@ ent involved slow light as well as passing light through a vac@@ u@@ um .
he generated two single pho@@ t@@ ons , passing one through ru@@ bi@@ dium At@@ oms that had been co@@ o@@ led with a las@@ er ( thus slow@@ ing the light ) and passing one through a vac@@ u@@ um .
according to D@@ u , this imp@@ lies that there is no possibility of light traveling faster than " c " ( and , thus , violating ca@@ us@@ ality ) .
some members of the media took this as an indication of proof that time travel was impossible .
it has been calculated that , under general rela@@ tivity , a person could travel forward in time at a rate four times that of distant observers by resi@@ ding inside a sp@@ her@@ ical shel@@ l with a di@@ ame@@ ter of 5 meters and the mass of J@@ up@@ iter .
of course , squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ing the mass of a large plan@@ et into such a structure is not expected to be within our technological capabilities in the near future .
= = = Time perception = = = Time perception can be apparently sp@@ ed up for living organis@@ ms through hi@@ ber@@ nation , where the body temper@@ ature and Met@@ abol@@ ic rate of the cre@@ ature is reduced .
if a sub@@ at@@ om@@ ic parti@@ cle with a short lif@@ etime were to be observed lasting longer this would suggest it had trav@@ eled into the future at an accelerated rate .
Ever@@ et@@ t 's many @@@ -@@ @ wor@@ l@@ ds interpre@@ tation ( M@@ W@@ I ) of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics suggests that all possible qu@@ ant@@ um events can occur in mutually exclusive histor@@ ies .
these alter@@ nate , or parallel , histor@@ ies would form a bran@@ ching tree symbol@@ iz@@ ing all possible out@@ comes of any inter@@ action .
this concept is most often used in science @@@ -@@ @ fic@@ tion , but some physi@@ c@@ ists such as David De@@ ut@@ s@@ ch have suggested that if time travel is possible and the M@@ W@@ I is correct , then a time Tra@@ ve@@ ler should indeed end up in a different history than the one he started from .
and the physi@@ cist Al@@ len Ever@@ et@@ t argued that De@@ ut@@ s@@ ch 's approach " involves modi@@ fying fundamental principles of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics ; it certainly goes beyond simply adopting the M@@ W@@ I . "
Daniel Gre@@ en@@ ber@@ ger and Kar@@ l S@@ voz@@ il proposed that qu@@ ant@@ um theory gives a model for time travel without par@@ ad@@ ox@@ es .
this effect was referred to as " sp@@ o@@ ok@@ y action at a distance " by E@@ in@@ stein .
nevertheless , the fact that ca@@ us@@ ality is preserved in qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics is a rigor@@ ous result in modern qu@@ ant@@ um field the@@ ories , and therefore modern the@@ ories do not allow for time travel or F@@ T@@ L communication .
in any specific instance where F@@ T@@ L has been claimed , more detailed analysis has proven that to get a signal , some form of classical communication must also be used .
compared to other fundamental concep@@ ts in modern physi@@ cs , time is still not understood very well .
phil@@ osoph@@ ers have been the@@ or@@ iz@@ ing about the nature of time since before the era of the ancient Greek phil@@ osoph@@ ers .
some phil@@ osoph@@ ers and physi@@ c@@ ists who study the nature of time also study the possibility of time travel and its logical implications .
for more information on the phil@@ osoph@@ ical consider@@ ations of time travel , cons@@ ult the work of David Le@@ w@@ is .
for more information on physi@@ cs @@@ -@@ @ related the@@ ories of time travel , consider the work of Kur@@ t Gö@@ del ( especially his the@@ or@@ ized uni@@ verse ) and Lawrence Sk@@ lar .
this would mean that time is just another dimension , that future events are " already there , " and that there is no objective flow of time .
this view is disputed by Ti@@ m M@@ au@@ d@@ lin in his " The Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sics With@@ in P@@ hy@@ sics . "
in this view , time travel is impossible because there is no future or past to travel to .

it was founded on May 9 , 19@@ 50 , by the " In@@ stitu@@ to Nac@@ i@@ onal de Industri@@ a " ( IN@@ I ) , a state @@@ -@@ @ owned industrial holding company .
it is currently a wh@@ ol@@ ly owned subsidiary of the German Volk@@ sw@@ ag@@ en Group , as a member of the now @@@ -@@ @ def@@ un@@ ct Au@@ di Br@@ and Group , together with Au@@ di and Lam@@ bor@@ gh@@ ini , and mar@@ ke@@ ted as a car maker with a you@@ th@@ ful spor@@ ty profile .
the headquarters of seat , S@@ .@@ A. are located at seat 's industrial complex in Mar@@ to@@ rell near Barcelona , Spain .
its headquarters and main manufacturing facilities are located in Mar@@ to@@ rell , an industrial town located some 30 kilo@@ metres northwest of Barcelona , with a production capacity of around 500,000 units per ann@@ um .
the plant was opened by King Ju@@ an Carlos of Spain on February 22 , 1993 , and replaced seat 's former assembly plant by the coast in Barcelona 's fre@@ e@@ port zone ( Z@@ ona Fran@@ ca ) .

its core market remains Europe , while the most successful market outside of Europe in terms of sales for seat is currently Mexico , where the company has deal@@ er presence in 27 Mex@@ ic@@ an states .
some of its cars have been sold outside Europe , bran@@ ded as Volk@@ sw@@ ag@@ ens , such as the seat I@@ biz@@ a hat@@ ch@@ back , known in South Africa as the Volk@@ sw@@ ag@@ en Pol@@ o Pla@@ ya , the seat In@@ ca panel van as the Volk@@ sw@@ ag@@ en Cad@@ dy , or the seat C@@ ó@@ r@@ do@@ ba , also known as the Volk@@ sw@@ ag@@ en Pol@@ o Clas@@ sic .
the situation greatly deteriorated with the Spanish Civil War of 19@@ 36 to 19@@ 39 .
the lack of interest shown by the foreign firms in the weak@@ ened post civil war Spanish market opened an opportunity for local interests .
Fiat 's collaboration with the French company Sim@@ ca proved Fiat 's ability to manage complex international projects .
in Italy , Fiat dominated the market for vehicles under 12 hor@@ se@@ power , which would initially be the main market segment in Spain .
the first car in the mar@@ que 's history to be produced was a seat 1@@ 400 model that came off the production line on November 13 , 19@@ 53 with licence pla@@ te ' B @@@ -@@ @ 8@@ 7.@@ 2@@ 23 ' .
on December 6 , 1967 , seat also founded its own cust@@ o@@ mer financing company ' Finan@@ ci@@ era seat , S@@ .@@ A. ' ( Fis@@ eat ) .
to be able to produce independently its own research projects , seat on November 16 , 1970 came in accordance with Fiat so as to start building separate inf@@ rastruc@@ tures aiming at developing new technologies .
the 197@@ 0s were a decade of rising prosperity in Spain , which is reflected in the announcement in August 197@@ 6 that seat would commen@@ ce local production of the Lan@@ cia Beta .
the launch of this model though sparked a lawsuit from Fiat against seat , as the former claimed the car was too similar to a car in Fiat 's range , the R@@ it@@ mo .
however , the Spanish authorities had already started talks with other foreign firms such as To@@ yo@@ ta , Nis@@ san and Mit@@ sub@@ is@@ hi in order to choose a strong partner for seat .
seat launched its new I@@ biz@@ a , a Gi@@ u@@ gi@@ ar@@ o st@@ y@@ led hat@@ ch@@ back which made use of System Por@@ sche eng@@ ines and also featured under@@ pin@@ nings from the Fiat R@@ it@@ mo / Stra@@ da , in 1984 .
it also formed the basis of the Mal@@ aga , a four @@@ -@@ @ door family sal@@ o@@ on .
in December 1990 the Volk@@ sw@@ ag@@ en Group acquired 9@@ 9.@@ 99 % ownership of the company , thus making seat the first non @@@ -@@ @ German wh@@ ol@@ ly owned subsidiary of the Group .
the first cars that rol@@ led out of the Mar@@ to@@ rell plant production lines were the seat I@@ biz@@ a M@@ k@@ 2 and its sal@@ o@@ on version , the seat C@@ ó@@ r@@ do@@ ba M@@ k@@ 1 .
the first time a seat model was manufac@@ tured out of Spain was in 1996 , with the production of the seat Al@@ ham@@ br@@ a M@@ k@@ 1 in the Pal@@ me@@ la Aut@@ o@@ Europ@@ a plant in Portugal .
also on January 1997 it was the first time when a non @@@ -@@ @ Spanish des@@ cen@@ d@@ ant , the Belgian Pierre @@@ -@@ @ Ala@@ in de S@@ med@@ t , was ever appointed seat 's chairman .
next year on July 1 , 2000 Dr. Ber@@ nd Peter P@@ is@@ ch@@ et@@ s@@ ri@@ eder , the former Chief Executive Offic@@ er of B@@ MW , was appointed to head seat .
in the spring of 2002 as P@@ is@@ ch@@ et@@ s@@ ri@@ eder was commissioned to chair the entire Volk@@ sw@@ ag@@ en Group , he gave way to his German comp@@ at@@ riot Andreas Sch@@ le@@ ef on March 7 , 2002 .
the I@@ biz@@ a allowed the company to further evol@@ ve its ral@@ lying experience , and was officially engaged in some European national championships .

A@@ dam Op@@ el AG ( Op@@ el ) is a German autom@@ obile manufacturer head@@ quar@@ tered in R@@ üs@@ sel@@ she@@ im , H@@ es@@ se , Germany , and a subsidiary of General Mot@@ ors Company .
= = History = = = = = 18@@ 62 @@@ -@@ @ 19@@ 20 = = = The company was founded in R@@ üs@@ sel@@ she@@ im , H@@ ess@@ en , Germany , on January 21 , 18@@ 62 , by A@@ dam Op@@ el .
because of the quick growth of his business , in 18@@ 88 the production was re@@ located from the co@@ w@@ shed to a more sp@@ ac@@ ious building in R@@ üs@@ sel@@ she@@ im .
in 19@@ 11 , the company 's factory was virtually destroyed by fire and a new one was built with more up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date machinery .
by 19@@ 14 , Op@@ el had become the largest German manufacturer of motor vehicles .
the La@@ ub@@ f@@ ros@@ ch was finished exclusively in green la@@ c@@ qu@@ er .
A@@ dam Op@@ el led the way for motor@@ ized transportation to become not just a means for the rich , but a reliable way for people of all classes to travel .
Op@@ el had a 3@@ 7.5 % market share in Germany and was also the country 's largest autom@@ obile exporter in 19@@ 28 .
this was based on the popular Op@@ el " P@@ 4 " model .
they called the car , launched in 19@@ 35 , the Olymp@@ ia .
Op@@ el receives a pat@@ ent which is considered one of the most important innov@@ ations in automo@@ tive history .
19@@ 39 saw the presentation of the highly successful Kap@@ it@@ ä@@ n .
in spite of sti@@ f@@ ling red tape , the economic atmosphere in Germany in the 19@@ 30@@ s had power@@ fully fer@@ tili@@ z@@ ed the growth of this and other auto companies .
one of the most vers@@ ati@@ le small German military vehicles , the K@@ et@@ ten@@ k@@ ra@@ d , a b@@ lend of tr@@ actor and motor@@ cycle , was pow@@ ered with a 1.4 L Olymp@@ ia four @@@ -@@ @ cy@@ lin@@ der engine .
to meet this demand , Op@@ el engineers developed an unusual vari@@ ation on normal co@@ ol@@ ing for the 3.6 L truck engine .
of this interesting engine , which developed at 3,000 r@@ pm on 74 @@@ -@@ @ oc@@ tane fuel , only three examples were built .
other special jobs were undertaken at the R@@ üs@@ sel@@ she@@ im factory .
with work like this going on , Germany 's enem@@ ies n@@ atur@@ ally took note of the various Op@@ el plants and , starting in August 19@@ 44 , began att@@ acking them by air .
never was the outlook more ble@@ ak at A@@ dam Op@@ el AG than in the first months of 1945 .
cars as well as truck production lines were lost by Op@@ el .
as re@@ par@@ ations for war destruction , under plans of the Allied Forces , the Soviet Union asked the Allied Military Government for the tools , j@@ ig@@ s , dies , fi@@ x@@ tures , and dra@@ w@@ ings for the K@@ ade@@ t@@ t .
just a year later a new Soviet car , the Mos@@ k@@ vit@@ ch 400 , rol@@ led off a Moscow assembly line .
not until 19@@ 59 was a Mos@@ k@@ vit@@ ch model introduced that b@@ ore no tr@@ ace of Op@@ el engineering .
and by that time , Op@@ el was just about ready to introduce a new K@@ ade@@ t@@ t of its own .
but this ruling did not end our interest in , or responsibility for , the Op@@ el property .
one resource that did not appear on the books of General Mot@@ ors or on the rol@@ ls of the occup@@ ying authorities was most responsible for the recovery of Op@@ el in 1945 : the collabor@@ ative nature of its workers .
by May 1945 , this work had advanced enough to allow the beginning of production of desper@@ ately needed Op@@ el parts .
it was a minor mir@@ acle that even this was possible .
by January 19@@ 46 , the plant itself was ready to build trucks but many of the almost 12,000 parts needed to make each one were lacking .
overcoming these and other obstacles , Op@@ el finally celebrated the completion of the first pos@@ tw@@ ar Op@@ el B@@ lit@@ z truck on 15 July 19@@ 46 in the presence of U@@ .S. Army General Geoffrey K@@ eyes and other local leaders and press reporters .
with a ceremon@@ ial b@@ ou@@ qu@@ et of flowers flying from its re@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ view mir@@ ror , this historic Op@@ el B@@ lit@@ z left the factory gate bound for a buyer in Wi@@ es@@ ba@@ den on 26 July .
further production followed at a rate of 150 a month , and by the end of 19@@ 46 the production total was 8@@ 39 .
Fri@@ gi@@ daire ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ators were also being made at R@@ üs@@ sel@@ she@@ im , as were Olymp@@ ia eng@@ ines for the N@@ S@@ U K@@ et@@ ten@@ k@@ ra@@ d .
but occupation regulations restricted German civilians to cars of 1.5 L or less , which made the Olymp@@ ia the obvious candidate .
under Dr. IN@@ G e@@ .h@@ . Kar@@ l Sti@@ ef , who had been chief engine@@ er at Op@@ el since 19@@ 34 , useful changes were made to this tough little car .
announced in November 19@@ 47 , production of the post @@@ -@@ @ war Olymp@@ ia , with a@@ ust@@ ere pain@@ ted h@@ ub@@ cap@@ s , began in December 19@@ 48 and allowed a modest return to export sales in that year .
prices in 19@@ 48 were 9@@ 9@@ 50 D@@ M for the Kap@@ itan and 6,@@ 7@@ 85 D@@ M for the Olymp@@ ia ( the De@@ ut@@ sch@@ mark having replaced the Re@@ ich@@ s@@ mark on 20 June 19@@ 48 ) .
in February and March , a G@@ M study group came to Germany to investigate every aspect of Europe 's economic situation and Op@@ el 's special problems .
on their return they submitted a report , on March 26 , recommen@@ ding that General Mot@@ ors resume control of Op@@ el .
such executives as Alfred P@@ . S@@ loan J@@ r . , and Charles Wilson , G@@ M 's President , then were considering the options .
S@@ loan set other important goals : " General Mot@@ ors should risk no additional capital in Op@@ el .
at last , the official word was released on 1 November 19@@ 48 : G@@ M resumed management control of A@@ dam Op@@ el AG .
the appointment of Z@@ d@@ un@@ ek to this post was a move of special significance .
he continued in that critical position until 19@@ 61 .
the c@@ abri@@ o @@@ -@@ @ coach model was returned to the Olymp@@ ia range and a Kom@@ bi was also offered , built by Kar@@ os@@ ser@@ ie Mi@@ es@@ en .
bigger changes were sav@@ ed for March 19@@ 51 , to anticipate the opening of the doors of the Frankfurt show on April 19 for an 11 @@@ -@@ @ day run .
this was a position that was not un@@ familiar to both G@@ M and Op@@ el , and one in which it did amaz@@ ingly well .
Op@@ el 's first tur@@ bo@@ charged car was the Op@@ el Rek@@ or@@ d 2.3 T@@ D , first shown at Geneva in March 1984 .

so Op@@ el is in most cases fully responsible for all the car architec@@ tures and technologies up to the Op@@ el in@@ sign@@ ia / Bu@@ ick Re@@ gal .
in particular , all the future @@@ -@@ @ oriented , modern , full @@@ -@@ @ efficient G@@ M architec@@ tures for comp@@ act vehicles are developed by Op@@ el .

hence star@@ bur@@ st activity usually lasts for only about ten million years , a relatively brief period in the history of a Gal@@ ax@@ y .
Star@@ bur@@ st gal@@ ax@@ ies are character@@ ized by du@@ st@@ y concentr@@ ations of gas and the appearance of newly formed stars , including massive stars that ion@@ ize the surrounding cl@@ ou@@ ds to create H II regions .

these pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al structures would eventually become the gal@@ ax@@ ies we see today .

during the following two billion years , the acc@@ um@@ ulated matter sett@@ les into a Gal@@ ac@@ tic dis@@ c .

when this was refused , he mar@@ ched on the city with eight le@@ gi@@ ons .

together with Lu@@ ci@@ us Anton@@ i@@ us , she raised an army in Italy to fight for Anton@@ y 's rights against Oc@@ tav@@ ian .
Lu@@ ci@@ us and his allies ended up in a defen@@ sive siege at Per@@ u@@ sia ( modern Per@@ ug@@ ia ) , where Oc@@ tav@@ ian forced them into surrender in early 40 BC .
Lu@@ ci@@ us and his army were spar@@ ed , due to his kin@@ ship with Anton@@ y , the stron@@ g@@ man of the East , while Ful@@ via was ex@@ iled to Sic@@ yon .

on the other hand , C@@ le@@ op@@ at@@ ra could restore his army to full strength , and since he already was engaged in a roman@@ tic affair with her , he decided to send Oc@@ tav@@ ia back to Rome .
mar@@ ching into Rome , Oc@@ tav@@ ian and Mar@@ cus Agri@@ p@@ pa were elected as dual consul@@ s by the Senate .
years of civil war had left Rome in a state of near law@@ les@@ s@@ ness , but the Republic was not prepared to accept the control of Oc@@ tav@@ ian as a desp@@ ot .

according to H@@ . H@@ . S@@ cul@@ lar@@ d , however , Aug@@ ust@@ us 's power was based on the exercise of " a pre@@ dominant military power and ... the ultimate san@@ ction of his authority was force , however much the fact was dis@@ gu@@ ised .
Oc@@ tav@@ ian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces , but did not have sole monopoly on political and mar@@ tial power .
the Senate still controlled North Africa , an important regional producer of gra@@ in , as well as Illyri@@ a and Macedonia , two mar@@ tially strategic regions with several le@@ gi@@ ons .
it was a title of religious rather than political authority .
Aug@@ ust@@ us also st@@ y@@ led himself as " Im@@ per@@ ator Ca@@ es@@ ar di@@ vi fil@@ i@@ us , " " Commander Ca@@ es@@ ar son of the de@@ ified one . "
with this title he not only bo@@ asted his fam@@ il@@ ial link to de@@ ified Jul@@ i@@ us Ca@@ es@@ ar , but the use of " Im@@ per@@ ator " sig@@ ni@@ fied a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory .
the word " Ca@@ es@@ ar " was mer@@ ely a co@@ g@@ no@@ men for one branch of the Jul@@ ian family , yet Aug@@ ust@@ us transformed " Ca@@ es@@ ar " into a new family line that began with him .
this was a surprise to many who believed Aug@@ ust@@ us would have named an he@@ ir to his position as an unofficial em@@ per@@ or .
legally it was closed to patri@@ cians , a status that Aug@@ ust@@ us had acquired years ago when adopted by Jul@@ i@@ us Ca@@ es@@ ar .
when Aug@@ ust@@ us failed to stand for election as consu@@ l in 22 BC , fears ar@@ ose once again that Aug@@ ust@@ us was being forced from power by the ar@@ ist@@ o@@ cratic Senate .
in 22 , 21 , and 19 BC , the people ri@@ oted in response , and only allowed a single consu@@ l to be elected for each of those years , os@@ ten@@ sibly to leave the other position open for Aug@@ ust@@ us .

after the reign of the client king Her@@ od the Great ( 73 @@@ -@@ @ 4 BC ) , Ju@@ de@@ a was added to the province of Syria when Aug@@ ust@@ us de@@ posed his successor Her@@ od Ar@@ che@@ laus .
like Egypt , which had been conqu@@ ered after the defeat of Anton@@ y in 30 BC , Syria was govern@@ ed not by a pro@@ consu@@ l or leg@@ ate of Aug@@ ust@@ us , but a high pre@@ f@@ ect of the equ@@ es@@ tri@@ an class .
when the rebel@@ li@@ ous tri@@ bes of Can@@ t@@ abri@@ a in modern @@@ -@@ @ day Spain were finally qu@@ elled in 19 BC , the territory fell under the provinces of His@@ pan@@ ia and L@@ us@@ it@@ ania .
the poet Hor@@ ace dedicated an o@@ de to the victory , while the monument Tro@@ phy of Aug@@ ust@@ us near Mon@@ aco was built to hon@@ or the occasion .
the Roman general German@@ ic@@ us took advantage of a Cher@@ us@@ ci civil war between Ar@@ min@@ i@@ us and S@@ eg@@ es@@ tes ; they defeated Ar@@ min@@ i@@ us , who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to t@@ reac@@ her@@ y .

while Dr@@ us@@ us ' marriage to Anton@@ ia was considered an un@@ break@@ able affair , V@@ ip@@ san@@ ia was " only " the daughter of the late Agri@@ p@@ pa from his first marriage .
this continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of he@@ ir@@ s .

nevertheless , his legacy proved more en@@ during .
the city of Rome was ut@@ ter@@ ly transformed under Aug@@ ust@@ us , with Rome 's first institu@@ tion@@ al@@ ized police force , fire fighting force , and the establishment of the municipal pre@@ f@@ ect as a permanent office .
a " pra@@ ef@@ ec@@ tus vig@@ il@@ um , " or " P@@ ref@@ ect of the Watch " was put in charge of the vig@@ il@@ es , Rome 's fire brigade and police .
with Rome 's civil wars at an end , Aug@@ ust@@ us was also able to create a standing army for the Roman Empire , fixed at a size of 28 le@@ gi@@ ons of about 17@@ 0,000 soldiers .
in the year 6 Aug@@ ust@@ us established the " a@@ er@@ ar@@ ium milit@@ are , " don@@ ating 170 million ses@@ ter@@ ces to the new military treas@@ ury that provided for both active and retired soldiers .
although the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire , Aug@@ ust@@ us w@@ ished to em@@ body the spirit of Republican vir@@ tu@@ e and norms .
in the year 29 BC , Aug@@ ust@@ us paid 400 ses@@ ter@@ ces each to 250,000 citizens , 1,000 ses@@ ter@@ ces each to 120,000 veterans in the col@@ on@@ ies , and spent 700 million ses@@ ter@@ ces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon .
as T@@ ac@@ it@@ us wrote , the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Pr@@ in@@ cip@@ ate .
had Aug@@ ust@@ us died earlier ( in 23 BC , for instance ) , matters might have turned out differ@@ ently .

the relief sculptures decor@@ ating the Ar@@ a Pac@@ is vis@@ ually a@@ ug@@ mented the written record of Aug@@ ust@@ us ' tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s in the " R@@ ES G@@ es@@ ta@@ e . "
he also built the Tem@@ ple of Ca@@ es@@ ar , the ba@@ ths of Agri@@ p@@ pa , and the Forum of Aug@@ ust@@ us with its Tem@@ ple of Mar@@ s Ul@@ tor .
to celebrate his victory at the B@@ attle of Ac@@ ti@@ um , the Ar@@ ch of Aug@@ ust@@ us was built in 29 BC near the entrance of the Tem@@ ple of Cas@@ tor and Pol@@ lu@@ x , and wi@@ dened in 19 BC to include a triple @@@ -@@ @ arch design .

the African ele@@ ph@@ ant was first named by German n@@ atur@@ alist Johan@@ n Fri@@ ed@@ rich B@@ lum@@ en@@ b@@ ach in 17@@ 97 as " Ele@@ p@@ has af@@ ri@@ c@@ ana . "
a 2000 study argued for the ele@@ vation of the two forms into separate species ( " L@@ . af@@ ri@@ c@@ ana " and " L@@ . cy@@ clo@@ tis " respectively ) based on differences in s@@ kul@@ l mor@@ ph@@ ology .
the p@@ y@@ g@@ my ele@@ ph@@ ants of the Con@@ go Bas@@ in , which have been suggested to be a separate species ( " Lo@@ x@@ od@@ on@@ ta pum@@ ili@@ o " ) are probably forest ele@@ ph@@ ants whose small size and / or early maturity are due to environmental conditions .
these animals were relatively small and aqu@@ atic .
the second radi@@ ation was represented by the emer@@ gence of the g@@ om@@ pho@@ ther@@ es in the Mi@@ o@@ cen@@ e , which likely evol@@ ved from " Er@@ it@@ re@@ um " and origin@@ ated in Africa , spreading to every continent except Australia and An@@ tar@@ c@@ tica .

= = = Communication = = = tou@@ ching is an important form of communication among ele@@ ph@@ ants .
Inf@@ ras@@ onic calls are important , particularly for long @@@ -@@ @ distance communication , in both Asian and African ele@@ ph@@ ants .
one study of a cap@@ tive female Asian ele@@ ph@@ ant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distingu@@ ishing between several vis@@ ual and some ac@@ ous@@ tic discrimination p@@ airs .
ele@@ ph@@ ants are among the species known to use tools .
in 1979 , Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3 million ele@@ ph@@ ants , with a possible up@@ per limit of 3.@@ 0 million .
by 1989 , the population was estimated to be 6@@ 0@@ 9,000 ; with 2@@ 7@@ 7,000 in Central Africa , 1@@ 10,000 in eastern Africa , 20@@ 4,000 in southern Africa , and 19@@ ,000 in western Africa .
about 2@@ 14,000 ele@@ ph@@ ants were estimated to live in the ra@@ in@@ forests , fewer than had previously been thought .
African ele@@ ph@@ ants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found , but 70 % of their range exists outside protected areas .
successful conserv@@ ation efforts in certain areas have led to high population den@@ si@@ ties .
in 1989 , the African ele@@ ph@@ ant was listed under ap@@ pen@@ di@@ x I by the Convention on International Trade in En@@ dan@@ gered Spec@@ ies of W@@ ild fa@@ una and F@@ l@@ ora ( cites ) , making trade illegal .
in some countries , sport hun@@ ting of the animals is legal ; Bot@@ sw@@ ana , Cam@@ ero@@ on , G@@ ab@@ on , Mo@@ zam@@ bi@@ que , Nam@@ i@@ bia , South Africa , Tan@@ zan@@ ia , Z@@ ambi@@ a , and Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we have cites export quotas for ele@@ ph@@ ant Tro@@ p@@ hi@@ es .
it is now ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t in these areas , and the current range of Asian ele@@ ph@@ ants is highly frag@@ mented .
it is likely that around half of the population is in India .
this prompted international bans on Iv@@ ory imports , starting with the United States in June 1989 , and followed by bans in other North American countries , western European countries , and Japan .
around the same time , Kenya destroyed all its Iv@@ ory sto@@ cks .
by contrast , Japan and Hong Kong , which were also part of the industry , were able to adap@@ t and were not badly affected .
in January 2012 , hundreds of ele@@ ph@@ ants in Bou@@ ba N@@ j@@ ida National Park , Cam@@ ero@@ on , were killed by Cha@@ dian Ra@@ id@@ ers .
still , members of the species have been killed for their Iv@@ ory in some areas , such as Per@@ iy@@ ar National Park in India .
the Asian ele@@ ph@@ ant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations .
in northern Tha@@ il@@ and , the animals are used to di@@ gest coffee be@@ ans for Black Iv@@ ory coffee .
from South Asia , the use of ele@@ ph@@ ants in war@@ fare spread west to Per@@ sia and east to Southeast Asia .
from then on , war ele@@ ph@@ ants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period .
= = = Zo@@ os and cir@@ cus@@ es = = = Ele@@ ph@@ ants were histor@@ ically kept for display in the men@@ ag@@ eries of An@@ cient Egypt , China , Greece and Rome .
in the modern era , ele@@ ph@@ ants have traditionally been a major part of z@@ o@@ os and cir@@ cus@@ es around the world .
the most famous cir@@ cus ele@@ ph@@ ant was probably J@@ umb@@ o ( 18@@ 61 - 15 September 18@@ 85 ) , who was a major attraction in the Bar@@ n@@ um & B@@ ail@@ ey C@@ ir@@ cus .
as of 2000 , around 1,200 Asian and 700 African ele@@ ph@@ ants were kept in z@@ o@@ os and cir@@ cus@@ es .
the largest cap@@ tive population is in North America , which has an estimated 3@@ 70 Asian and 350 African ele@@ ph@@ ants .
about 380 Asi@@ ans and 19@@ 0 Afri@@ c@@ ans are known to exist in Europe , and Japan has around 70 Asi@@ ans and 67 Afri@@ c@@ ans .
critics claim that the animals in z@@ o@@ os are under physical and mental stress .
F@@ eld stated that these practices are necessary to protect cir@@ cus workers and acknowledged that an ele@@ ph@@ ant tra@@ iner was re@@ pri@@ man@@ ded for using an electric shock device , known as a hot shot or electric pro@@ d , on an ele@@ ph@@ ant .
in 2012 , two ele@@ ph@@ ants in T@@ ete d '@@ O@@ r z@@ oo , L@@ yon were diagnos@@ ed with the disease .
because of the timing , these attacks have been interpreted as v@@ indic@@ tive .
in India , male ele@@ ph@@ ants regularly enter villages at night , destroying homes and killing people .
ele@@ ph@@ ants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand , while in As@@ sam 2@@ 39 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006 .
local people have reported their belief that some ele@@ ph@@ ants were dr@@ un@@ k during their attacks , although officials have disputed this explanation .
pur@@ por@@ tedly dr@@ un@@ k ele@@ ph@@ ants attacked an Indian village a second time in December 2002 , killing six people , which led to the killing of about 200 ele@@ ph@@ ants by locals .
Africa in particular contains many rock paintings and en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of the animals , especially in the Sa@@ har@@ a and southern Africa .
in the F@@ ar East , the animals are depic@@ ted as mo@@ tif@@ s in Hin@@ du and Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ist shr@@ ines and temp@@ les .
ele@@ ph@@ ants have been the subject of religious beli@@ efs .
the animals ' religious importance is only to@@ tem@@ ic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia .
one of the most important Hin@@ du de@@ ities , the ele@@ ph@@ ant @@@ -@@ @ headed Gan@@ es@@ ha , is ranked equal with the sup@@ re@@ me go@@ ds Shi@@ va , Vis@@ hn@@ u , and Bra@@ h@@ ma .

am@@ id@@ st the world financial crisis in the fall of 2008 , reports emerged that Ford was con@@ tem@@ pla@@ ting a sale of its stake in Maz@@ da as a way of stream@@ lining its asset base .

his aim was to create a party and a movement which would promote Islamic values and eth@@ ics , political awareness , combat secularism , and create an Islamic state in Iraq .
this came at a time when politics in Iraq was dominated by secularist Arab nationalist and socialist ideas .
one of their main goals was to destroy Saddam .

these structures , for Al@@ th@@ us@@ ser , are both agents of re@@ pression and inevitable : it is impossible to escape ideology and avoid being subj@@ ected to it .
Mar@@ x 's theory seems to pos@@ it a system in which an im@@ balance in two parts could lead to compen@@ sat@@ ory adjustments at other levels , or sometimes to a major re@@ organisation of the whole .
to develop this idea , Al@@ th@@ us@@ ser reli@@ es on the concep@@ ts of con@@ tradi@@ ction and non @@@ -@@ @ con@@ tradi@@ ction , which he claims are ill@@ umin@@ ated by their relation to a complex struc@@ tured whole .
Al@@ th@@ us@@ ser elabor@@ ates on these concep@@ ts by reference to L@@ enin 's analysis of the Russian Revol@@ ution of 19@@ 17 .
the differences between events in Russia and Western Europe highlight that a con@@ tradi@@ ction between forces and relations of production may be necessary , but not sufficient , to bring about revolution .
to emphasise that changes in social structures rela@@ te to numerous contra@@ dic@@ tions , Al@@ th@@ us@@ ser describes these changes as " over@@ determined , " using a term taken from Sig@@ m@@ und Fre@@ ud .
however , Al@@ th@@ us@@ ser does not mean to say that the events that determine social changes all have the same ca@@ usal status .
for Al@@ th@@ us@@ ser , the economic practice of a society determin@@ es which other aspect of that society domin@@ ates the society as a whole .
for Al@@ th@@ us@@ ser , however , a person 's capacity for perce@@ i@@ ving him or her@@ self in this way is not in@@ nate or given .
rather , it is acquired within the structure of established social practices , which impose on individuals the role ( " for@@ me " ) of a subject .
however , other character@@ isti@@ cs of individuals , such as their beli@@ efs about the good life or their met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sical reflec@@ tions on the nature of the self , do not easily fit into these categories .
despite its many institutional forms , the function and structure of ideology is un@@ changing and present throughout history ; as Al@@ th@@ us@@ ser states , " ideology has no history . "
all ide@@ olo@@ gies constitute a subject , even though he or she may differ according to each particular ideology .
the " transformation " of an individual into a subject has always already happened ; Al@@ th@@ us@@ ser here acknowledges a debt to Sp@@ in@@ oza 's theory of im@@ man@@ ence .

if a path@@ og@@ en breaches these barriers , the in@@ nate im@@ mun@@ e system provides an immediate , but non @@@ -@@ @ specific response .
In@@ nate im@@ mun@@ e systems are found in all plants and animals .
here , the im@@ mun@@ e system adap@@ ts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the path@@ og@@ en .
chemical barriers also protect against infection .
growth factors and cy@@ to@@ to@@ xic factors may also be released .
comple@@ ment is the major hum@@ oral component of the in@@ nate im@@ mun@@ e response .
many species have comple@@ ment systems , including non @@@ -@@ @ mam@@ m@@ als like plants , fish , and some in@@ ver@@ te@@ bra@@ tes .

natural kil@@ ler ( N@@ K cells ) cells are le@@ uk@@ oc@@ y@@ tes that attack and destroy t@@ um@@ or cells , or cells that have been infected by vir@@ uses .
should a path@@ og@@ en inf@@ ect the body more than once , these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it .
= = = L@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes = = = The cells of the adap@@ tive im@@ mun@@ e system are special types of le@@ uk@@ oc@@ y@@ tes , called l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
B cells and T cells are the major types of l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and are der@@ ived from hem@@ at@@ op@@ o@@ i@@ etic stem cells in the bone mar@@ row .
B cells are involved in the hum@@ oral im@@ mun@@ e response , whereas T cells are involved in cell @@@ -@@ @ mediated im@@ mun@@ e response .
both B cells and T cells carry rec@@ ep@@ tor mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les that recogn@@ ize specific targets .
there are two major sub@@ types of T cells : the kil@@ ler T cell and the hel@@ per T cell .
kil@@ ler T cells only recogn@@ ize anti@@ gen@@ s coup@@ led to C@@ lass I M@@ H@@ C mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les , while hel@@ per T cells only recogn@@ ize anti@@ gen@@ s coup@@ led to C@@ lass II M@@ H@@ C mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les .
these two mechanisms of anti@@ gen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell .
a third , minor sub@@ type are the γ@@ δ T cells that recogn@@ ize in@@ tact anti@@ gen@@ s that are not bound to M@@ H@@ C rec@@ ep@@ tors .
in contrast , the B cell anti@@ gen @@@ -@@ @ specific rec@@ ep@@ tor is an anti@@ body mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e on the B cell sur@@ face , and recogn@@ iz@@ es whole path@@ o@@ gen@@ s without any need for anti@@ gen processing .
= = = = Kil@@ ler T cells = = = = Kil@@ ler T cells are a sub @@@ -@@ @ group of T cells that kill cells that are infected with vir@@ uses ( and other path@@ o@@ gen@@ s ) , or are otherwise damaged or dys@@ functional .
as with B cells , each type of T cell recogn@@ iz@@ es a different anti@@ gen .
recognition of this M@@ H@@ C : anti@@ gen complex is ai@@ ded by a co @@@ -@@ @ rec@@ ep@@ tor on the T cell , called C@@ D@@ 8 .
the T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the M@@ H@@ C I rec@@ ep@@ tors bear this anti@@ gen .
when an activ@@ ated T cell contacts such cells , it rele@@ ases cy@@ to@@ to@@ x@@ ins , such as perfor@@ in , which form po@@ res in the target cell 's plas@@ ma mem@@ bran@@ e , allowing ions , water and to@@ x@@ ins to enter .
T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the rep@@ lic@@ ation of vir@@ uses .
T cell activ@@ ation is tigh@@ tly controlled and generally requires a very strong M@@ H@@ C / anti@@ gen activ@@ ation signal , or additional activ@@ ation signals provided by " hel@@ per " T cells ( see below ) .
= = = = Hel@@ per T cells = = = = Hel@@ per T cells regulate both the in@@ nate and adap@@ tive im@@ mun@@ e responses and help determine which im@@ mun@@ e responses the body makes to a particular path@@ og@@ en .
they instead control the im@@ mun@@ e response by direc@@ ting other cells to perform these tasks .
Hel@@ per T cells express T cell rec@@ ep@@ tors ( T@@ CR ) that recogn@@ ize anti@@ gen bound to C@@ lass II M@@ H@@ C mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les .
the M@@ H@@ C : anti@@ gen complex is also recogn@@ ized by the hel@@ per cell 's C@@ D@@ 4 co @@@ -@@ @ rec@@ ep@@ tor , which recru@@ its mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les inside the T cell ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . , L@@ ck ) that are responsible for the T cell 's activ@@ ation .
Cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine signals produced by hel@@ per T cells enhance the micro@@ bi@@ cid@@ al function of mac@@ rop@@ ha@@ ges and the activity of kil@@ ler T cells .
for example , large numbers of human V@@ γ@@ 9 / V@@ δ@@ 2 T cells respond within hours to common mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les produced by mic@@ rob@@ es , and highly restricted V@@ δ@@ 1 + T cells in ep@@ ith@@ el@@ ia respond to stressed ep@@ ith@@ el@@ ial cells .
= = = = B l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and anti@@ bodies = = = = A B cell identi@@ fies path@@ o@@ gen@@ s when anti@@ bodies on its sur@@ face bin@@ d to a specific foreign anti@@ gen .
this anti@@ gen / anti@@ body complex is taken up by the B cell and proc@@ essed by prote@@ ol@@ y@@ sis into pe@@ p@@ ti@@ des .
the B cell then dis@@ plays these anti@@ gen@@ ic pe@@ p@@ ti@@ des on its sur@@ face M@@ H@@ C class II mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les .
this combination of M@@ H@@ C and anti@@ gen attr@@ acts a mat@@ ching hel@@ per T cell , which rele@@ ases l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines and activ@@ ates the B cell .
= = = Im@@ mun@@ ological memory = = = When B cells and T cells are activ@@ ated and begin to rep@@ licate , some of their off@@ spring become long @@@ -@@ @ lived memory cells .
throughout the lif@@ etime of an animal , these memory cells remember each specific path@@ og@@ en en@@ countered and can mount a strong response if the path@@ og@@ en is detec@@ ted again .
several lay@@ ers of pas@@ sive protection are provided by the mother .
this is pas@@ sive immunity because the f@@ et@@ us does not actually make any memory cells or anti@@ bodies - it only borro@@ ws them .
this pas@@ sive immunity is usually short @@@ -@@ @ term , lasting from a few days up to several months .
in medicine , protec@@ tive pas@@ sive immunity can also be transferred arti@@ fic@@ ially from one individual to another via anti@@ body @@@ -@@ @ rich ser@@ um .
= = = = Ac@@ tive memory and im@@ mun@@ ization = = = = L@@ ong @@@ -@@ @ term " active " memory is acquired following infection by activ@@ ation of B and T cells .

with inf@@ ec@@ tious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population , vacc@@ ination represents the most effective manip@@ ulation of the im@@ mun@@ e system man@@ kind has developed .

= = = Hy@@ per@@ sensi@@ tivity = = = Hy@@ per@@ sensi@@ tivity is an im@@ mun@@ e response that damages the body 's own tis@@ sues .
this is also called anti@@ body @@@ -@@ @ dependent ( or cy@@ to@@ to@@ xic ) hy@@ per@@ sensi@@ tivity , and is mediated by Ig@@ G and Ig@@ M anti@@ bodies .
im@@ mun@@ e complex@@ es ( ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ations of anti@@ gen@@ s , comple@@ ment prote@@ ins , and Ig@@ G and Ig@@ M anti@@ bodies ) depos@@ ited in various tis@@ sues trigger T@@ y@@ pe III hy@@ per@@ sensi@@ tivity reactions .
these reactions are mediated by T cells , mon@@ oc@@ y@@ tes , and mac@@ rop@@ ha@@ ges .
unlike animals , plants lack p@@ ha@@ go@@ cy@@ tic cells , but many plant im@@ mun@@ e responses involve system@@ ic chemical signals that are sent through a plant .
system@@ ic acquired resistance ( SA@@ R ) is a type of defen@@ sive response used by plants that ren@@ ders the entire plant res@@ istant to a particular inf@@ ec@@ tious ag@@ ent .
= = t@@ um@@ or im@@ mun@@ ology = = A@@ no@@ ther important role of the im@@ mun@@ e system is to identify and eliminate t@@ um@@ ors .
to the im@@ mun@@ e system , these anti@@ gen@@ s appear foreign , and their presence causes im@@ mun@@ e cells to attack the transformed t@@ um@@ or cells .
a third possible source of t@@ um@@ or anti@@ gen@@ s are prote@@ ins norm@@ ally important for regulating cell growth and survival , that com@@ mon@@ ly mut@@ ate into cancer in@@ ducing mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les called on@@ co@@ gen@@ es .
the main response of the im@@ mun@@ e system to t@@ um@@ ors is to destroy the ab@@ normal cells using kil@@ ler T cells , sometimes with the assistance of hel@@ per T cells .
t@@ um@@ or anti@@ gen@@ s are presented on M@@ H@@ C class I mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les in a similar way to vir@@ al anti@@ gen@@ s .
this allows kil@@ ler T cells to recogn@@ ize the t@@ um@@ or cell as ab@@ normal .
N@@ K cells also kill t@@ um@@ or@@ ous cells in a similar way , especially if the t@@ um@@ or cells have fewer M@@ H@@ C class I mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les on their sur@@ face than normal ; this is a common phenomenon with t@@ um@@ ors .
clearly , some t@@ um@@ ors evade the im@@ mun@@ e system and go on to become can@@ c@@ ers .
t@@ um@@ or cells often have a reduced number of M@@ H@@ C class I mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les on their sur@@ face , thus avoiding detection by kil@@ ler T cells .
some t@@ um@@ or cells also release products that in@@ hibi@@ t the im@@ mun@@ e response ; for example by secre@@ ting the cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine T@@ G@@ F @@@ -@@ @ β , which sup@@ pres@@ ses the activity of mac@@ rop@@ ha@@ ges and l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
in addition , Im@@ mun@@ ological tolerance may develop against t@@ um@@ or anti@@ gen@@ s , so the im@@ mun@@ e system no longer attacks the t@@ um@@ or cells .
Cy@@ to@@ to@@ xic drugs in@@ hibi@@ t the im@@ mun@@ e response by killing dividing cells such as activ@@ ated T cells .
however , the killing is in@@ discrimin@@ ate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected , which causes to@@ xic side effects .
= = predic@@ ting im@@ mun@@ o@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity = = larger drugs ( > 500 D@@ a ) can prov@@ oke a neut@@ ral@@ iz@@ ing im@@ mun@@ e response , particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly , or in larger dos@@ es .
this limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger pe@@ p@@ ti@@ des and prote@@ ins ( which are typically larger than 6@@ 000 D@@ a ) .
in some cases , the drug itself is not im@@ mun@@ o@@ gen@@ ic , but may be co @@@ -@@ @ administered with an im@@ mun@@ o@@ gen@@ ic compo@@ und , as is sometimes the case for Ta@@ x@@ ol .
bac@@ ter@@ ia often overcome physical barriers by secre@@ ting en@@ z@@ y@@ mes that di@@ gest the barrier , for example , by using a type II secre@@ tion system .
other bac@@ ter@@ ia , such as " My@@ co@@ bac@@ ter@@ ium tub@@ er@@ cul@@ osis , " live inside a protec@@ tive cap@@ sul@@ e that preven@@ ts ly@@ sis by comple@@ ment .

increased rates among het@@ er@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ als have occurred in China and Russia since the 1990s .
the symp@@ t@@ oms of sy@@ phil@@ is have become less severe over the 19th and 20th centuries , in part due to widespread avail@@ ability of effective treatment and partly due to decreas@@ ing vir@@ ul@@ ence of the sp@@ i@@ ro@@ cha@@ ete .

the highest point of the bridge is 1@@ 17 m ( 3@@ 84 ft ) above mean sea level ; the clear@@ ance under the main sp@@ an is 6@@ 1.3 m ( 20@@ 1 ft ) at high ti@@ de .
the bridge is an impressive sight , and a good view can be obtained from the Bal@@ bo@@ a y@@ ac@@ ht Club , where many small boats tie up before or after trans@@ iting the can@@ al .
throughout the day and night numerous vessels pass under the bridge , either entering or depar@@ ting from the Pan@@ ama Can@@ al .
this was an issue even during construction , when bar@@ ges were used to fer@@ ry construction workers across the can@@ al .
after the can@@ al opened , the increasing number of cars , and the construction of a new road leading to Chi@@ ri@@ qu@@ í , in the west of Pan@@ ama , increased the need for some kind of crossing .
the Pan@@ ama Can@@ al Mec@@ han@@ ical Di@@ vision addressed this in August 19@@ 31 , with the commission@@ ing of two new fer@@ ries , the " Presiden@@ te A@@ mad@@ or " and " President Washington .

Sal@@ am was a science advis@@ or to the Government of Pakistan from 1960 to 1974 , a position from which he played a major and influential role in Pakistan 's science infrastructure .
Sal@@ am was responsible for not only major developments and contributions in the@@ ore@@ tical and parti@@ cle physi@@ cs , but also for promoting scientific research to maximum levels in his country .
Sal@@ am was the founding director of Space and U@@ p@@ per atmosphere Research Commission ( S@@ U@@ PA@@ RC@@ O ) , and responsible for the establishment of the the@@ ore@@ tical P@@ hy@@ sics Group ( T@@ P@@ G ) in Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission ( PA@@ EC ) .
in 1998 , following the country 's nuclear tests , the Government of Pakistan issued a commemor@@ ative stamp , as a part of " Scienti@@ sts of Pakistan , " to honour the services of Sal@@ am .
Sal@@ am heavily contributed to the rise of Pak@@ ist@@ ani physi@@ cs to the P@@ hy@@ sics community in the world .
Sal@@ am 's father was an education officer in the Department of Education of Pun@@ j@@ a@@ b State in a poor far@@ ming district .
his father wanted him to join Indian Civil Service .
in M@@ ath@@ em@@ atics from the Government College University in 19@@ 46 .
Sal@@ am returned to J@@ han@@ g , Pun@@ j@@ a@@ b ( now part of Pakistan ) and renewed his scholar@@ ship and returned to the United Kingdom to do his doc@@ torate .
his doc@@ toral th@@ es@@ is contained comprehensive and fundamental work in qu@@ ant@@ um elec@@ tro@@ dynam@@ ics .
during his doc@@ toral studies , his ment@@ ors challenged him to solve within one year an in@@ tr@@ ac@@ table problem which had de@@ fied such great min@@ ds as Di@@ rac and F@@ eyn@@ man .
within six months , Sal@@ am had found a solution for the ren@@ or@@ mal@@ isation of mes@@ on theory .
as he proposed the solution at the Cav@@ en@@ dish Lab@@ or@@ atory , Sal@@ am had attracted the attention of Be@@ the , Op@@ pen@@ he@@ i@@ mer and Di@@ rac .
as he became the chairman , Sal@@ am sought to up@@ date the university curricul@@ um , making a course of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics as a part of under@@ graduate course .
this was soon rever@@ ted by the Vice @@@ -@@ @ Chancellor , and Sal@@ am decided to te@@ ach an evening course in qu@@ ant@@ um Mec@@ han@@ ics outside the regular curricul@@ um .
as a result , Ri@@ az@@ u@@ d@@ din remained the only student of Sal@@ am who has the privil@@ ege to study under Sal@@ am at the under @@@ -@@ @ graduate and post @@@ -@@ @ graduate level in L@@ ah@@ ore , and Post @@@ -@@ @ doc@@ toral level in C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge University .
in 19@@ 53 , Sal@@ am was unable to establish a research institute in L@@ ah@@ ore , as he faced strong opposition from his pe@@ ers .
in 19@@ 54 , Sal@@ am took fel@@ low@@ ship and became one of the ear@@ li@@ est fel@@ lows of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences .
in 19@@ 57 , Pun@@ j@@ a@@ b University con@@ ferred Sal@@ am with an Hon@@ orary doc@@ torate for his contribution in parti@@ cle physi@@ cs .
the same year with help from his ment@@ or , Sal@@ am launched a scholar@@ ship programme for his students in Pakistan .
Sal@@ am re@@ tained strong links with Pakistan , and visited his country from time to time .
at C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge and Im@@ per@@ ial College he formed a group of the@@ ore@@ tical physi@@ c@@ ists , the majority of whom were his Pak@@ ist@@ ani students .
Op@@ pen@@ he@@ i@@ mer and Sal@@ am discussed the foundation of elec@@ tro@@ dynam@@ ics , problems and their solution .
his dedicated personal assistant was Jean Bou@@ ck@@ ley .
in 1980 , Sal@@ am became a foreign fellow of the Ban@@ gla@@ des@@ h Academy of Sciences .
= = = Scientific career = = = E@@ arly in his career , Sal@@ am made an important and significant contribution in qu@@ ant@@ um elec@@ tro@@ dynam@@ ics and qu@@ ant@@ um field theory , including its extension into parti@@ cle and nuclear physi@@ cs .
in his early career in Pakistan , Sal@@ am was greatly interested in ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal series and their relation to physi@@ cs .
Sal@@ am had played an influential role in the advan@@ cement of nuclear physi@@ cs , but he maintained and dedicated himself to ma@@ them@@ atics and the@@ ore@@ tical physi@@ cs and focused Pakistan to do more research in the@@ ore@@ tical physi@@ cs .
however , he regarded nuclear physi@@ cs ( nuclear fis@@ sion and nuclear power ) as a non @@@ -@@ @ p@@ ion@@ eering part of physi@@ cs as it had already " happened . "
even in Pakistan , Sal@@ am was the leading driving force in the@@ ore@@ tical physi@@ cs in Pakistan , with many scientists he continued to influence and encourage to keep their work on the@@ ore@@ tical physi@@ cs .
Sal@@ am had a prol@@ if@@ ic research career in the@@ ore@@ tical and high @@@ -@@ @ energy physi@@ cs .
Sal@@ am had worked on theory of the neutr@@ ino - an elu@@ sive parti@@ cle that was first pos@@ tu@@ lated by Wolfgang Pa@@ uli in 19@@ 30@@ s .
Sal@@ am introduced ch@@ iral sym@@ me@@ try in the theory of neutr@@ inos .
Sal@@ am later passed his work to Ri@@ az@@ u@@ d@@ din , who made p@@ ion@@ eering contributions in neutr@@ inos .
Sal@@ am introduced the massive Hig@@ gs bos@@ ons to the theory of the Standard Mo@@ del , where he later predicted the existence of pro@@ ton dec@@ ay .
in 1963 , Sal@@ am published his the@@ ore@@ tical work on the v@@ ec@@ tor mes@@ on .
the paper introduced the inter@@ action of v@@ ec@@ tor mes@@ on , pho@@ ton ( v@@ ec@@ tor elec@@ tro@@ dynam@@ ics ) , and the ren@@ or@@ mal@@ ization of v@@ ec@@ tor mes@@ ons ' known mass after the inter@@ action .
in 19@@ 61 , Sal@@ am began to work with John C@@ live W@@ ard on sym@@ me@@ tries and Elec@@ tro@@ weak unification .
in 19@@ 64 , Sal@@ am and W@@ ard worked on a ga@@ uge theory for the weak and elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic inter@@ action , subsequently obtaining S@@ U ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) model .
Sal@@ am was convinced that all the elementary parti@@ cle inter@@ actions are actually the ga@@ uge inter@@ actions .
in 19@@ 68 , together with We@@ in@@ berg and S@@ hel@@ don G@@ las@@ how , Sal@@ am formu@@ lated the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal concept of their work .
while in Im@@ per@@ ial College , Sal@@ am , along with G@@ las@@ how and Jeffrey Gol@@ d@@ stone , ma@@ them@@ atically proved the Gol@@ d@@ stone 's the@@ o@@ rem , that a mas@@ s@@ less sp@@ in @@@ -@@ @ zero object must appear in a theory as a result of spon@@ tane@@ ous breaking of a continuous global sym@@ me@@ try .
in 1960 , Sal@@ am and We@@ in@@ berg incorpor@@ ated the Hig@@ gs mechanism into G@@ las@@ how 's discovery , giving a it a modern form in elec@@ tro@@ weak theory , and thus the@@ or@@ ised the Standard Mo@@ del .
in 19@@ 68 , together with We@@ in@@ berg and S@@ hel@@ don G@@ las@@ how , Sal@@ am finally formu@@ lated the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal concept of their work .
in 19@@ 66 , Sal@@ am carried out p@@ ion@@ eering work on a hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical parti@@ cle .
Sal@@ am showed the possible elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic inter@@ action between the Mag@@ ne@@ tic mon@@ op@@ ole and the C @@@ -@@ @ violation , thus he formu@@ lated the mag@@ ne@@ tic pho@@ ton .
following the publication of P@@ RL Sy@@ m@@ me@@ try breaking papers in 19@@ 64 , Steven We@@ in@@ berg and Sal@@ am were the first to apply the Hig@@ gs mechanism to elec@@ tro@@ weak sym@@ me@@ try breaking .
Sal@@ am provided a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal pos@@ tu@@ lation for the inter@@ action between the Hig@@ gs bos@@ on and the elec@@ tro@@ weak sym@@ me@@ try theory .
in 197@@ 2 , Sal@@ am began to work with Indian @@@ -@@ @ American the@@ ore@@ tical physi@@ cist Jo@@ ges@@ h Pat@@ i .
Pat@@ i wrote to Sal@@ am several times expressing interest to work under Sal@@ am 's direction , in response to which Sal@@ am eventually invited Pat@@ i to the IC@@ TP seminar in Pakistan .
Sal@@ am suggested to Pat@@ i that there should be some deep reason why the pro@@ t@@ ons and elec@@ tr@@ ons are so different and yet carry equal but opposite electric charge .
Pro@@ t@@ ons carry quar@@ ks , but the elec@@ tro@@ weak theory was concerned only with the elec@@ tr@@ ons and neutr@@ inos , with nothing pos@@ tu@@ lated about quar@@ ks .
if all of nature 's ing@@ redi@@ ents could be brought together in one new sym@@ me@@ try , it might reveal a reason for the various features of these parti@@ c@@ les and the forces they feel .
in 197@@ 3 , Sal@@ am and Jo@@ ges@@ h Pat@@ i were the first to no@@ tice that since Qu@@ ar@@ ks and L@@ ep@@ t@@ ons have very similar S@@ U ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) representation content , they all may have similar entities .
physi@@ c@@ ists had believed that there were four fundamental forces of nature : the gra@@ vit@@ ational force , the strong and weak nuclear forces , and the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force .
Sal@@ am had worked on the unification of these forces from 19@@ 59 with G@@ las@@ how and We@@ in@@ berg .
while at Im@@ per@@ ial College London , Sal@@ am successfully showed that weak nuclear forces are not really different from elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic forces , and two could inter @@@ -@@ @ conver@@ t .
Sal@@ am provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature , weak nuclear forces and the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic forces , one into another .
in the 197@@ 0s Sal@@ am continued trying to un@@ ify forces by including the strong inter@@ action in a grand unified theory .
= = Government work = = Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am immediately returned to Pakistan in 1960 to take charge of a government post that was given to him by President Fi@@ eld Mar@@ sh@@ al Ay@@ u@@ b K@@ han .
even the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission ( PA@@ EC ) headquarters was located in a small room , and less than 10 scientists were working on a fundamental concep@@ ts of physi@@ cs .
Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am expanded the web of physi@@ cs research and development in Pakistan by sending more than 500 scientists abroad .
in September 19@@ 61 , Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am appro@@ ached President Ay@@ u@@ b K@@ han to set up the country 's first national space agency .
on 16 September 19@@ 61 , through an executive order , Space and U@@ p@@ per atmosphere Research Commission was established , in which Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am served as the first director .
before 1960 , very little work on scientific development was done , and scientific activities in Pakistan were almost dimin@@ ished .
Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am called I@@ sh@@ fa@@ q Ah@@ ma@@ d , a nuclear physi@@ cist , who had left the country for Switzerland where he joined CERN , to Pakistan .
in 1967 , Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am became a central and administrative figure to lead the research in both the@@ ore@@ tical and parti@@ cle physi@@ cs .
with the establishment of Institute of P@@ hy@@ sics at Qu@@ aid @@@ -@@ @ e @@@ -@@ @ Az@@ am University , the research in the@@ ore@@ tical and parti@@ cle physi@@ cs was engaged .
another physi@@ cist , Raz@@ i@@ u@@ d@@ din S@@ iddi@@ qu@@ i , established numerous physi@@ cs research group and supervised research activities in the academic institutions of Pakistan .
under the direction of Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am , research in physi@@ cs reached a point that prompted worldwide recognition of Pak@@ ist@@ ani physi@@ c@@ ists .
Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am moved PA@@ EC Headquarters to a bigger building , and established research laborat@@ ories all over the country .
on the direction of Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am , I@@ shr@@ at Hus@@ sa@@ in Us@@ mani set up pl@@ ut@@ on@@ ium and uranium exploration committees throughout the country .
in October 19@@ 61 , Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am travelled to the United States and signed a space @@@ -@@ @ co@@ operation agreement between Pakistan and United States .
on November 19@@ 61 , NASA started to build a space facility - F@@ light T@@ est Ran@@ ge - in B@@ alo@@ ch@@ istan where Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am served as its first technical director .
Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am played an influential and significant role in Pakistan 's development in nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
the same year , Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am joined Mun@@ ir Ah@@ ma@@ d K@@ han - Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am 's lif@@ el@@ ong friend and contemporary at Government College University .
K@@ han was the first person in the IAEA that Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am had consul@@ ted about the establishment of International Centre for the@@ ore@@ tical P@@ hy@@ sics , a research physi@@ cs institution , in Trieste , Italy .
at IAEA , Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am had ti@@ rele@@ ss@@ ly advoc@@ ated the importance of nuclear power plants in his country .
it was due to his effort that in 19@@ 65 , Canada and Pakistan signed a nuclear energy co@@ operation deal .
in 19@@ 65 , with the efforts led by Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am , the United States and Pakistan signed an agreement in which th U@@ .S. provided Pakistan with a small research reac@@ tor .
Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am had a long dream to establish a research institute in Pakistan , for which he had advoc@@ ated on many different occasions .
in 19@@ 65 , Ab@@ du@@ s Sal@@ am and Edward Dur@@ rell St@@ one signed a contract for the establishment of Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology at N@@ il@@ ore , Islam@@ ab@@ ad .
in November 19@@ 61 , NASA built F@@ light T@@ est Center ( F@@ TC ) in B@@ alo@@ ch@@ istan Pro@@ v@@ ince .

en@@ vi@@ ous of the great wealth these em@@ pi@@ res generated , England , France , and the Netherlands began to establish col@@ on@@ ies and trade networks of their own in the Americ@@ as and Asia .
the independence of the thir@@ teen col@@ on@@ ies in North America in 17@@ 83 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most popul@@ ous col@@ on@@ ies .
Cab@@ ot led another vo@@ y@@ age to the Americ@@ as the following year but nothing was heard of his ships again .
at the same time , influential writers such as Richard Hak@@ luy@@ t and John De@@ e ( who was the first to use the term " British Empire " ) were beginning to press for the establishment of England 's own emp@@ ire .
several people who helped establish the plan@@ tations of Ireland also played a part in the early col@@ on@@ isation of North America , particularly a group known as the West Country men .

in 18@@ 39 , Britain moved to pre @@@ -@@ @ em@@ pt this by inv@@ ading Afghanistan , but the First An@@ g@@ lo @@@ -@@ @ Afghan War was a disaster for Britain .
the destruction of the Russian Nav@@ y by the Japanese at the B@@ attle of P@@ ort Ar@@ th@@ ur during the Rus@@ so @@@ -@@ @ Japanese War of 19@@ 04 @@@ -@@ @ 05 also limited its threat to the British .

the British declaration of war on Germany and its allies also committed the col@@ on@@ ies and Domin@@ ions , which provided inv@@ alu@@ able military , financial and material support .
Britain gained control of Palest@@ ine , Trans@@ j@@ or@@ dan , Iraq , parts of Cam@@ ero@@ on and To@@ go , and Tan@@ g@@ any@@ ika .
the Domin@@ ions themselves also acquired mandates of their own : the Union of South Africa gained South @@@ -@@ @ West Africa ( modern @@@ -@@ @ day Nam@@ i@@ bia ) , Australia gained German New Gu@@ ine@@ a , and New Zealand Western Sam@@ o@@ a .
although the issue of the emp@@ ire 's security was a serious concern in Britain , at the same time the emp@@ ire was vital to the British economy .
the Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a gu@@ er@@ ril@@ la war against the British administration .
a similar struggle began in India when the Government of India Ac@@ t 19@@ 19 failed to satisfy demand for independence .
Australia , Canada , New Zealand , New@@ found@@ land and South Africa all soon declared war on Germany , but the Irish Free State chose to remain legally neutral throughout the war .
in December 19@@ 41 , Japan launched , in quick succ@@ ession , attacks on British Mal@@ aya , the United States naval base at P@@ ear@@ l Har@@ bor , and Hong Kong .
the situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War ri@@ val@@ ry of the United States and the Soviet Union .
between 1945 and 19@@ 65 , the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700 million to five million , three million of whom were in Hong Kong .
congress favoured a unified secular Indian state , whereas the League , fearing domin@@ ation by the Hin@@ du majority , desi@@ red a separate Islamic state for Muslim @@@ -@@ @ majority regions .
when the ur@@ gency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent , the newly appointed ( and last ) Vic@@ er@@ oy , Lord Moun@@ t@@ bat@@ ten , has@@ ti@@ ly brought forward the date to 15 August 19@@ 47 .
the borders drawn by the British to broad@@ ly partition India into Hin@@ du and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan .
the British M@@ and@@ ate of Palest@@ ine , where an Arab majority lived alongside a Jewish minority , presented the British with a similar problem to that of India .
the UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palest@@ ine into a Jewish and an Arab state .
the Mal@@ ayan Emer@@ gency , as it was called , began in 19@@ 48 and lasted until 1960 , but by 19@@ 57 , Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the Federation of Mal@@ aya within the Com@@ mon@@ wealth .

here , an en@@ z@@ y@@ me such as DNA pol@@ y@@ mer@@ ase cataly@@ zes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step .

these tigh@@ tly bound ions or mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les are usually found in the active site and are involved in cataly@@ sis .
in the presence of an en@@ z@@ y@@ me , the reaction runs in the same direction as it would without the en@@ z@@ y@@ me , just more quickly .
for example , the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of ATP is often used to drive other chemical reactions .
the major contribution of Micha@@ el@@ is and Men@@ ten was to think of en@@ z@@ y@@ me reactions in two stages .
this is sometimes called the Micha@@ el@@ is @@@ -@@ @ Men@@ ten complex in their hon@@ or .
the en@@ z@@ y@@ me then cataly@@ zes the chemical step in the reaction and rele@@ ases the product .
this is shown in the sat@@ ur@@ ation cur@@ ve on the right .
at the maximum reaction rate ( " V " Ma@@ x ) of the en@@ z@@ y@@ me , all the en@@ z@@ y@@ me active sites are bound to sub@@ str@@ ate , and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of en@@ z@@ y@@ me .
" V " Ma@@ x is only one of several important kin@@ etic parame@@ ters .
the amount of sub@@ str@@ ate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important .
this is a form of negative fe@@ ed@@ back .
other AT@@ Pas@@ es in the cell mem@@ bran@@ e are Ion pum@@ ps involved in active transport .
en@@ z@@ y@@ mes are also involved in more ex@@ otic functions , such as lu@@ ci@@ fer@@ ase gener@@ ating light in fi@@ ref@@ lies .
an important function of en@@ z@@ y@@ mes is in the di@@ ges@@ tive systems of animals .
in a Met@@ abol@@ ic path@@ way , one en@@ z@@ y@@ me takes the product of another en@@ z@@ y@@ me as a sub@@ str@@ ate .
negative fe@@ ed@@ back mechanism can effectively ad@@ just the rate of syn@@ th@@ es@@ is of inter@@ mediate met@@ abol@@ ites according to the demands of the cells .
one example of en@@ z@@ y@@ me defic@@ i@@ ency is the most common type of ph@@ en@@ yl@@ ket@@ onur@@ ia .

Gram@@ s@@ ci was in Tur@@ in as it was going through industri@@ al@@ ization , with the Fiat and Lan@@ cia factories recru@@ iting workers from poo@@ rer regions .
Gram@@ s@@ ci joined the Italian Socialist Party in late 19@@ 13 .
at university , he had come into contact with the thought of Antonio L@@ abri@@ ola , Rod@@ ol@@ f@@ o Mon@@ dol@@ f@@ o , Gi@@ ov@@ anni Gen@@ tile and , most importantly , Ben@@ ede@@ tto Cro@@ ce , possibly the most widely respected Italian intellectual of his day .
though Gram@@ s@@ ci would later use this ph@@ r@@ ase to escape the prison cen@@ sors , his relationship with this current of thought was ambi@@ gu@@ ous throughout his life .
an artic@@ ulate and prol@@ if@@ ic writer of political theory , Gram@@ s@@ ci proved a formidable commentator , writing on all aspects of Tur@@ in 's social and political life .
in April 19@@ 19 with T@@ og@@ li@@ at@@ ti , Angel@@ o Tas@@ ca and Um@@ berto Ter@@ rac@@ ini Gram@@ s@@ ci set up the weekly newspaper " L '@@ Ord@@ ine Nu@@ ovo " ( The New Order ) .
the " L '@@ Ord@@ ine Nu@@ ovo " group was seen by Vladimir L@@ enin as closest in ori@@ entation to the Bol@@ sh@@ ev@@ ik@@ s , and it received his backing against the anti @@@ -@@ @ parliamentary programme of the extreme left A@@ ma@@ de@@ o Bor@@ di@@ ga .
= = = In the Communist Party of Italy = = = The failure of the workers ' coun@@ cils to develop into a national movement led Gram@@ s@@ ci to believe that a Communist Party in the Len@@ inist sense was needed .
in 19@@ 22 Gram@@ s@@ ci travelled to Russia as a representative of the new party .
at its L@@ yon Congress in January 19@@ 26 , Gram@@ s@@ ci 's th@@ es@@ es calling for a united front to restore democracy to Italy were adopted by the party .
T@@ og@@ li@@ at@@ ti , in Moscow as a representative of the party , received the letter , opened it , read it , and decided not to deliver it .
this caused a difficult conflict between Gram@@ s@@ ci and T@@ og@@ li@@ at@@ ti which they never completely resolved .
he received an immediate sentence of 5 years in con@@ fin@@ ement on the island of U@@ sti@@ ca and the following year he received a sentence of 20 years of prison in Tur@@ i , near B@@ ari .
in 19@@ 34 he gained conditional freedom on health grounds , after visiting hospitals in Ci@@ vit@@ av@@ ec@@ chi@@ a , For@@ m@@ ia and Rome .
= = Th@@ ought = = Gram@@ s@@ ci was one of the most important Mar@@ x@@ ist thin@@ kers of the tw@@ enti@@ eth century , and a particularly key thin@@ ker in the development of Western Mar@@ x@@ ism .
he wrote more than 30 no@@ te@@ books and 3@@ 000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment .
Gram@@ s@@ ci stated that bour@@ geo@@ is cultural values were tied to folklore , popular culture and religion , and therefore much of his analysis of he@@ gem@@ onic culture is aimed at these .
for Gram@@ s@@ ci , Mar@@ x@@ ism could super@@ se@@ de religion only if it met people 's spir@@ itual needs , and to do so people would have to think of it as an expression of their own experience .
= = = intellectuals and education = = = Gram@@ s@@ ci gave much thought to the role of intellectuals in society .
fam@@ ously , he stated that all men are intellectuals , in that all have intellectual and r@@ ational fac@@ ul@@ ties , but not all men have the social function of intellectuals .
such " organ@@ ic " intellectuals do not simply describe social life in accordance with scientific rules , but instead artic@@ ulate , through the language of culture , the feel@@ ings and experiences which the mas@@ ses could not express for themselves .
for this reason , parti@@ s@@ ans of ad@@ ult and popular education consider Gram@@ s@@ ci an important voice to this day .
he stresses , however , that the division is pu@@ rely concep@@ tual and that the two , in reality , often over@@ la@@ p .
Gram@@ s@@ ci pro@@ ffers that under modern capitalism , the bour@@ geo@@ is@@ ie can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by trade unions and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sp@@ here .
Gram@@ s@@ ci pos@@ its that movements such as refor@@ mism and fas@@ c@@ ism , as well as the ' scientific management ' and assembly line methods of Fre@@ der@@ ick Tay@@ lor and Henry Ford respectively , are examples of this .
in Gram@@ s@@ ci 's view , all meaning der@@ ives from the relation between human practical activity ( or " pra@@ x@@ is " ) and the " objective " historical and social processes of which it is a part .
this anti @@@ -@@ @ scienti@@ stic and anti @@@ -@@ @ positi@@ vis@@ t stance was indebted to the influence of Ben@@ ede@@ tto Cro@@ ce .
for Gram@@ s@@ ci , Mar@@ x@@ ism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself , independent of humanity .
natural history was thus only mean@@ ing@@ ful in relation to human history .

with most of its five million soldiers demo@@ bil@@ ized , the Red Army was transformed into a small regular force , and territorial mil@@ iti@@ as were created for wartime mobil@@ ization .
Soviet military schools , established during the civil war , began to graduate large numbers of trained officers loyal to the Soviet power .
L@@ enin provided an early experim@@ ent of Mar@@ x 's theory when he inv@@ aded Poland in hopes of gener@@ ating a communist uprising in neigh@@ bor@@ ing Germany .
in 19@@ 21 , a Red Army occupation of the Democratic Republic of Georgia over@@ threw the representative Georgian government and replaced it with a Soviet Republic .
in 19@@ 37 , however , Stal@@ in p@@ urged the Red Army of its best military leaders .
in 197@@ 3 the minister of defen@@ se became a full pol@@ it@@ bur@@ o member for the first time since 19@@ 57 .
yet Brez@@ h@@ ne@@ v ev@@ id@@ ently felt threatened by the professional military , and he sought to create an a@@ ura of military leadership around himself in an effort to establish his authority over the armed forces .
this decision was influenced by the form@@ ative wars of its history , name@@ ly the Russian Civil War and the Polish @@@ -@@ @ Soviet War .
instead , they featured long range mobile operations , often by small but highly motivated forces , as well as rapid advances of hundreds of kilo@@ meters in a matter of days .
the huge tank forces , powerful only on paper , were mostly anni@@ hil@@ ated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Bar@@ bar@@ os@@ sa .
nevertheless , the revol@@ utionary doc@@ tr@@ ines of the 19@@ 30@@ s , modi@@ fied by combat experience , were eventually successfully used at the front starting in 19@@ 43 after the Red Army reg@@ ained the initiative .
Nazi @@@ -@@ @ Soviet relations were temper@@ ed by H@@ itler 's personal hatred of the people of East Europe and by the longstanding ide@@ ological fe@@ ud between fas@@ c@@ ism and communism .
as a direct result of the Soviet aggres@@ sion the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of N@@ ations on December 14 , 19@@ 39 .
the Red Army en@@ circ@@ led and destroyed significant German forces at the B@@ attle of Stal@@ in@@ grad , which ended in February 19@@ 43 and rever@@ sed the ti@@ de of the war in Europe .
in the summer of 19@@ 43 , following the B@@ attle of Kur@@ sk , the Red Army seized the strategic initiative for the remain@@ der of the war .
once Germany had surrendered , the Red Army joined the war against Japan , and in summer 1945 carried out an offensive against Japanese forces stationed in northern Man@@ chur@@ ia .
the Red Army emerged from the war as one of the most powerful land armies in history with five million soldiers , and more tanks and ar@@ til@@ lery than all other countries combined .
during the war , the Red Army was perceived as being far more powerful than any other country .
many of the Soviet forces who fought to liber@@ ate the countries of Eastern Europe from Nazi control remained in the region even after Germany 's surrender in 1945 .
the Sov@@ i@@ ets quickly became an enormous political and economic influence in the region and the Soviet Union actively assisted local communist parties in coming to power .
by 19@@ 48 , seven eastern European countries had communist governments .
extensive arms sales made weapons like the AK @@@ -@@ @ 47 and the T @@@ -@@ @ 55 tank ic@@ ons of the contemporary wars between Israel and its Arab neigh@@ b@@ ors .
after ten years of fighting at the cost of approximately 20 billion dollars a year ( in 1986 United States dollars ) and 15,000 Soviet casualties , Gor@@ bac@@ hev surrendered to public opinion and ordered troops to withdraw in early 1989 .
from the late 19@@ 4@@ 0s , the Soviet armed forces focused on adap@@ ting to the Cold War in the era of nuclear arms by achieving par@@ ity with the United States in strategic nuclear weapons .
though the Soviet Union had proposed various nuclear dis@@ ar@@ mam@@ ent plans after the U@@ .S. development of at@@ om@@ ic weapons in the Second World War , the Cold War saw the Sov@@ i@@ ets in the process of developing and deplo@@ ying nuclear weapons in full force .
by the late 19@@ 6@@ 0s , the Soviet Union had reached a roug@@ h par@@ ity with the United States in some categories of strategic weap@@ on@@ ry , and at that time offered to negotiate limits on strategic nuclear weapons deplo@@ y@@ ments .
as part of the salt process , the AB@@ M Treaty was also signed .
a second salt agreement , salt II , was signed in June 1979 in Vienna .
at one time , the Soviet Union maintained the world 's largest nuclear ar@@ sen@@ al in history .
according to estimates by the Natural Res@@ ources Def@@ en@@ se Council , the peak of approximately 4@@ 5,000 war@@ heads was reached in 1986 .
roughly 20,000 of these were believed to be tac@@ tical nuclear weapons , reflecting the Red Army doc@@ tr@@ ine that fav@@ ored the use of these weapons if war came in Europe .
these weapons were considered both offensive and defen@@ sive in nature .
as a result , the Soviet Union has produced some of the world 's most advanced ar@@ mam@@ ents .
the integration of the party , government , and military in the Soviet Union was most evident in the area of defen@@ se @@@ -@@ @ related industrial production .
Gos@@ plan , the state planning committee , had an important role in direc@@ ting necessary supplies and resources to military industries .
the Def@@ en@@ se Council made decisions on the development and production of major weapons systems .
at the time , the military @@@ -@@ @ industrial complex employed at least one of every five adults in the Soviet Union .
in 1985 , the Soviet military had about 5.@@ 3 million men ; by 1990 the number declined to about four million .
at the time the Soviet Union dis@@ solved , the resi@@ dual forces belonging to the Russian Federation were 2.7 million strong .
on April 9 , 1989 , the army , together with M@@ V@@ D units , killed 20 demonstrators in T@@ bil@@ isi in Georgia .
the last v@@ esti@@ ges of the old Soviet command structure were finally dis@@ solved in June 1993 .
most of the nuclear sto@@ ck@@ p@@ ile was inherited by Russia .
in many cases , involvement was in the form of military advis@@ ors as well as the sale or provision of weapons .

C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us was born and died in Royal Pr@@ us@@ sia , a region that had been a part of the Kingdom of Poland since 14@@ 66 .
Nicola@@ us was the youngest of four children .
the village 's name has been var@@ iously sp@@ elled K@@ oper@@ nik , C@@ oper@@ nik , C@@ oper@@ nic , K@@ oper@@ nic , Cop@@ ri@@ r@@ nik , and today K@@ oper@@ ni@@ ki .
in the 14th century , members of the family began moving to various other Sil@@ es@@ ian cities , to the Polish capital , K@@ rak@@ ó@@ w ( 13@@ 67 ) , and to Tor@@ u@@ ń ( 1@@ 400 ) .
Nicola@@ us ' father was actively engaged in the politics of the day and supported Poland and the cities against the Te@@ ut@@ onic Order .
C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us ' father married Bar@@ bar@@ a Wat@@ zen@@ ro@@ de , the as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer 's mother , between 14@@ 61 and 14@@ 64 .
the Wat@@ zen@@ ro@@ de family , like the K@@ oper@@ nik family , had come from Sil@@ es@@ ia from near Ś@@ w@@ id@@ nica ( Sch@@ we@@ id@@ nit@@ z ) , and after 13@@ 60 had settled in Tor@@ u@@ ń .
they soon became one of the wealth@@ iest and most influential patri@@ cian families .
the M@@ od@@ li@@ b@@ ó@@ gs ( the Polish name means " pra@@ y God " ) were a prominent Polish family who had been well known in Poland 's history since 12@@ 71 .

Luc@@ as Wat@@ zen@@ ro@@ de the younger , the as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer 's mater@@ nal un@@ cle and pat@@ ron , was educated at the University of K@@ rak@@ ó@@ w ( now Jag@@ i@@ el@@ lon@@ ian University ) and at the universities of C@@ ologn@@ e and Bologna .
he was a friend and key advis@@ or to each ru@@ ler , and his influence greatly strengthened the ties between War@@ m@@ ia and Poland proper .
he also spoke Polish , Greek and Italian .
the vast majority of C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us ' survi@@ ving works are in Latin , which in his lif@@ etime was the language of academ@@ ia in Europe .
the German philosophy professor Martin Car@@ ri@@ er men@@ tions this as a reason to consider C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us ' native language to have been German .
as was to be the case with William S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are a century later , numerous sp@@ elling vari@@ ants of the name are documented for the as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer and his relatives .
the name first appeared as a place name in Sil@@ es@@ ia in the 13th century , where it was sp@@ elled var@@ iously in Latin documents .
during his ch@@ ild@@ hood , about 14@@ 80 , the name of his father ( and thus of the future as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer ) was recorded in Th@@ or@@ n as " Nic@@ las Kop@@ per@@ n@@ ig@@ k . "

these acceler@@ ators are used for experim@@ ental parti@@ cle physi@@ cs .
for the most basic inqu@@ iri@@ es into the dynam@@ ics and structure of matter , space , and time , physi@@ c@@ ists seek the simp@@ lest kinds of inter@@ actions at the highest possible ener@@ gies .

S@@ L@@ A@@ C is an elec@@ tr@@ on @@@ -@@ @ Pos@@ it@@ ron Col@@ lider .
as they pass through a hol@@ e in the pla@@ te , the polar@@ ity is swit@@ ched so that the pla@@ te now rep@@ els them and they are now accelerated by it towards the next pla@@ te .
as the parti@@ c@@ les approach the speed of light the swit@@ ching rate of the electric fields becomes so high that they operate at radio frequ@@ encies , and so micro@@ wave c@@ av@@ ities are used in higher energy machines instead of simple plates .
lin@@ e@@ ar acceler@@ ators are also widely used in medicine , for radi@@ other@@ ap@@ y and radi@@ os@@ ur@@ gery .
another advantage is that a cir@@ cular acceler@@ ator is smaller than a lin@@ e@@ ar acceler@@ ator of compar@@ able power ( i@@ .@@ e@@ .
certain acceler@@ ators ( syn@@ ch@@ ro@@ tr@@ ons ) are however built spec@@ ially for producing syn@@ ch@@ ro@@ tr@@ on light ( X @@@ -@@ @ r@@ ays ) .
therefore parti@@ cle physi@@ c@@ ists do not generally think in terms of speed , but rather in terms of a parti@@ cle 's energy or momentum , usually meas@@ ured in elec@@ tr@@ on vol@@ ts ( e@@ V ) .

if accelerated further , the be@@ am would continue to spir@@ al ou@@ tw@@ ard to a larger radi@@ us but the parti@@ c@@ les would no longer gain enough speed to complete the larger circ@@ le in step with the acceler@@ ating R@@ F .

the energy and current correspon@@ d to 1.3 MW be@@ am power which is the highest of any acceler@@ ator currently existing .
this approach suffers from low average be@@ am inten@@ s@@ ity due to the bun@@ ching , and again from the need for a huge mag@@ net of large radi@@ us and constant field over the larger or@@ bit demanded by high energy .
higher energy parti@@ c@@ les travel a shorter distance in each or@@ bit than they would in a classical cy@@ clo@@ tr@@ on , thus remaining in phase with the acceler@@ ating field .
the main dis@@ advantages are the size and cost of the large mag@@ net needed , and the difficulty in achieving the high mag@@ ne@@ tic field values required at the ou@@ ter edge of the structure .

philosophy in the Soviet Union was officially con@@ fined to Mar@@ x@@ ist @@@ -@@ @ Len@@ inist thinking , which the@@ ore@@ tically was the basis of objective and ultimate phil@@ osoph@@ ical truth .
from the beginning of Bol@@ sh@@ ev@@ ik regime , the aim of official Soviet philosophy ( which was ta@@ ught as an oblig@@ atory subject for every course ) , was the the@@ ore@@ tical justi@@ fication of Communist ideas .
L@@ enin hence took position between a histor@@ ic@@ ist Mar@@ x@@ ism ( L@@ abri@@ ola ) and a determin@@ ist Mar@@ x@@ ism , close to what was later called " social Dar@@ win@@ ism " ( K@@ aut@@ sky ) .
the mechan@@ ists ( A@@ .@@ K@@ .

taking support on the theory of rela@@ tivity and qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics , they responded that the mechan@@ ists ' concep@@ tion of nature was too restricted and narrow .

= = E@@ arly life and education = = Pas@@ cal was born in C@@ ler@@ mont @@@ -@@ @ Fer@@ r@@ and ; he lost his mother , An@@ to@@ in@@ ette Beg@@ on , at the age of three .
his father , É@@ ti@@ en@@ ne Pas@@ cal ( 15@@ 88 @@@ -@@ @ 16@@ 51 ) , who also had an interest in science and ma@@ them@@ atics , was a local judge and member of the " N@@ ob@@ les@@ se de Ro@@ be . "
Pas@@ cal had two s@@ ist@@ ers , the younger Jacqu@@ eline and the el@@ der G@@ il@@ ber@@ te .
in 16@@ 31 , five years after the death of his wife , É@@ ti@@ en@@ ne Pas@@ cal moved with his children to Paris .
the newly arrived family soon hired Lou@@ ise Del@@ fault , a ma@@ id who eventually became an instr@@ um@@ ental member of the family .
É@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , who never remar@@ ried , decided that he alone would educ@@ ate his children , for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability , particularly his son Bla@@ ise .
the young Pas@@ cal showed an amaz@@ ing ap@@ titu@@ de for ma@@ them@@ atics and science .
particularly of interest to Pas@@ cal was a work of Des@@ argues on con@@ ic sections .
it states that if a h@@ ex@@ agon is ins@@ cri@@ bed in a circ@@ le ( or con@@ ic ) then the three inter@@ section points of opposite sides lie on a line ( called the Pas@@ cal line ) .
in 16@@ 31 É@@ ti@@ en@@ ne sold his position as second president of the " C@@ our des A@@ ides " for 6@@ 5,@@ 6@@ 65 li@@ v@@ res .
but in 16@@ 38 Ric@@ hel@@ i@@ e@@ u , desper@@ ate for money to carry on the Thir@@ ty Ye@@ ars ' War , de@@ fa@@ ulted on the government 's bonds .
su@@ d@@ den@@ ly É@@ ti@@ en@@ ne Pas@@ cal 's worth had dropped from nearly 6@@ 6,000 li@@ v@@ res to less than 7,@@ 300 .
it was only when Jacqu@@ eline performed well in a children 's play with Ric@@ hel@@ i@@ e@@ u in attendance that É@@ ti@@ en@@ ne was par@@ don@@ ed .
of the eight Pas@@ cal@@ ines known to have survived , four are held by the Mus@@ é@@ e des Arts et M@@ é@@ ti@@ ers in Paris and one more by the Z@@ w@@ inger museum in D@@ res@@ den , Germany , exhibit two of his original mechan@@ ical calc@@ ula@@ tors .
Pas@@ cal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade and he ref@@ ers to some 50 machines that were built to his design .
Pas@@ cal later ( in the " Pen@@ s@@ é@@ es " ) used a prob@@ abil@@ istic argument , Pas@@ cal 's W@@ ager , to justify belief in God and a vir@@ tu@@ ous life .
the work done by Fer@@ mat and Pas@@ cal into the cal@@ cul@@ us of prob@@ abilities laid important ground@@ work for Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z ' formu@@ lation of the cal@@ cul@@ us .
after a religious experience in 16@@ 54 , Pas@@ cal mostly gave up work in ma@@ them@@ atics .
the work was un@@ published until over a century after his death .
Pas@@ cal also used " De l '@@ E@@ sp@@ ri@@ t g@@ é@@ om@@ é@@ tri@@ que " to develop a theory of defin@@ ition .
he distinguished between defin@@ itions which are conventional la@@ bel@@ s defined by the writer and defin@@ itions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they n@@ atur@@ ally designate their refer@@ ent .
Pas@@ cal claimed that only defin@@ itions of the first type were important to science and ma@@ them@@ atics , arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of form@@ alism as formu@@ lated by Des@@ car@@ tes .
Pas@@ cal agreed with Mon@@ ta@@ ig@@ ne that achieving certain@@ ty in these ax@@ i@@ oms and conclusions through human methods is impossible .
he demonstrated this principle by att@@ aching a th@@ in Tube to a bar@@ rel full of water and filling the Tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building .
by 16@@ 46 , Pas@@ cal had learned of Evangel@@ ist@@ a Tor@@ ri@@ cel@@ li 's experim@@ entation with baro@@ meters .
at the time , most scientists conten@@ ded that , rather than a vac@@ u@@ um , some in@@ visible matter was present .
this was based on the Ar@@ ist@@ ote@@ li@@ an no@@ tion that creation was a thing of sub@@ stance , whether visible or in@@ visible ; and that this sub@@ stance was fore@@ ver in motion .
therefore , to the Ar@@ ist@@ ote@@ li@@ an trained scientists of Pas@@ cal 's time , a vac@@ u@@ um was an im@@ possibility .
how so ?
* Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le wrote how everything moved , and must be moved by something .
his father died in 16@@ 51 and left his inher@@ it@@ ance to Pas@@ cal and Jacqu@@ eline , for whom Pas@@ cal acted as her con@@ ser@@ vat@@ or .
Jacqu@@ eline announced that she would soon become a post@@ ul@@ ant in the J@@ ans@@ en@@ ist conv@@ ent of P@@ ort @@@ -@@ @ Royal .
Pas@@ cal was deeply affected and very sad , not because of her choice , but because of his chron@@ ic poor health ; he too needed her .
" su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there was war in the Pas@@ cal household .
Bla@@ ise pleaded with Jacqu@@ eline not to leave , but she was adam@@ ant .
in early January , Jacqu@@ eline left for P@@ ort @@@ -@@ @ Royal .
during visits to his sister at P@@ ort @@@ -@@ @ Royal in 16@@ 54 , he displayed con@@ temp@@ t for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God .
God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , God of I@@ sa@@ ac , God of Jac@@ o@@ b , not of the phil@@ osoph@@ ers and the scholars ... " and concluded by quoting P@@ sal@@ m 1@@ 19 : 16 : " I will not forget TH@@ Y word .
this piece is now known as the " Memorial . "
for the next four years , he regularly travelled between P@@ ort @@@ -@@ @ Royal and Paris .
it was at this point immediately after his con@@ version when he began writing his first major literary work on religion , the " Pro@@ vin@@ cial Let@@ ters . "
= = = The " Pro@@ vin@@ cial Let@@ ters " = = = Beg@@ in@@ ning in 16@@ 56 , Pas@@ cal published his memor@@ able attack on casu@@ istry , a popular ethical method used by Catholic thin@@ kers in the early modern period ( especially the J@@ es@@ u@@ its , and in particular Antonio E@@ sco@@ bar ) .
the 18 @@@ -@@ @ letter series was published between 16@@ 56 and 16@@ 57 under the p@@ se@@ u@@ don@@ y@@ m Louis de Mon@@ tal@@ te and incen@@ sed Louis X@@ I@@ V .
even Pope Alexander , while publicly opposing them , non@@ e@@ theless was persu@@ aded by Pas@@ cal 's arguments .
aside from their religious influence , the " Pro@@ vin@@ cial Let@@ ters " were popular as a literary work .
when commenting on one particular section ( Th@@ ought # 72 ) , Sain@@ te @@@ -@@ @ Be@@ u@@ ve praised it as the fin@@ est pages in the French language .
= = = L@@ ast works and death = = = T@@ . S. Eli@@ ot described him during this phase of his life as " a man of the world among as@@ ce@@ tics , and an as@@ ce@@ tic among men of the world .

" Louis X@@ I@@ V sup@@ pressed the J@@ ans@@ en@@ ist movement at P@@ ort @@@ -@@ @ Royal in 16@@ 61 .
later that year , his sister Jacqu@@ eline died , which convinced Pas@@ cal to ce@@ ase his po@@ lem@@ ics on J@@ ans@@ en@@ ism .
Pas@@ cal 's last major achievement , returning to his mechan@@ ical gen@@ i@@ us , was inaugur@@ ating perhaps the first bus line , moving passengers within Paris in a carri@@ age with many seats .
in 16@@ 62 , Pas@@ cal 's ill@@ ness became more violent , and his emo@@ tional condition had severely worsen@@ ed since his sister 's death .
originally applied to g@@ amb@@ ling , today it is extremely important in economics , especially in ac@@ tu@@ ar@@ ial science .
Christi@@ a@@ an H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s , learning of the subject from the correspon@@ dence of Pas@@ cal and Fer@@ mat , wrote the first book on the subject .
later figures who continued the development of the theory include Ab@@ ra@@ ham de Mo@@ iv@@ re and Pierre @@@ -@@ @ Simon Lap@@ la@@ ce .
in literature , Pas@@ cal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Clas@@ sical Per@@ i@@ od and is read today as one of the greatest mas@@ ters of French pro@@ se .
the content of his literary work is best remember@@ ed for its strong opposition to the ration@@ alism of Ren@@ é Des@@ car@@ tes and simultane@@ ous as@@ ser@@ tion that the main counter@@ v@@ ailing philosophy , emp@@ iri@@ c@@ ism , was also insufficient for determining major tru@@ ths .
in France , prestigious annual awards , Bla@@ ise Pas@@ cal chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the I@@ le de France region .
Pas@@ cal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 BBC T@@ wo documentary , " Sea of Fa@@ ith , " presented by D@@ on C@@ up@@ it@@ t .

this differ@@ ed from other Palestinian political and gu@@ er@@ ril@@ la organiz@@ ations , most of which firmly believed in a united Arab response .
A@@ raf@@ at continued this process in other Arab countries such as Libya and Syria .
Fat@@ ah had approximately three hundred members by this time , but none were fighters .
the war ended in an Arab defeat and Israel 's occupation of several Arab territories , including the West Bank and Gaza S@@ trip .

on the night of 21 March , the I@@ D@@ F attacked Kar@@ ame@@ h with heavy weap@@ on@@ ry , ar@@ mo@@ red vehicles and figh@@ ter j@@ ets .
amid the post @@@ -@@ @ war environment , the pro@@ files of A@@ raf@@ at and Fat@@ ah were raised by this important turning point , and he came to be regarded as a national her@@ o who dar@@ ed to conf@@ ront Israel .
he became Commander @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ Chief of the Palestinian Revol@@ utionary Forces two years later , and in 197@@ 3 , became the head of the P@@ L@@ O 's political department .
after their proclaimed victory in the B@@ attle of Kar@@ ame@@ h , Fat@@ ah and other Palestinian mil@@ iti@@ as began taking control of civil life in Jordan .
A@@ raf@@ at refused , citing his belief in the need for a Palestinian state with Palestinian leadership .
as the conflict ra@@ ged , other Arab governments attempted to negotiate a peaceful resolution .
as part of this effort , G@@ am@@ al Ab@@ del N@@ ass@@ er led the first emergency Arab League summit in C@@ air@@ o on 21 September .
by 25 September , the Jord@@ anian army achieved domin@@ ance , and two days later A@@ raf@@ at and Hus@@ sein agreed to a ceasefire in Am@@ man .
A@@ raf@@ at and a number of his forces , including two high @@@ -@@ @ ranking commanders , A@@ bu I@@ y@@ ad and A@@ bu Ji@@ had , were forced into the northern cor@@ ner of Jordan .

A@@ raf@@ at and A@@ bu Ji@@ had blamed themselves for not successfully organiz@@ ing a rescue effort .
one of the most severe - known as the Co@@ ast@@ al Road massacre - occurred on 11 March 197@@ 8 .
in response , the I@@ D@@ F launched Operation Lit@@ ani three days later , with the goal of taking control of Sou@@ thern Lebanon up to the Lit@@ ani River .
on 16 April 1988 , as the In@@ ti@@ fa@@ da was ra@@ ging , A@@ bu Ji@@ had was assassinated in his Tun@@ is household , allegedly by an Israeli hit squad .
A@@ raf@@ at considered A@@ bu Ji@@ had a P@@ L@@ O counter@@ weight to local Palestinian leadership , and led a funeral proc@@ ession for him in Dam@@ as@@ cus .
he made this decision without the consent of other leading members of Fat@@ ah and the P@@ L@@ O .
many in the US also used A@@ raf@@ at 's position as a reason to dis@@ regard his claims to being a partner for peace .
authority over the various fields of rule , including education and culture , social welfare , direct taxation and tourism , would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government .
the following year , A@@ raf@@ at and R@@ ab@@ in were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , along with Sh@@ im@@ on Peres .
it was rejected also by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon , Syria , and Jordan as well as by many Palestinian intellectuals and the local leadership of the Palestinian territories .
however , the inhabitants of the territories generally accepted the agreements and A@@ raf@@ at 's promise for peace and economic well @@@ -@@ @ being .
A@@ raf@@ at also took the liber@@ ty to replace and as@@ sign mayors and city coun@@ cils for major cities such as Gaza and Nab@@ lus .

she is voiced by Jul@@ ie Kav@@ ner and first appeared on television in " The T@@ rac@@ ey Ul@@ l@@ man Show " short " Go@@ od Night " on April 19 , 1987 .
Mar@@ ge was created and designed by car@@ to@@ on@@ ist Mat@@ t Gro@@ ening while he was waiting in the lob@@ by of James L@@ . Bro@@ oks ' office .
he named the character after his mother Margar@@ et Gro@@ ening .
after appe@@ aring on " The T@@ rac@@ ey Ul@@ l@@ man Show " for three se@@ as@@ ons , the S@@ imp@@ son family received their own series on Fo@@ x , which de@@ bu@@ ted December 17 , 1989 .
Mar@@ ge is the well @@@ -@@ @ meaning and extremely patient mat@@ ri@@ arch of the S@@ imp@@ son family .
with her husband Ho@@ mer , she has three children : Bar@@ t , Lis@@ a , and Mag@@ gi@@ e .
Kav@@ ner has won several awards for voicing Mar@@ ge , including a pri@@ me@@ time Em@@ my Award for O@@ ut@@ standing Voice @@@ -@@ @ Over Per@@ for@@ man@@ ce in 1992 .
in 2000 , Mar@@ ge , along with the rest of her family , was awarded a star on the Hollywood Wal@@ k of F@@ ame .
Mar@@ ge S@@ imp@@ son is the wife of Ho@@ mer and mother of Bar@@ t , Lis@@ a and Mag@@ gi@@ e S@@ imp@@ son .
she was raised by her parents , Jacqu@@ eline and C@@ lan@@ cy Bou@@ vi@@ er .
she has a pair of s@@ ist@@ ers , the jo@@ y@@ less Pat@@ ty and Sel@@ ma , both of whom vo@@ cally dis@@ approve of Ho@@ mer .
in " The Way We W@@ as " ( season two , 1991 ) , it is revealed via fl@@ ash@@ back that Mar@@ ge attended Spr@@ ing@@ field High School , and in her final year met Ho@@ mer S@@ imp@@ son .
after the two had been dating for several years , Mar@@ ge discovered she was pregn@@ ant with Bar@@ t , and she and Ho@@ mer were married in a small w@@ edding chap@@ el across the state line .
Bar@@ t was born soon after , and the couple bought their first house .
in season one ( 1990 ) ep@@ iso@@ des " Life on the fast L@@ ane " and " Some en@@ chan@@ ted Even@@ ing , " Mar@@ ge was said to be 34 .
in " Re@@ gar@@ ding Mar@@ gi@@ e " ( season 17 , 2006 ) , Ho@@ mer mentioned that Mar@@ ge was his age , meaning she could have been anywhere between 36 and 40 .
in " The Spr@@ ing@@ field Con@@ nec@@ tion " ( season six , 1995 ) , Mar@@ ge decided that she needed more ex@@ ci@@ tement in her life and became a police officer .

Kav@@ ner had been part of the regular cast of " The T@@ rac@@ ey Ul@@ l@@ man Show . "
" while Mar@@ ge is her most famous character , Kav@@ ner 's favor@@ ite charac@@ ters to voice are Pat@@ ty and Sel@@ ma because " they 're really fun@@ ny and sad at the same time .
Mar@@ ge often provides a gro@@ unding opinion for Ho@@ mer and their marriage has often been shak@@ y .
the next day , Ho@@ mer is dir@@ ty and dis@@ hev@@ eled , and beg@@ s Mar@@ ge to take him back , saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is " complete and ut@@ ter dependence .
in " Mar@@ ge Be Not Pro@@ ud " ( season seven , 1995 ) , she felt she was mo@@ ther@@ ing Bar@@ t too much and started acting more distant towards him after he was caught shop@@ lifting .
she once said " I know Bar@@ t can be a hand@@ ful , but I also know what he 's like inside .
it 's not a bad thing ... O@@ f course , it makes him " do " bad things .
" Mar@@ ge has a good relationship with Lis@@ a and the two are shown to get along quite well .
Mar@@ ge over @@@ -@@ @ mothers Mag@@ gi@@ e , which causes her to become too cl@@ ing@@ y and dependent on Mar@@ ge .
in " M@@ id@@ night T@@ ow@@ boy " ( season 19 , 2007 ) , Mar@@ ge hi@@ res an expert to help make Mag@@ gi@@ e more independent .
however , Mag@@ gi@@ e becomes so independent that she rarely needs Mar@@ ge .
Mar@@ ge begins to mis@@ s Mag@@ gi@@ e , but at the end of the ep@@ iso@@ de , Mag@@ gi@@ e starts to need her again .
Mar@@ ge maintains a good relationship with her mother Jacqu@@ eline and her s@@ ist@@ ers Pat@@ ty and Sel@@ ma , though they dis@@ approve of Ho@@ mer and are vo@@ cal about it .
" Mar@@ ge 's father C@@ lan@@ cy is rarely referred to in the series and has had speaking parts in only two ep@@ iso@@ des .
it was revealed in " Fe@@ ar of F@@ lying " ( season six , 1994 ) that C@@ lan@@ cy told Mar@@ ge that he was a pilot , but in reality , he was a flight atten@@ d@@ ant .
in " Ho@@ mer the Her@@ etic " ( season four , 1992 ) , Ho@@ mer starts sk@@ ip@@ ping church and Mar@@ ge tells him " don '@@ t make me choose between my man and my God , because you just can '@@ t win .. "
in " Lis@@ a the skep@@ tic " ( season nine , 1997 ) , an " an@@ gel skeleton " is discovered , much to the skep@@ ticism of Lis@@ a .
as Lis@@ a rants about the people who believe it is an an@@ gel , Mar@@ ge in@@ forms her that she also believes it is an an@@ gel .
she tells Lis@@ a , " There has to be more life than just what we see , everyone needs something to believe in .
politically , Mar@@ ge generally al@@ ig@@ ns with the Democratic Party , having supported the candidacy of her state 's pro@@ gressive governor Mary B@@ ail@@ ey , and voting for J@@ im@@ my Car@@ ter in both of his presidential elections .
in 2004 , Kav@@ ner and Dan Cas@@ tel@@ lan@@ eta ( the voice of Ho@@ mer ) won a Young Ar@@ tist Award for " Most Pop@@ ular mo@@ m & dad in a TV Ser@@ ies . "
Mar@@ ge has been ranked highly in lists of the top television mothers of all time .
religious writer Ken@@ net@@ h Brig@@ gs has written that " Mar@@ ge is my candidate for sa@@ in@@ tho@@ od [ ... ] S@@ he lives in the real world , she lives with crises , with fla@@ wed people .

Bar@@ th@@ olome@@ w Jo@@ J@@ o " Bar@@ t " S@@ imp@@ son is a fic@@ tional character in the anim@@ ated television series " The S@@ imp@@ sons " and part of the S@@ imp@@ son family .
car@@ to@@ on@@ ist Mat@@ t Gro@@ ening created and designed Bar@@ t while waiting in the lob@@ by of James L@@ . Bro@@ oks ' office .
Gro@@ ening had been called to pit@@ ch a series of shor@@ ts based on " Life in Hel@@ l " but instead decided to create a new set of charac@@ ters .
after appe@@ aring on " The T@@ rac@@ ey Ul@@ l@@ man Show " for three years , the S@@ imp@@ son family received its own series on Fo@@ x , which de@@ bu@@ ted December 17 , 1989 .
at ten years old , Bar@@ t is the el@@ dest child and only son of Ho@@ mer and Mar@@ ge , and the brother of Lis@@ a and Mag@@ gi@@ e .
in casting , N@@ ancy C@@ art@@ wright originally planned to audi@@ tion for the role of Lis@@ a , while Y@@ ear@@ d@@ ley S@@ mit@@ h tried out for B@@ art@@ .
S@@ mit@@ h 's voice was too high for a boy , so she was given the role of Lis@@ a .
C@@ art@@ wright found that Lis@@ a was not interesting at the time , so instead audi@@ tioned for Bar@@ t , which she thought was a better role .
around the third season , the series started to focus more on the family as a whole , though Bar@@ t still remains a prominent character .
in 2000 , Bar@@ t , along with the rest of his family , was awarded a star on the Hollywood Wal@@ k of F@@ ame .
Bar@@ t 's year of birth was stated in " I married Mar@@ ge " ( season three , 1991 ) as being in the early 1980s .
he lived with his parents in the L@@ ow@@ er East of Spr@@ ing@@ field until the S@@ imp@@ sons bought their first house .
Bar@@ t 's first day of school was in the early 1990s .
now , what do you say ?
for the dur@@ ation of the series , Bar@@ t has attended Spr@@ ing@@ field Ele@@ mentary School and has been in Ed@@ na Kra@@ b@@ app@@ el 's fourth grade class .
Bar@@ t was conce@@ ived as an extreme version of the typical mis@@ be@@ having child character , mer@@ ging all of the extreme tra@@ its of charac@@ ters such as Tom S@@ aw@@ yer and H@@ uc@@ k@@ le@@ ber@@ ry Fin@@ n into one person .
Gro@@ ening has also said that he found the pre@@ mis@@ e of " Den@@ nis the men@@ ace " dis@@ appointing and was inspired to create a character who was actually a men@@ ace .
Bar@@ t made his debut with the rest of the S@@ imp@@ son family on April 19 , 1987 in " The T@@ rac@@ ey Ul@@ l@@ man Show " short " Go@@ od Night . "
Bar@@ t and the S@@ imp@@ son family remained the main charac@@ ters on this new show .
the number was later limited to nine sp@@ ik@@ es , all of the same size .
the basic rec@@ tan@@ gular shape of Bar@@ t 's head is described by director Mark Kir@@ k@@ land as a coffee can .
Ho@@ mer 's head is also rec@@ tan@@ gular ( with a d@@ ome on top ) , while sp@@ her@@ es are used for Mar@@ ge , Lis@@ a , and Mag@@ gi@@ e .
former director Jeffrey Lyn@@ ch starts off with a box , then adds the eyes , then the m@@ outh , then the ha@@ ir sp@@ ik@@ es , e@@ ar , and then the rest of the body .
Mat@@ t Gro@@ ening norm@@ ally starts with the eyes , then the n@@ ose , and the rest of the out@@ line of Bar@@ t 's head .
the computer anim@@ ation directors was provided by Pac@@ if@@ ic D@@ ata Images .
they real@@ ized that there were vin@@ y@@ l Bar@@ t dol@@ ls in production and purchased one to use as a model .
= = = Voice = = = Bar@@ t 's voice is provided by N@@ ancy C@@ art@@ wright , who voices several other child charac@@ ters on " The S@@ imp@@ sons , " including Nel@@ son Mun@@ tz , R@@ alp@@ h W@@ ig@@ gu@@ m , T@@ od@@ d F@@ lan@@ ders , and K@@ ear@@ ney .
Y@@ ear@@ d@@ ley S@@ mit@@ h had initially been asked to audi@@ tion for the role of Bar@@ t , but casting director Bon@@ ita Pi@@ eti@@ la believed her voice was too high .
I read two lines as Bar@@ t and they said , ' Than@@ ks for coming !
' " S@@ mit@@ h was given the role of Lis@@ a instead .
on March 13 , 1987 , N@@ ancy C@@ art@@ wright went in to audi@@ tion for the role of Lis@@ a .
C@@ art@@ wright 's normal speaking voice is said to have " no obvious tr@@ aces of B@@ art@@ . "
but Bar@@ t is easy to do .
in fl@@ ash@@ forward ep@@ iso@@ des , C@@ art@@ wright still provides the voice of B@@ art@@ .
for " Lis@@ a 's W@@ edding , " ( season six , 1995 ) Bar@@ t 's voice was electron@@ ically lowered .
despite Bar@@ t 's f@@ ame , C@@ art@@ wright is rarely recogn@@ ized in public .
during the first season of " The S@@ imp@@ sons , " the Fo@@ x Network did not allow C@@ art@@ wright to give interviews because they did not want to pub@@ li@@ ci@@ ze that Bar@@ t was voiced by a woman .
for example , the ch@@ alk@@ board ga@@ g for " Ho@@ mer the Her@@ etic " ( season four , 1992 ) read , " I will not def@@ ame New Or@@ le@@ ans .
one of Bar@@ t 's early hal@@ l@@ marks were his p@@ rank calls to Mo@@ e 's T@@ aver@@ n owner Mo@@ e Sz@@ y@@ s@@ lak in which Bar@@ t calls Mo@@ e and asks for a ga@@ g name .
" Bar@@ t 's other cat@@ ch@@ ph@@ ras@@ es , " ¡ A@@ y , car@@ amba !
despite this , the film was rated P@@ G @@@ -@@ @ 13 by the Mo@@ tion Pic@@ ture Association of America for " Ir@@ rever@@ ent hum@@ or throughout .
" the scene was later included by " Enter@@ tain@@ ment We@@ ek@@ ly " in their list of " 30 un@@ for@@ get@@ table Nu@@ de S@@ cen@@ es .
in his book " Plan@@ et S@@ imp@@ son , " Chris Tur@@ ner describes Bar@@ t as a ni@@ hil@@ ist , a phil@@ osoph@@ ical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning , purpose , or in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic value .
he is constantly at odds with his teacher M@@ s@@ . Kra@@ b@@ app@@ el , Pr@@ in@@ cip@@ al S@@ kin@@ ner , and occasi@@ onally Gro@@ und@@ ske@@ ep@@ er Wil@@ lie .
think I 'm happy about it ?
in " separate V@@ oc@@ ations " ( season three , 1992 ) Bar@@ t becomes hall monitor and his grades go up , suggesting that he struggles mainly because he does not pay attention , not because he is st@@ up@@ id .
this idea is rein@@ forced in " Bro@@ ther 's Lit@@ tle Hel@@ per , " ( season eleven , 1999 ) in which it is revealed that Bar@@ t suffers from attention Def@@ ic@@ it dis@@ order .
due to Bar@@ t 's mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous@@ ness and Ho@@ mer 's often un@@ car@@ ing and in@@ competent behavi@@ or , the two have a turbul@@ ent relationship .
in " Mar@@ ge Be Not Pro@@ ud , " ( season seven , 1995 ) she felt she was mo@@ ther@@ ing Bar@@ t too much and began acting more distant towards him after he was caught shop@@ lifting .
it 's not a bad thing ... O@@ f course , it makes him " do " bad things .
" Bar@@ t shares a si@@ b@@ ling ri@@ val@@ ry with his younger sister , Lis@@ a , but has a bud@@ dy @@@ -@@ @ like relationship with his youngest sister Mag@@ gi@@ e , due to her inf@@ ant state .
he also believes Lis@@ a to be his super@@ ior when it comes to solving problems and frequently goes to her for advice .
out of all of them his best friend is Mil@@ house Van H@@ ou@@ ten , although Bar@@ t has at times shown embar@@ r@@ assment about their friendship .
Bar@@ t is a bad influence on Mil@@ house , and the two have been involved in a lot of mis@@ chief together .
because of this behavi@@ or , Mil@@ house 's mother for@@ bids Mil@@ house from playing with Bar@@ t in " Ho@@ mer defined " ( season three , 1991 ) .
while at first he pre@@ ten@@ ded that he did not care , Bar@@ t eventually real@@ iz@@ es that he needs Mil@@ house , and Mar@@ ge man@@ ages to convince Mr@@ s@@ . Van H@@ ou@@ ten to reconsider .
Bar@@ t is one of the biggest fans of children 's television host Kru@@ st@@ y the C@@ lo@@ wn .
one summer , Bar@@ t enthusias@@ tically attended Kam@@ p Kru@@ st@@ y , which turned out to be a disaster , with Kru@@ st@@ y no@@ where to be seen .
Kru@@ st@@ y immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and man@@ ages to appe@@ ase B@@ art@@ .
one of the original ideas for the series was that Bar@@ t wor@@ shi@@ ped a television clo@@ wn but had no respect for his father , although this was never directly explo@@ red .
because of this original plan , Kru@@ st@@ y 's design is bas@@ ically Ho@@ mer in clo@@ wn make @@@ -@@ @ up .
they took the idea of the Co@@ yo@@ te ch@@ asing the Road runner and depic@@ ted Bo@@ b as an intel@@ lig@@ ent person ob@@ s@@ essed with cat@@ ching a br@@ at@@ ty boy .
in the early 1990s , millions of T @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ir@@ ts featuring Bar@@ t were sold ; as many as one million were sold on some days .
believ@@ ing Bar@@ t to be a bad role model , several American public schools banned T @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ir@@ ts featuring Bar@@ t next to cap@@ tions such as " I 'm Bar@@ t S@@ imp@@ son .
through the summer , several news outlets published stories about the supposed " Bill v@@ s@@ . Bar@@ t " ri@@ val@@ ry .
the August 31 , 1990 issue of " Enter@@ tain@@ ment We@@ ek@@ ly " featured a picture of Bill Cos@@ by wearing a Bar@@ t S@@ imp@@ son T @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ir@@ t .
at the time , it was the most watched ep@@ iso@@ de in the history of the Fo@@ x Network , and it is still the highest rated ep@@ iso@@ de in the history of " The S@@ imp@@ sons . "
because of his popularity , Bar@@ t was often the most promoted member of the S@@ imp@@ son family in adverti@@ sem@@ ents for the show , even for ep@@ iso@@ des in which he was not involved in the main plot .
" in the United States con@@ gres@@ sional , sen@@ at@@ orial and g@@ ub@@ ern@@ at@@ orial elections of 1990 , Bar@@ t was one of the most popular write @@@ -@@ @ in candidates , and in many areas was second only to Mic@@ key mo@@ use am@@ on@@ g@@ st fic@@ tional charac@@ ters .
the Bar@@ t S@@ imp@@ son bal@@ lo@@ on has appeared at every parade since .
" meanwhile , behind and un@@ bek@@ now@@ n@@ st to him , the television brief@@ ly shows a Bar@@ t S@@ imp@@ son bal@@ lo@@ on .
the first single from the album was the pop rap song " D@@ o the B@@ art@@ man , " performed by N@@ ancy C@@ art@@ wright and released on November 20 , 1990 .
Jackson was a fan of " The S@@ imp@@ sons , " especially Bar@@ t , and had called the producers one night offering to write Bar@@ t a number one single and do a guest spot on the show .
Jackson eventually guest star@@ red in the ep@@ iso@@ de " Star@@ k R@@ aving dad " ( season three , 1991 ) under the p@@ se@@ u@@ don@@ y@@ m John J@@ ay S@@ mit@@ h .
while the song was never officially released as a single in the United States , it was successful in the United Kingdom .
in 1991 it was the number one song in the UK for three weeks from February 16 to March 9 and was the seventh best @@@ -@@ @ selling song of the year .
it sold half a million cop@@ ies and was certi@@ fied gold by the British P@@ hon@@ o@@ graphic Industry on February 1 , 1991 .
why should television be full of them ?
as long as we perpet@@ u@@ ate the idea of television as a place where you get all your role models , we 're allowing television to become a school system .
" in response , Mat@@ t Gro@@ ening said , " That sum@@ s up Bar@@ t , all right .
most people are in a struggle to be normal he thinks normal is very bor@@ ing , and does things that others just w@@ ished they dare do .
" on January 27 , 1992 , then @@@ -@@ @ President George H@@ . W. Bush said , " We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family , to make American families a lot more like the W@@ alt@@ ons and a lot less like the S@@ imp@@ sons .

most scholars believe Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z developed cal@@ cul@@ us independently of I@@ sa@@ ac New@@ ton , and Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's no@@ tation has been widely used ever since it was published .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z , along with Ren@@ é Des@@ car@@ tes and Bar@@ u@@ ch Sp@@ in@@ oza , was one of the three great 17th century advocates of ration@@ alism .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z made major contributions to physi@@ cs and technology , and anticipated no@@ tions that sur@@ faced much later in philosophy , prob@@ ability theory , bi@@ ology , medicine , ge@@ ology , psych@@ ology , lin@@ gu@@ isti@@ cs , and computer science .
he wrote works on philosophy , politics , law , eth@@ ics , the@@ ology , history , and phil@@ ology .
he wrote in several languages , but primarily in Latin , French , and German .
there is no complete gathering of the writ@@ ings of Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z .
" his father died when he was six years old , and from that point on he was raised by his mother .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's father had been a Professor of moral Phil@@ osophy at the University of Le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g , and the boy later inherited his father 's personal library .
he was given free access to it from the age of seven .
he enrol@@ led in his father 's former university at age 15 , and completed his bac@@ hel@@ or 's degree in Phil@@ osophy in December 16@@ 62 .
he published and defended a dis@@ ser@@ tation " speci@@ men Qu@@ a@@ esti@@ on@@ um Phil@@ os@@ op@@ hic@@ ar@@ um ex J@@ ure collec@@ tar@@ um , " arguing for both a the@@ ore@@ tical and a P@@ ed@@ ag@@ og@@ ical relationship between philosophy and law , in December 16@@ 64 .
after one year of legal studies , he was awarded his bac@@ hel@@ or 's degree in Law on September 28 , 16@@ 65 .
in 16@@ 66 , at age 20 , Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z wrote his first book , " On the Art of combin@@ ations , " the first part of which was also his habil@@ itation th@@ es@@ is in Phil@@ osophy .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z subsequently left Le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z then enrol@@ led in the University of Alt@@ dor@@ f and quickly submitted a th@@ es@@ is , which he had probably been working on earlier in Le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z earned his license to practice law and his Do@@ c@@ torate in Law in November 16@@ 66 .
he next declined the offer of an academic appointment at Alt@@ dor@@ f , saying that " my th@@ ou@@ ghts were turned in an entirely different direction . "
von Boy@@ ne@@ burg hired Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z as an assistant , and shortly there@@ after reconc@@ iled with the Elec@@ tor and introduced Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z to him .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z then dedicated an es@@ say on law to the Elec@@ tor in the hope of obtaining employment .
although von Boy@@ ne@@ burg died late in 16@@ 72 , Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z remained under the employment of his wi@@ dow until she dismissed him in 16@@ 74 .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's service to the Elec@@ tor soon followed a diplomatic role .
he published an es@@ say , under the p@@ se@@ u@@ don@@ y@@ m of a fic@@ ti@@ tious Polish no@@ ble@@ man , arguing ( un@@ successfully ) for the German candidate for the Polish cro@@ wn .
soon after arriving , he met Dutch physi@@ cist and ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian Christi@@ a@@ an H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s and realised that his own knowledge of ma@@ them@@ atics and physi@@ cs was pat@@ ch@@ y .
he be@@ fri@@ ended a German ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian , E@@ h@@ ren@@ fri@@ ed Wal@@ ther von T@@ sch@@ ir@@ n@@ ha@@ us ; they correspon@@ ded for the rest of their lives .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z declined the invitation , but began correspon@@ ding with the Duk@@ e in 16@@ 71 .
on the journey from London to Han@@ over , Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z stopped in The Hague where he met Le@@ eu@@ w@@ en@@ ho@@ ek , the discover@@ er of micro@@ organis@@ ms .
the population of Han@@ over was only about 10,000 , and its prov@@ inci@@ ality eventually gra@@ ted on Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z .
by 16@@ 77 he had a co@@ her@@ ent system in hand , but did not publish it until 16@@ 84 .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's most important ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal papers were published between 16@@ 82 and 16@@ 92 , usually in a journ@@ al which he and O@@ tto Men@@ c@@ ke founded in 16@@ 82 , the " ACTA E@@ ru@@ di@@ tor@@ um . "
from 16@@ 87 to 16@@ 90 , Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z trav@@ eled exten@@ sively in Germany , Austria , and Italy , seeking and finding archi@@ val materials bearing on this project .
in 17@@ 11 , while traveling in northern Europe , the Russian T@@ sar Peter the Great stopped in Han@@ over and met Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z , who then took some interest in Russian matters for the rest of his life .
finally , his de@@ ar friend and def@@ ender , the Dow@@ ager Elec@@ tress Sop@@ hi@@ a , died in 17@@ 14 .
even though Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z was a life member of the Royal Society and the Berlin Academy of Sciences , neither organiz@@ ation saw fit to hon@@ or his passing .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z was e@@ ul@@ o@@ giz@@ ed by Fon@@ ten@@ elle , before the Acade@@ m@@ ie des Sciences in Paris , which had admitted him as a foreign member in 17@@ 00 .
he had many friends and ad@@ mir@@ ers all over Europe .
he wrote only two book @@@ -@@ @ length phil@@ osoph@@ ical tre@@ atis@@ es , of which only the " Th@@ é@@ o@@ dic@@ é@@ e " of 17@@ 10 was published in his lif@@ etime .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z dated his beginning as a phil@@ os@@ opher to his " dis@@ course on Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sics , " which he composed in 16@@ 86 as a commen@@ tary on a running dispute between Nicolas Mal@@ e@@ bran@@ che and An@@ to@@ ine Ar@@ na@@ uld .
the " Mon@@ ad@@ olo@@ gi@@ e , " composed in 17@@ 14 and published pos@@ thum@@ ously , consists of 90 ap@@ hor@@ isms .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z met Sp@@ in@@ oza in 16@@ 76 , read some of his un@@ published writ@@ ings , and has since been suspected of appropri@@ ating some of Sp@@ in@@ oza 's ideas .
= = = The Pr@@ in@@ cip@@ les = = = Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z var@@ iously inv@@ oked one or another of seven fundamental phil@@ osoph@@ ical Pr@@ in@@ cip@@ les : * I@@ denti@@ ty / con@@ tradi@@ ction .
if a pro@@ position is true , then its neg@@ ation is false and vice ver@@ sa .
Mon@@ ads are cen@@ ters of force ; sub@@ stance is force , while space , matter , and motion are mer@@ ely phenom@@ en@@ al .
in effect , apparent f@@ laws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world , because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those f@@ laws .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z then appro@@ ached one of the central critic@@ isms of Christian the@@ ism : if God is all good , all wise and all powerful , how did ev@@ il come into the world ?
the answer ( according to Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z ) is that , while God is indeed un@@ limited in wis@@ dom and power , his human cre@@ ations , as cre@@ ations , are limited both in their wis@@ dom and in their will ( power to act ) .
but Gerhard and C@@ ou@@ tur@@ at did not publish these writ@@ ings until modern formal lo@@ gic had emerged in Fre@@ ge 's " Beg@@ ri@@ ff@@ s@@ sch@@ rift " and in writ@@ ings by Charles Sand@@ ers Pe@@ ir@@ ce and his students in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , and hence well after Bo@@ ole and De M@@ organ began that lo@@ gic in 18@@ 47 .
but Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z took his spec@@ ulations much further .
many charac@@ ters well known in his day , including Egyptian hi@@ er@@ og@@ ly@@ ph@@ ics , Chinese charac@@ ters , and the symbols of astr@@ onomy and chem@@ istry , he deemed not real .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z saw that the uni@@ qu@@ eness of prime fac@@ tor@@ ization suggests a central role for prime numbers in the universal character@@ istic , a striking anticip@@ ation of Gö@@ del num@@ ber@@ ing .
granted , there is no in@@ tu@@ itive or mn@@ em@@ onic way to number any set of elementary concep@@ ts using the prime numbers .
the resulting " character@@ istic " included a logical cal@@ cul@@ us , some combin@@ ator@@ ics , Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , his " analysis sit@@ us " ( geo@@ me@@ try of situation ) , a universal concept language , and more .
what Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z actually intended by his " character@@ isti@@ ca uni@@ ver@@ sal@@ is " and cal@@ cul@@ us rati@@ o@@ cin@@ ator , and the extent to which modern formal lo@@ gic does justice to the cal@@ cul@@ us , may never be established .
the best over@@ view of Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's writ@@ ings on the cal@@ cul@@ us may be found in B@@ os ( 1974 ) .
= = = Cal@@ cul@@ us = = = Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z is credi@@ ted , along with S@@ ir I@@ sa@@ ac New@@ ton , with the discovery of cal@@ cul@@ us ( differ@@ ential and integral cal@@ cul@@ us ) .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z did not publish anything about his cal@@ cul@@ us until 16@@ 84 .
in addition , the the@@ o@@ rem that tells how and when to differ@@ enti@@ ate under the integral sign is called the Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z integral rule .
from 17@@ 11 until his death , Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z was engaged in a dispute with John Ke@@ ill , New@@ ton and others , over whether Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z had in@@ ven@@ ted the cal@@ cul@@ us independently of New@@ ton .
the use of in@@ fin@@ ite@@ sim@@ als in ma@@ them@@ atics was fro@@ w@@ ned upon by followers of Kar@@ l We@@ i@@ er@@ str@@ ass , but survived in science and engineering , and even in rigor@@ ous ma@@ them@@ atics , via the fundamental comp@@ ut@@ ational device known as the differ@@ ential .
there are two takes on this situation .
but H@@ ide@@ aki H@@ ir@@ ano argues differ@@ ently , quoting Man@@ del@@ bro@@ t : to samp@@ le Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z ' scientific works is a so@@ ber@@ ing experience .
in " E@@ uc@@ li@@ dis Pro@@ ta ... , " which is an attempt to tigh@@ ten E@@ uc@@ li@@ d 's ax@@ i@@ oms , he states ... : ' I have di@@ verse defin@@ itions for the stra@@ ight line .
thus the frac@@ tal geo@@ me@@ try promoted by Man@@ del@@ bro@@ t drew on Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's no@@ tions of self @@@ -@@ @ simil@@ ar@@ ity and the principle of continuity : " N@@ atur@@ a non s@@ alt@@ um fac@@ it . "
this process can be continued in@@ fin@@ itely , from which ar@@ ises a good idea of self @@@ -@@ @ simil@@ ar@@ ity .

= = = = The " vis Vi@@ va " = = = = Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's " vis Vi@@ va " ( Latin for " living force " ) is " m@@ v " 2 , twice the modern kin@@ etic energy .
he real@@ ized that the total energy would be con@@ served in certain mechan@@ ical systems , so he considered it an in@@ nate motive character@@ istic of matter .
in reality , both energy and momentum are con@@ served , so the two approaches are equally valid .
in em@@ br@@ yolo@@ gy , he was a pre@@ form@@ ation@@ ist , but also proposed that organis@@ ms are the outcome of a combination of an in@@ fin@@ ite number of possible micro@@ structures and of their powers .
his theory regarding con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness in relation to the principle of continuity can be seen as an early theory regarding the stages of sle@@ ep .
he believed that there are many " peti@@ tes perceptions , " or small perceptions of which we perce@@ ive but are unaware of .
additionally , the idea of sub@@ li@@ minal sti@@ mul@@ i can be tr@@ ac@@ ed back to this theory .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's ideas regarding music and t@@ onal perception went on to influence the laboratory studies of Wil@@ helm W@@ und@@ t .
in economic policy , he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program , and discussed the balance of trade .
he even proposed something ak@@ in to what much later emerged as game theory .
in soci@@ ology he laid the ground for communication theory .
= = = Technology = = = In 19@@ 06 , Gar@@ land published a volume of Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's writ@@ ings bearing on his many practical in@@ ven@@ tions and engineering work .
nevertheless , it is well understood that Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z was a serious invent@@ or , engine@@ er , and applied scientist , with great respect for practical life .
he even proposed a method for de@@ sal@@ in@@ ating water .
from 16@@ 80 to 16@@ 85 , he strugg@@ led to overcome the chron@@ ic flooding that aff@@ lic@@ ted the du@@ cal silver mines in the Har@@ z Moun@@ tains , but did not succeed .
early in life , he documented the bin@@ ary num@@ eral system ( base 2 ) , then re@@ visited that system throughout his career .
in 16@@ 71 , Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z began to inv@@ ent a machine that could exec@@ ute all four ar@@ ith@@ me@@ tical operations , gradually improving it over a number of years .
a number of such machines were made during his years in Han@@ over , by a craf@@ t@@ sman working under Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's supervision .
it was not an un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous success because it did not fully mechan@@ ize the operation of carrying .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z also dev@@ ised a ( now re@@ produced ) cip@@ her machine , recovered by Nicholas Res@@ cher in 2010 .
Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z was gro@@ ping towards hard@@ w@@ are and software concep@@ ts worked out much later by Charles Bab@@ bage and A@@ da Lov@@ e@@ la@@ ce .
the latter library was enormous for its day , as it contained more than 100,000 vol@@ u@@ mes , and Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z helped design a new building for it , believed to be the first building exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly designed to be a library .
he also designed a book inde@@ xing system in ignor@@ ance of the only other such system then ex@@ tant , that of the Bod@@ le@@ ian Library at O@@ x@@ ford University .
he called for the creation of an emp@@ iri@@ cal database as a way to further all sci@@ ences .

having read " Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us Sin@@ ic@@ us Phil@@ osoph@@ us " on the first year of its publication , he concluded that Europeans could learn much from the Con@@ fu@@ cian ethical tradition .

X@@ enon is a chemical element with symbol X@@ e and at@@ om@@ ic number 54 .
the iso@@ top@@ e rati@@ os of x@@ enon are an important tool for studying the early history of the So@@ lar System .
the first ex@@ ci@@ mer las@@ er design used a x@@ enon di@@ mer mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e ( X@@ e@@ 2 ) as its las@@ ing medium , and the ear@@ li@@ est las@@ er design@@ s used x@@ enon f@@ lash lam@@ ps as pum@@ ps .

in 19@@ 39 , American physi@@ cian Albert R@@ . Beh@@ n@@ ke J@@ r@@ . began expl@@ oring the causes of " dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness " in deep @@@ -@@ @ sea di@@ vers .
X@@ enon was first used as a sur@@ gical an@@ es@@ thetic in 19@@ 51 by American an@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ologist Stu@@ art C. Cul@@ len , who successfully operated on two patients .
since then , many other x@@ enon compo@@ unds have been discovered , along with some compo@@ unds of the no@@ ble gas@@ es Arg@@ on , kr@@ y@@ p@@ ton , and rad@@ on , including Arg@@ on f@@ lu@@ or@@ o@@ hy@@ dri@@ de ( H@@ Ar@@ F ) , kr@@ y@@ p@@ ton di@@ f@@ lu@@ or@@ ide ( Kr@@ F@@ 2 ) , and rad@@ on f@@ lu@@ or@@ ide .
at standard temper@@ ature and pressure , p@@ ure x@@ enon gas has a den@@ s@@ ity of 5.@@ 7@@ 61 kg / m@@ 3 , about 4.5 times the sur@@ face den@@ s@@ ity of the Earth 's atmosphere , 1.@@ 2@@ 17 kg / m@@ 3 .
as a liqu@@ id , x@@ enon has a den@@ s@@ ity of up to 3.@@ 100 G / m@@ l , with the den@@ s@@ ity maximum oc@@ curr@@ ing at the triple point .
under the same conditions , the den@@ s@@ ity of solid x@@ enon , 3.@@ 6@@ 40 G / c@@ m@@ 3 , is higher than the average den@@ s@@ ity of gran@@ ite , 2.@@ 75 G / c@@ m@@ 3 .
it is in@@ ert to most common chemical reactions ( such as comb@@ us@@ tion , for example ) because the ou@@ ter val@@ ence shel@@ l contains eight elec@@ tr@@ ons .
this produces a stable , minimum energy config@@ ur@@ ation in which the ou@@ ter elec@@ tr@@ ons are tigh@@ tly bound .
this was discovered in the ear@@ li@@ est nuclear reactors built by the American Man@@ hat@@ tan Project for pl@@ ut@@ on@@ ium production .
in a similar way , x@@ enon iso@@ topic rati@@ os such as 12@@ 9@@ X@@ e / 13@@ 0@@ X@@ e and 13@@ 6@@ X@@ e / 13@@ 0@@ X@@ e are also a powerful tool for understanding plan@@ etary differ@@ enti@@ ation and early out@@ g@@ ass@@ ing .

such cla@@ th@@ rate hy@@ dra@@ tes can occur n@@ atur@@ ally under conditions of high pressure , such as in Lake V@@ os@@ to@@ k under@@ ne@@ ath the An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic ice she@@ et .
using this techni@@ que , chemical reactions on the ful@@ ler@@ ene mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e can be analy@@ z@@ ed , due to the sensi@@ tivity of the chemical shift of the x@@ enon atom to its environment .
however , the x@@ enon atom also has an electronic influence on the reac@@ tivity of the ful@@ ler@@ ene .
the typical lif@@ etime of a x@@ enon ex@@ ci@@ mer is 1 @@@ -@@ @ 5 NS , and the dec@@ ay rele@@ ases pho@@ t@@ ons with w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ ths of about 150 and 17@@ 3 N@@ M .
these Ar@@ c lam@@ ps are an excellent source of short w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let radi@@ ation and they have intense emissions in the near inf@@ rar@@ ed , which is used in some night vision systems .
= = = = L@@ as@@ ers = = = = In 19@@ 62 , a group of researchers at Bel@@ l laborat@@ ories discovered las@@ er action in x@@ enon , and later found that the las@@ er gain was improved by adding hel@@ ium to the las@@ ing medium .
the first ex@@ ci@@ mer las@@ er used a x@@ enon di@@ mer ( X@@ e@@ 2 ) ener@@ giz@@ ed by a be@@ am of elec@@ tr@@ ons to produce stimu@@ lated emis@@ sion at an ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of 17@@ 6 N@@ M .
unlike nit@@ ro@@ us ox@@ ide ( N@@ 2@@ O ) , x@@ enon is not a green@@ house gas and so it is also viewed as environment@@ ally friendly .
X@@ enon was first used for satellite Ion eng@@ ines during the 197@@ 0s .
it was later employed as a pro@@ p@@ el@@ lan@@ t for J@@ P@@ L 's De@@ ep Space 1 probe , Europe 's s@@ mar@@ t @@@ -@@ @ 1 sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft and for the three Ion pro@@ pul@@ sion eng@@ ines on NASA 's Da@@ wn Sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft .

X@@ enon is also used in prote@@ in cr@@ y@@ stal@@ lo@@ graphy .
as x@@ enon is expensive , the gas sul@@ f@@ ur h@@ ex@@ af@@ lu@@ or@@ ide , which is similar to x@@ enon in mo@@ lec@@ ular weight ( 14@@ 6 ver@@ sus 1@@ 31 ) , is generally used in this stun@@ t , and is an as@@ phy@@ x@@ i@@ ant without being an@@ es@@ thetic .
space tele@@ sc@@ op@@ es were proposed as early as 19@@ 23 .
H@@ ub@@ ble is the only tele@@ scope designed to be ser@@ vic@@ ed in space by as@@ tron@@ au@@ ts .
second , a space @@@ -@@ @ based tele@@ scope could observe inf@@ rar@@ ed and ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let light , which are strongly absor@@ bed by the atmosphere .
Sp@@ it@@ zer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space tele@@ scope .
O@@ AO @@@ -@@ @ 1 's bat@@ tery failed after three days , termin@@ ating the mission .
it was followed by O@@ AO @@@ -@@ @ 2 , which carried out ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ob@@ serv@@ ations of stars and gal@@ ax@@ ies from its launch in 19@@ 68 until 197@@ 2 , well beyond its original planned lif@@ etime of one year .
in response to this , a nationwide lobbying effort was co@@ ordinated among astronom@@ ers .
the National Academy of Sciences published a report emphas@@ iz@@ ing the need for a space tele@@ scope , and eventually the Senate agreed to half of the budget that had originally been approved by Congress .
congress eventually approved funding of US $ 36 million for 197@@ 8 , and the design of the L@@ S@@ T began in ear@@ n@@ est , aiming for a launch date of 198@@ 3 .

the mir@@ ror and op@@ tical systems of the tele@@ scope determine the final performance , and they were designed to ex@@ acting specif@@ ic@@ ations .
therefore its mir@@ ror needed to be pol@@ ished to an accur@@ acy of 10 nano@@ meters , or about 1 / 65 of the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of red light .
( the team of K@@ odak and I@@ tek also bid on the original mir@@ ror polis@@ hing work .
an I@@ tek mir@@ ror built as part of the effort is now used in the 2.@@ 4 m tele@@ scope at the Mag@@ dal@@ ena Rid@@ ge Ob@@ ser@@ vatory .
doubts continued to be expressed about Per@@ kin @@@ -@@ @ El@@ mer 's compet@@ ence on a project of this importance , as their budget and ti@@ mes@@ cal@@ e for producing the rest of the O@@ TA continued to inf@@ late .
NASA was forced to postpone the launch date until March and then September 1986 .
by this time , the total project budget had risen to US $ 1.@@ 17@@ 5 billion .
= = = Sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft systems = = = The sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft in which the tele@@ scope and instruments were to be ho@@ used was another major engineering challenge .
to reduce that risk , a nit@@ ro@@ gen gas pur@@ ge was performed before launching the tele@@ scope into space .
it was built by the God@@ dar@@ d Space F@@ light Center and could achieve a spec@@ tral resolution of 9@@ 0,000 .
also op@@ tim@@ ized for ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ob@@ serv@@ ations were the FO@@ C and FO@@ S , which were capable of the highest sp@@ ati@@ al resolution of any instruments on H@@ ub@@ ble .
the FO@@ C was constructed by ES@@ A , while the University of California , San Di@@ eg@@ o , and Martin Mari@@ et@@ ta Corporation built the FO@@ S .
the final instrument was the H@@ SP , designed and built at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @@@ -@@ @ Mad@@ ison .

= = Life in Athens = = Accor@@ ding to the disputed statements of the ancient writers and some modern scholars , in Athens A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia became a het@@ a@@ era and probably ran a bro@@ the@@ l .
according to Pl@@ ut@@ arch , A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia was compared to the famous T@@ har@@ gel@@ ia , another renowned Ionian het@@ a@@ era of ancient times .
being a foreig@@ ner and possibly a het@@ a@@ era , A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia was free of the legal restra@@ ints that traditionally con@@ fined married women to their homes , and there@@ by was allowed to participate in the public life of the city .
A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia would have to have been quite young , if she were able to bear a child to Ly@@ sic@@ les c . 4@@ 28 BC .
in social circles , A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia was noted for her ability as a convers@@ ationalist and adviser rather than mer@@ ely an object of physical beauty .
Donald K@@ ag@@ an , a Y@@ ale histor@@ ian , believes that A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia was particularly un@@ popular in the years immediately following the Sam@@ ian War .
in 440 BC , Sam@@ os was at war with Mil@@ et@@ us over Pri@@ ene , an ancient city of Ion@@ ia in the fo@@ ot @@@ -@@ @ hil@@ ls of My@@ cal@@ e .
before the erup@@ tion of the P@@ elop@@ on@@ nes@@ ian War ( 4@@ 31 BC @@@ -@@ @ 4@@ 04 BC ) , Per@@ ic@@ les , some of his closest associates and A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia faced a series of personal and legal attacks .
A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia , in particular , was accused of cor@@ rup@@ ting the women of Athens in order to satisfy Per@@ ic@@ les ' per@@ ver@@ sions .
although A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia was acquitted thanks to a rare emo@@ tional out@@ bur@@ st of Per@@ ic@@ les , his friend , P@@ hi@@ di@@ as , died in prison .

K@@ ag@@ an argues that even if we believe these stories , A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia was un@@ har@@ med with or without the help of Per@@ ic@@ les .
according to Pod@@ lec@@ ki , Do@@ ur@@ is appears to have pro@@ po@@ unded the view that A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia in@@ sti@@ g@@ ated both the Sam@@ ian and P@@ elop@@ on@@ nes@@ ian W@@ ars .
A@@ sp@@ as@@ ia was la@@ be@@ led the " New O@@ mp@@ hale , " " De@@ ian@@ ira , " " Her@@ a " and " H@@ elen . "

second , and more important , was the level and quality of investment that pers@@ isted through the 1980s .
Japanese businesses imported the latest technologies to develop the industrial base .
in the 197@@ 0s and 1980s , Japan improved its industrial base through technology licen@@ sing , pat@@ ent purchases , and im@@ itation and improvement of foreign in@@ ven@@ tions .
Japan 's la@@ bor force contributed significantly to economic growth , not only because of its avail@@ ability and literacy but also because of its reasonable wage demands .
high productivity growth played a key role in pos@@ tw@@ ar economic growth .
the Co@@ ordination of activities within these group@@ ings and the integration of smaller sub@@ contractors into the groups enhanced industrial efficiency .

in its simp@@ lest form , a star network consists of one central switch , hub or computer , which acts as a con@@ du@@ it to trans@@ mit messages .
this consists of a central no@@ de , to which all other no@@ des are connected ; this central no@@ de provides a common connection point for all no@@ des through a hub .
in star top@@ ology , every no@@ de ( computer work@@ station or any other per@@ ip@@ h@@ eral ) is connected to a central no@@ de called a hub or switch .
an " active " star network has an active central no@@ de that usually has the means to prevent ech@@ o @@@ -@@ @ related problems .
it is also designed with each no@@ de ( file ser@@ vers , work@@ stations , and per@@ ip@@ her@@ als ) connected directly to a central network hub , switch , or concentr@@ ator .
data on a star network passes through the hub , switch , or concentr@@ ator before continuing to its destination .
the hub , switch , or concentr@@ ator man@@ ages and controls all functions of the network .
it also acts as a repe@@ ater for the data flow .
this config@@ ur@@ ation is common with tw@@ isted pair cable .
however , it can also be used with co@@ ax@@ ial cable or op@@ tical fi@@ bre cable .
at most , 3 devices and 2 links are involved in any communication between any two devices .
although this top@@ ology places a huge over@@ head on the central hub , with adequate capacity , the hub can handle very high u@@ tili@@ z@@ ation by one device without affecting others .
* I@@ so@@ lation of devices : each device is inher@@ ently isolated by the link that connec@@ ts it to the hub .
this makes the isolation of individual devices stra@@ ight@@ forward and amounts to dis@@ connecting each device from the others .
* benefits from central@@ ization : as the central hub is the bott@@ len@@ ec@@ k , increasing its capacity , or connecting additional devices to it , increases the size of the network very easily .
this facilit@@ ates analysis of the traffic and detection of suspicious behavi@@ or .
* E@@ asy to detec@@ t fa@@ ults and to remove parts .
* instal@@ lation and config@@ ur@@ ation is easy since every one device only requires a link and one in@@ put / output port to connect it to any other device ( s ) .

this controversy cen@@ tered upon the nature of the Son of God , and his precise relationship to God the F@@ ather .
the express purpose of Alexander 's letter was to complain of the doc@@ tr@@ ines that Ari@@ us was spreading but his charge of her@@ es@@ y against Ari@@ us is v@@ ague and un@@ supported by other authorities .

= = E@@ arly life = = = = = Family = = = Lu@@ ci@@ us Dom@@ iti@@ us Ah@@ en@@ o@@ bar@@ bus , the future Ner@@ o , was born on 15 December 37 in Anti@@ um ( modern An@@ z@@ io and Net@@ tun@@ o ) , near Rome .
he was the only son of G@@ na@@ e@@ us Dom@@ iti@@ us Ah@@ en@@ o@@ bar@@ bus and Agri@@ p@@ p@@ ina the younger , sister of Em@@ per@@ or Cal@@ ig@@ ula .
Ner@@ o 's father was described by Su@@ et@@ on@@ i@@ us as a mur@@ der@@ er and a che@@ at who was charged by Em@@ per@@ or Ti@@ ber@@ i@@ us with tre@@ ason , ad@@ ul@@ tery and In@@ c@@ est .
Ner@@ o 's mother was Agri@@ p@@ p@@ ina the younger , a great @@@ -@@ @ grand@@ daughter of Ca@@ es@@ ar Aug@@ ust@@ us and his wife S@@ cri@@ bon@@ ia through their daughter Jul@@ ia the el@@ der and her husband Mar@@ cus V@@ ip@@ san@@ i@@ us Agri@@ p@@ pa .
Agri@@ p@@ p@@ ina 's father , German@@ ic@@ us , was a grand@@ son of Aug@@ ust@@ us 's wife , Li@@ via , on one side and to Mark Anton@@ y and Oc@@ tav@@ ia on the other .
German@@ ic@@ us ' mother Anton@@ ia minor , was a daughter of Oc@@ tav@@ ia minor and Mark Anton@@ y .
German@@ ic@@ us was also the adopted son of Ti@@ ber@@ i@@ us .
Cal@@ ig@@ ula , his wife Ca@@ es@@ on@@ ia and their inf@@ ant daughter Jul@@ ia Dr@@ us@@ il@@ la were murdered on 24 January 41 .
these events led Clau@@ di@@ us , Cal@@ ig@@ ula 's un@@ cle , to become em@@ per@@ or .
Clau@@ di@@ us had married twice before mar@@ rying Val@@ er@@ ia M@@ ess@@ al@@ ina .
his previous marri@@ ages produced three children including a son , Dr@@ us@@ us , who died at a young age .
he had two children with M@@ ess@@ al@@ ina - Clau@@ dia Oc@@ tav@@ ia ( born 40 ) and Brit@@ ann@@ ic@@ us ( born 41 ) .
M@@ ess@@ al@@ ina was executed by Clau@@ di@@ us in the year 48 .
to aid Clau@@ di@@ us politically , young Ner@@ o was adopted in 50 and took the name Ner@@ o Clau@@ di@@ us Ca@@ es@@ ar Dr@@ us@@ us German@@ ic@@ us ( see adoption in Rome ) .
Ner@@ o was older than his ste@@ p@@ brother Brit@@ ann@@ ic@@ us , and thus became he@@ ir to the th@@ r@@ one .
Ner@@ o was proclaimed an ad@@ ult in 51 at the age of 14 .
in 53 , he married his ste@@ p@@ sister Clau@@ dia Oc@@ tav@@ ia .
very early in Ner@@ o 's rule , problems ar@@ ose from competition for influence between Agri@@ p@@ p@@ ina and Ner@@ o 's two main advisers , Sen@@ ec@@ a and Bur@@ ru@@ s .
Ner@@ o was reportedly un@@ satisfied with his marriage to Oc@@ tav@@ ia and entered into an affair with Clau@@ dia Ac@@ te , a former sla@@ ve .
in 55 , Agri@@ p@@ p@@ ina attempted to intervene in fav@@ or of Oc@@ tav@@ ia and demanded that her son dismiss Ac@@ te .
Ner@@ o , with the support of Sen@@ ec@@ a , res@@ isted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs .
according to T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , Agri@@ p@@ p@@ ina hoped that with her support , Brit@@ ann@@ ic@@ us , being the blood son of Clau@@ di@@ us , would be seen as the true he@@ ir to the th@@ r@@ one by the state over Ner@@ o .
after the death of Brit@@ ann@@ ic@@ us , Agri@@ p@@ p@@ ina was accused of s@@ lan@@ dering Oc@@ tav@@ ia and Ner@@ o ordered her out of the im@@ per@@ ial residence .
in 55 , he removed Mar@@ cus Anton@@ i@@ us Pal@@ las , an ally of Agri@@ p@@ p@@ ina , from his position in the treas@@ ury .
Pal@@ las , along with Bur@@ ru@@ s , was accused of consp@@ iring against the Em@@ per@@ or to bring Fa@@ ust@@ us Sul@@ la to the th@@ r@@ one .
Sen@@ ec@@ a succeeded in having himself , Pal@@ las and Bur@@ ru@@ s acquitted .
in 58 , Ner@@ o became roman@@ tically involved with Pop@@ pa@@ ea Sab@@ ina , the wife of his friend and future em@@ per@@ or O@@ th@@ o .
reportedly because a marriage to Pop@@ pa@@ ea and a div@@ or@@ ce from Oc@@ tav@@ ia did not seem politically feasible with Agri@@ p@@ p@@ ina alive , Ner@@ o ordered the murder of his mother in 59 .
Sen@@ ec@@ a asked Ner@@ o for permission to re@@ tire from public affairs .
after public protests , Ner@@ o was forced to allow Oc@@ tav@@ ia to return from ex@@ ile , but she was executed shortly after her return .
accusations of tre@@ ason being plot@@ ted against Ner@@ o and the Senate first appeared in 62 .
the Senate ruled that Anti@@ sti@@ us , a pra@@ et@@ or , should be put to death for speaking ill of Ner@@ o at a party .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us writes that the roots of the con@@ spir@@ acy led by G@@ ai@@ us Cal@@ pur@@ ni@@ us P@@ is@@ o began in this year .
to consolidate power , Ner@@ o executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals Pal@@ las , Ru@@ bel@@ li@@ us Pla@@ ut@@ us and Fa@@ ust@@ us Sul@@ la .
Ner@@ o began his reign in 54 by promising the Senate more autonomy .
in 55 , Ner@@ o began taking on a more active role as an administr@@ ator .
he was consu@@ l four times between 55 and 60 .
additionally , secret government tax records were ordered to become public .
the festival included games , poetry , and the@@ ater .
in 64 , Rome burned .
Ner@@ o enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction .

it was said that Ner@@ o cra@@ ved the attention , but historians also write that Ner@@ o was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the Senate , his in@@ ner circ@@ le and the people .
Ner@@ o was persu@@ aded to participate in the Olympic Games of 67 in order to improve relations with Greece and display Roman domin@@ ance .
he also performed as an actor and a singer .

= = = E@@ arly life = = = Robert Ho@@ oke was born in 16@@ 35 in fres@@ h@@ water on the Is@@ le of W@@ ight to John Ho@@ oke and Cec@@ ily Gy@@ les .
Robert was the last of four children , two boys and two girls , and there was an age difference of seven years between him and the next youngest .
Robert Ho@@ oke was expected to succeed in his education and join the Church .
as a youth , Robert Ho@@ oke was fas@@ cin@@ ated by ob@@ servation , mechan@@ ical works , and drawing , interests that he would pursue in various ways throughout his life .
it appears that Ho@@ oke was one of a group of students whom Bus@@ by educated in parallel to the main work of the school .
contemporary accounts say he was " not much seen " in the school , and this appears to be true of others in a similar position .
= = = O@@ x@@ ford = = = In 16@@ 53 , Ho@@ oke ( who had also undertaken a course of twenty lessons on the organ ) secured a ch@@ or@@ ister 's place at Ch@@ r@@ ist Church , O@@ x@@ ford .
he was employed as a " chemical assistant " to D@@ r Thomas Wil@@ lis , for whom Ho@@ oke developed a great ad@@ mir@@ ation .
in 16@@ 59 Ho@@ oke described some elements of a method of he@@ avier @@@ -@@ @ than @@@ -@@ @ air flight to W@@ ilk@@ ins , but concluded that human mus@@ c@@ les were insufficient to the task .
W@@ ad@@ ham was then under the gu@@ idance of John W@@ ilk@@ ins , who had a pro@@ found impact on Ho@@ oke and those around him .
W@@ ilk@@ ins was also a R@@ oy@@ alist , and ac@@ utely con@@ sci@@ ous of the turmoil and uncertainty of the times .
there was a sense of ur@@ gency in preserving the scientific work which they perceived as being threatened by the protec@@ torate .
W@@ ilk@@ ins ' " phil@@ osoph@@ ical meetings " in his study were clearly important , though few records survive except for the experim@@ ents Boy@@ le conducted in 16@@ 58 and published in 16@@ 60 .
this group went on to form the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us of the Royal Society .
" it is known that Ho@@ oke had a particularly keen eye , and was an ade@@ pt ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian , neither of which applied to Boy@@ le .
regardless , it is clear that Ho@@ oke was a valued assistant to Boy@@ le and the two re@@ tained a mutual high regard .
on 5 November 16@@ 61 , S@@ ir Robert Mor@@ ay proposed that a cur@@ ator be appointed to fur@@ nish the society with experim@@ ents , and this was unanimously passed with Ho@@ oke being named .
on 27 June 16@@ 64 he was confirmed to the office , and on 11 January 16@@ 65 was named " cur@@ ator by Office " for life with an additional salary of £ 30 to C@@ ut@@ ler 's ann@@ u@@ ity .
there were also experim@@ ents on the subject of gra@@ vity , the falling of objects , the weigh@@ ing of bodies and measuring of baro@@ metric pressure at different he@@ ights , and pen@@ dul@@ ums up to .
on 20 March 16@@ 64 , Ho@@ oke succeeded Ar@@ th@@ ur Dac@@ res as G@@ res@@ ham Professor of geo@@ me@@ try .

J@@ enk@@ ins concluded ... " this story must be om@@ it@@ ted from the history of the ste@@ am engine , at any rate until documentary evidence is forthcoming .
" in the interven@@ ing years since 19@@ 36 no such evidence has been found , but the story pers@@ ists .
his reputation suffered after his death and this is popular@@ ly attributed to a dispute with I@@ sa@@ ac New@@ ton over credit for his work on gra@@ v@@ itation , the plan@@ ets and to a les@@ ser degree light .
Ho@@ oke 's reputation was revi@@ ved during the tw@@ enti@@ eth century through studies of Robert Gun@@ ther and Margar@@ et ' E@@ sp@@ in@@ as@@ se .
after a long period of relative ob@@ sc@@ urity he has now been recognised as one of the most important scientists of his age .
this was a time of im@@ men@@ se scientific progress , and numerous ideas were developed in several places simultaneously .
his ideas about gra@@ v@@ itation , and his claim of priority for the in@@ verse square law , are outlined below .
for example , Ar@@ th@@ ur Ber@@ ry said that Ho@@ oke " claimed credit for most of the scientific discover@@ ies of the time .
the publication of Ho@@ oke 's di@@ ary in 19@@ 35 revealed other sides of the man that ' E@@ sp@@ in@@ as@@ se , in particular , has detailed carefully .
" Ho@@ oke inter@@ acted with noted craf@@ ts@@ men such as Thomas Tom@@ p@@ ion , the c@@ loc@@ k@@ maker , and Christopher Co@@ cks ( Co@@ x ) , an instrument maker .
Ho@@ oke often met Christopher W@@ ren , with whom he shared many interests , and had a lasting friendship with John A@@ ub@@ rey .
he took tea on many occasions with his lab assistant , Harry Hun@@ t .
within his family , Ho@@ oke took both a ni@@ ece and a co@@ us@@ in into his home , teaching them ma@@ them@@ atics .
Robert Ho@@ oke spent his life largely on the Is@@ le of W@@ ight , at O@@ x@@ ford , and in London .
on 3 March 17@@ 03 , Ho@@ oke died in London , having am@@ ass@@ ed a siz@@ able sum of money , which was found in his room at G@@ res@@ ham College .
this was a method sometimes used by scientists , such as Ho@@ oke , H@@ uy@@ gen@@ s , Gal@@ il@@ e@@ o , and others , to establish priority for a discovery without reve@@ aling details .
Ho@@ oke became cur@@ ator of experim@@ ents in 16@@ 62 to the newly founded Royal Society , and took responsibility for experim@@ ents performed at its weekly meetings .
this was a position he held for over 40 years .
in 16@@ 64 Ho@@ oke also was appointed Professor of geo@@ me@@ try at G@@ res@@ ham College in London and C@@ ut@@ ler@@ ian lec@@ turer in Mec@@ han@@ ics .
on 8 July 16@@ 80 , Ho@@ oke observed the no@@ dal pat@@ ter@@ ns associated with the mo@@ des of vi@@ br@@ ation of glass plates .
D@@ ug@@ ald Ste@@ war@@ t , in his " Ele@@ ments of the Phil@@ osophy of the Human Min@@ d , " quoted Ho@@ oke 's own words on his system of the world .
" I will explain , " says Ho@@ oke , in a communication to the Royal Society in 16@@ 66 , " a system of the world very different from any yet received .
Ho@@ oke 's statements up to 16@@ 74 made no mention , however , that an in@@ verse square law applies or might apply to these attr@@ actions .
Ho@@ oke also did not provide accompan@@ ying evidence or ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal demonstration .
in November 16@@ 79 , Ho@@ oke initiated a remarkable exchange of letters with New@@ ton ( of which the full text is now published ) .
on the other hand , New@@ ton did accept and acknowledge , in all edi@@ tions of the ' Pr@@ in@@ cip@@ ia ' , that Ho@@ oke ( but not exclusively Ho@@ oke ) had separately appreci@@ ated the in@@ verse square law in the solar system .
New@@ ton acknowledged W@@ ren , Ho@@ oke and Hal@@ ley in this connection in the Sch@@ ol@@ ium to pro@@ position 4 in Book 1 .
= = = = an@@ ch@@ or Es@@ cap@@ ement = = = = In 16@@ 55 , according to his auto@@ bio@@ graphical notes , Ho@@ oke began to acqu@@ ain@@ t himself with astr@@ onomy , through the good offices of John W@@ ard .
" William Der@@ ham also attribu@@ tes it to Ho@@ oke .
= = = Mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ y = = = In 16@@ 65 Ho@@ oke published " Mic@@ ro@@ grap@@ hi@@ a , " a book describing ob@@ serv@@ ations made with mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es and tele@@ sc@@ op@@ es , as well as some original work in bi@@ ology .
" Mic@@ ro@@ grap@@ hi@@ a " also contains Ho@@ oke 's , or perhaps Boy@@ le and Ho@@ oke 's , ideas on comb@@ us@@ tion .
Part@@ ington even goes so far as to claim that if " Ho@@ oke had continued his experim@@ ents on comb@@ us@@ tion it is prob@@ able that he would have discovered ox@@ y@@ gen . "

= = = Astr@@ onomy = = = One of the more @@@ -@@ @ challenging problems tack@@ led by Ho@@ oke was the meas@@ urement of the distance to a star ( other than the S@@ un ) .
the star chosen was gam@@ ma Drac@@ on@@ is and the method to be used was paral@@ la@@ x determination .
after several months of obser@@ ving , in 16@@ 69 , Ho@@ oke believed that the desi@@ red result had been achieved .
it is now known that Ho@@ oke 's equipment was far too imp@@ rec@@ ise to allow the meas@@ urement to succeed .

= = = Mem@@ ory = = = A les@@ ser @@@ -@@ @ known contribution , however one of the first of its kind , was Ho@@ oke 's scientific model of human memory .
Ho@@ oke in a 16@@ 82 lec@@ ture to the Royal Society proposed a mechan@@ istic model of human memory , which would bear little res@@ em@@ b@@ lance to the mainly phil@@ osoph@@ ical models before it .
this lec@@ ture would be published pos@@ thum@@ ously in 17@@ 05 as the memory model was un@@ usually placed in a series of works on the nature of light .
Ho@@ oke 's collaboration with Christopher W@@ ren also included St Paul 's Cath@@ edr@@ al , whose d@@ ome uses a method of construction conce@@ ived by Ho@@ oke .
Ho@@ oke also participated in the design of the Pep@@ ys Library , which held the man@@ us@@ cripts of Samuel Pep@@ ys ' di@@ aries , the most frequently cited eye@@ witness account of the Great F@@ ire of London .
this proposal was thwar@@ ted by arguments over property rights , as property owners were sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ ti@@ ously shif@@ ting their boundaries .
for an extensive study of Ho@@ oke 's architectural work , see the book by Cooper .
in Ho@@ oke 's time , the Royal Society met at G@@ res@@ ham College , but within a few months of Ho@@ oke 's death New@@ ton became the Society 's president and plans were laid for a new meeting place .
however , when the source was tr@@ ac@@ ed by Ash@@ ley Mont@@ ag@@ u , it was found to lack a ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able connection to Ho@@ oke .
in 2003 , histor@@ ian Lis@@ a J@@ ard@@ ine claimed that a recently discovered por@@ tra@@ it was of Ho@@ oke , but this claim was dis@@ proved by William J@@ ensen of the University of C@@ inc@@ in@@ n@@ ati .

Johan@@ nes K@@ ep@@ ler ( ; December 27 , 15@@ 71 - November 15 , 16@@ 30 ) was a German ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian , as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer , and astr@@ olo@@ ger .
these works also provided one of the foundations for I@@ sa@@ ac New@@ ton 's theory of universal gra@@ v@@ itation .
he was also a ma@@ them@@ atics teacher in Lin@@ z , Austria , and an adviser to General Wal@@ len@@ stein .
his grand@@ father , S@@ eb@@ ald K@@ ep@@ ler , had been Lord Mayor of that town but , by the time Johan@@ nes was born , he had two brothers and one sister and the K@@ ep@@ ler family fortun@@ e was in decline .
his father , Hein@@ rich K@@ ep@@ ler , earned a prec@@ ar@@ ious living as a mer@@ cen@@ ary , and he left the family when Johan@@ nes was five years old .
in 15@@ 89 , after moving through gram@@ mar school , Latin school , and semin@@ ary at Ma@@ ul@@ bron@@ n , K@@ ep@@ ler attended T@@ üb@@ inger Sti@@ ft at the University of T@@ üb@@ ing@@ en .
under the in@@ struction of Michael Ma@@ est@@ lin , T@@ üb@@ ing@@ en 's professor of ma@@ them@@ atics from 15@@ 83 to 16@@ 31 , he learned both the P@@ to@@ le@@ ma@@ ic system and the C@@ oper@@ nic@@ an system of plan@@ etary motion .
after failing to find a unique arrangement of pol@@ y@@ g@@ ons that fit known astronom@@ ical ob@@ serv@@ ations ( even with extra plan@@ ets added to the system ) , K@@ ep@@ ler began experim@@ enting with 3 @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional pol@@ y@@ h@@ ed@@ ra .
however , K@@ ep@@ ler later rejected this formula , because it was not precise enough .
as he indicated in the title , K@@ ep@@ ler thought he had revealed God 's geo@@ metri@@ cal plan for the Uni@@ verse .

in terms of the impact of " My@@ ster@@ ium , " it can be seen as an important first step in moderniz@@ ing the theory proposed by Nicola@@ us C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us in his " De Revol@@ u@@ tion@@ i@@ bus . "
" modern astr@@ onomy owes much to " My@@ ster@@ ium Cos@@ mo@@ graph@@ ic@@ um , " despite f@@ laws in its main th@@ es@@ is , " since it represents the first step in cleansing the C@@ oper@@ nic@@ an system of the re@@ mn@@ ants of the P@@ to@@ le@@ ma@@ ic theory still cl@@ inging to it .

= = = O@@ ther research = = = Fol@@ low@@ ing the publication of " My@@ ster@@ ium " and with the b@@ les@@ sing of the G@@ raz school inspectors , K@@ ep@@ ler began an ambitious program to extend and elabor@@ ate his work .
through their letters , T@@ y@@ cho and K@@ ep@@ ler discussed a broad range of astronom@@ ical problems , d@@ wel@@ ling on lun@@ ar phenom@@ ena and C@@ oper@@ nic@@ an theory ( particularly its the@@ ological vi@@ ability ) .
but without the significantly more accur@@ ate data of T@@ y@@ cho 's observatory , K@@ ep@@ ler had no way to address many of these issues .
K@@ ep@@ ler planned to test his theory from " My@@ ster@@ ium Cos@@ mo@@ graph@@ ic@@ um " based on the Mar@@ s data , but he estimated that the work would take up to two years ( since he was not allowed to simply cop@@ y the data for his own use ) .
K@@ ep@@ ler and T@@ y@@ cho soon reconc@@ iled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements , and in June , K@@ ep@@ ler returned home to G@@ raz to collect his family .
though the es@@ say did not earn him a place in Fer@@ din@@ and 's court , it did detail a new method for measuring lun@@ ar ec@@ li@@ p@@ ses , which he applied during the July 10 ec@@ li@@ p@@ se in G@@ raz .
these ob@@ serv@@ ations formed the basis of his expl@@ or@@ ations of the laws of op@@ tics that would culmin@@ ate in " Astr@@ onom@@ i@@ a@@ e Par@@ s Op@@ tica . "
on August 2 , 1@@ 600 , after refusing to conver@@ t to Cathol@@ ic@@ ism , K@@ ep@@ ler and his family were ban@@ ished from G@@ raz .

the radi@@ an is the standard unit of an@@ gular measure , used in many areas of ma@@ them@@ atics .
an an@@ gle 's meas@@ urement in radi@@ ans is num@@ er@@ ically equal to the length of a correspon@@ ding Ar@@ c of a unit circ@@ le , one radi@@ an is just under 5@@ 7.@@ 3 degrees ( when the Ar@@ c length is equal to the radi@@ us ) .
the unit was formerly an SI supp@@ le@@ mentary unit , but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radi@@ an is now considered an SI der@@ ived unit .
the radi@@ an is represented by the symbol R@@ ad ( Un@@ ic@@ o@@ de @@@ -@@ @ en@@ co@@ ded as ) .
an alternative symbol is the super@@ s@@ cri@@ pt letter c , for " cir@@ cular measure " - but this is inf@@ requ@@ ently used as it can be easily mist@@ ak@@ en for a degree symbol ( ° ) .
so for example , a value of 1.2 radi@@ ans could be written as 1.2 R@@ ad , 1.2 , or 1.2 .
as the rati@@ o of two leng@@ ths , the radi@@ an is a " p@@ ure number " that needs no unit symbol , and in ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal writing the symbol " R@@ ad " is almost always om@@ it@@ ted .
the idea of measuring ang@@ les by the length of the Ar@@ c was already in use by other ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cians .
for example al @@@ -@@ @ Kas@@ hi ( c . 1@@ 400 ) used so @@@ -@@ @ called " di@@ ame@@ ter parts " as units where one di@@ ame@@ ter part was radi@@ an and they also used sex@@ ag@@ es@@ imal su@@ bun@@ its of the di@@ ame@@ ter part .
in 18@@ 74 , after a consultation with James Thom@@ son , Mu@@ ir adopted " radi@@ an . "
thus , to conver@@ t from radi@@ ans to degrees , multi@@ ply by 180 / π .
in all such cases it is found that the arguments to the functions are most n@@ atur@@ ally written in the form that correspon@@ ds , in geo@@ metri@@ cal con@@ tex@@ ts , to the radi@@ an meas@@ urement of ang@@ les .
although po@@ lar and sp@@ her@@ ical co@@ ordin@@ ates use radi@@ ans to describe co@@ ordin@@ ates in two and three dimen@@ sions , the unit is der@@ ived from the radi@@ us co@@ ordinate , so the an@@ gle measure is still dimen@@ sion@@ less .
= = U@@ se in physi@@ cs = = The radi@@ an is widely used in physi@@ cs when an@@ gular meas@@ ure@@ ments are required .
for example , an@@ gular v@@ el@@ o@@ city is typically meas@@ ured in radi@@ ans per second ( R@@ ad / s ) .
similarly , an@@ gular acceler@@ ation is often meas@@ ured in radi@@ ans per second per second ( R@@ ad / s@@ 2 ) .
for the purpose of dimen@@ sional analysis , the units are s − 1 and s − 2 respectively .
likewise , the phase difference of two waves can also be meas@@ ured in radi@@ ans .
a milli@@ radi@@ an ( m@@ ra@@ d ) is a thous@@ and@@ th of a radi@@ an and a mic@@ r@@ or@@ adi@@ an ( ur@@ ad or μ@@ ra@@ d ) is a milli@@ on@@ th of a radi@@ an , i@@ .@@ e@@ .
there are 2@@ π × 1000 milli@@ radi@@ ans ( ≈ 6@@ 2@@ 8@@ 3.@@ 18@@ 5 m@@ ra@@ d ) in a circ@@ le .
an approxim@@ ation of the trig@@ on@@ o@@ metric milli@@ radi@@ an ( 0.@@ 0@@ 01 R@@ ad ) , known as the ( an@@ gular ) M@@ il , is used by NATO and other military organiz@@ ations in gun@@ ner@@ y and targeting .
for the small ang@@ les typically found in targeting work , the conven@@ i@@ ence of using the number 6@@ 400 in calc@@ ulation out@@ weigh@@ s the small ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal err@@ ors it introdu@@ ces .
being based on the milli@@ radi@@ an , the NATO M@@ il sub@@ ten@@ ds roughly 1 m at a range of 1000 m ( at such small ang@@ les , the cur@@ vat@@ ure is neg@@ li@@ gible ) .
smaller units like mic@@ r@@ or@@ adi@@ ans ( μ@@ ra@@ d ) and n@@ an@@ or@@ adi@@ ans ( n@@ ra@@ d ) are used in astr@@ onomy , and can also be used to measure the be@@ am quality of las@@ ers with ultra @@@ -@@ @ low di@@ ver@@ gence .

= = E@@ arly life = = Louis Ag@@ as@@ siz was born in M@@ ô@@ ti@@ er ( now part of Ha@@ ut @@@ -@@ @ Vul@@ ly ) in the can@@ ton of Fri@@ bourg , Switzerland .
in 18@@ 29 he received the degree of Do@@ c@@ tor of Phil@@ osophy at Er@@ lan@@ gen , and in 18@@ 30 that of doctor of medicine at Mun@@ ich .
Sp@@ i@@ x , who died in 18@@ 26 , did not live long enough to work out the history of these fish , and Ag@@ as@@ siz ( though fresh out of school ) was selected by Mar@@ ti@@ us for this purpose .
the fos@@ sil fish there soon attracted his attention .
Ag@@ as@@ siz , as early as 18@@ 29 , planned the publication of the work which , more than any other , laid the foundation of his worldwide f@@ ame .
five vol@@ u@@ mes of his " Rec@@ her@@ ches sur les po@@ is@@ sons fos@@ siles " ( " Research on fos@@ sil F@@ ish " ) appeared at inter@@ vals from 18@@ 33 to 18@@ 43 .
in gathering materials for this work Ag@@ as@@ siz visited the principal museums in Europe , and meeting Cu@@ vi@@ er in Paris , he received much encour@@ agement and assistance from him .
while Ag@@ as@@ siz did much to place the subject on a scientific basis , this clas@@ si@@ fication has been super@@ se@@ ded by later work .
the British Association came to his aid , and the Ear@@ l of El@@ le@@ sm@@ ere - then Lord Franc@@ is E@@ ger@@ ton - gave him yet more efficient help .
the 1,@@ 2@@ 90 original dra@@ w@@ ings made for the work were purchased by the Ear@@ l , and presented by him to the Ge@@ ological Society of London .
the st@@ range forms of the " P@@ ter@@ ich@@ th@@ ys , " the " Co@@ cc@@ os@@ te@@ us " and other Gener@@ a were then made known to ge@@ ologists for the first time .
these la@@ bour@@ s resulted , in 18@@ 40 , in the publication of his work in two vol@@ u@@ mes entitled " E@@ tu@@ des sur les gla@@ ci@@ ers " ( " Studies on Gla@@ ci@@ ers " ) .
thus famili@@ ar@@ ized with the phenom@@ ena associated with the movements of recent gla@@ ci@@ ers , Ag@@ as@@ siz was prepared for a discovery which he made in 18@@ 40 , in con@@ jun@@ ction with William Buc@@ k@@ land .
in 18@@ 52 he accepted a medical profes@@ sor@@ ship of compar@@ ative an@@ at@@ om@@ y at Char@@ le@@ sto@@ wn , Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , but he resigned in two years .
during this time he also published a cat@@ alo@@ g of papers in his field , " Bi@@ b@@ li@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ a Zo@@ olo@@ gi@@ a@@ e et Ge@@ olo@@ gi@@ a@@ e , " in four vol@@ u@@ mes between 18@@ 48 and 18@@ 54 .
in 18@@ 63 , Ag@@ as@@ siz 's daughter I@@ DA married Henry Le@@ e Hig@@ gin@@ son , later to be founder of the Bos@@ ton S@@ ymp@@ h@@ ony Orchestra and benef@@ actor to Har@@ vard University and other schools .
he died in C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge , Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts in 18@@ 73 and was buried at Mount A@@ ub@@ ur@@ n C@@ eme@@ tery , joined later by his wife .
the school 's name was changed to the Maria L@@ . Bal@@ d@@ win School on May 21 , 2002 , due to concerns about Ag@@ as@@ siz 's rac@@ ism , and to hon@@ or Maria Lou@@ ise Bal@@ d@@ win the African @@@ -@@ @ American principal of the school who served from 18@@ 89 until 19@@ 22 .

Johan@@ na Sp@@ y@@ ri ( ; 12 June 18@@ 27 - 7 July 19@@ 01 ) was a Swiss @@@ -@@ @ born author of children 's stories , and is best known for her book " He@@ idi . "
= = Bi@@ o@@ graphy = = In 18@@ 52 , Johan@@ na He@@ us@@ ser married Bern@@ hard Sp@@ y@@ ri , a lawyer .
Wil@@ lar@@ d Car@@ rol@@ l " Will " S@@ mit@@ h , J@@ r . ( born September 25 , 19@@ 68 ) is an American actor , producer , rap@@ per , and son@@ g@@ writer .
it is the non @@@ -@@ @ living component of cell .
the Sas@@ san@@ ids ' cultural influence extended far beyond the emp@@ ire 's territorial borders , reaching as far as Western Europe , Africa , China and India .
it played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asian medieval art .
the city , well supported by high mountains and easily defen@@ dable through narrow passes , became the cen@@ ter of Ar@@ d@@ as@@ hir 's efforts to gain more power .
this friendship was advant@@ age@@ ous for the Jewish community and gave them a res@@ p@@ ite from the op@@ pres@@ sive laws enacted against them .
he cr@@ us@@ hed the Central Asian tri@@ bes , and an@@ ne@@ xed the area as a new province .
he completed the con@@ quest of the area now known as Afghanistan .
S@@ hap@@ ur II pursu@@ ed a harsh religious policy .
like him , he was powerful both physi@@ cally and diplom@@ atically .
like Constan@@ tine the Great , Y@@ az@@ de@@ ger@@ d I prac@@ ticed religious tolerance and provided freedom for the rise of religious minorities .
he also married a Jewish pr@@ inc@@ ess who b@@ ore him a son called N@@ ar@@ si .
he symbol@@ ized a king at the he@@ ight of a golden age .
the Armenians , however , remained primarily Christian .
in his later years , he was engaged yet again with K@@ idar@@ ites until his death in 4@@ 57 .
these attacks brought instability and chaos to the k@@ ing@@ dom .
after this victory , the Hep@@ h@@ th@@ ali@@ tes advanced forward to the city of Her@@ at , thro@@ wing the emp@@ ire into chaos .
eventually , a no@@ ble Per@@ sian from the old family of Kar@@ en , Zar@@ m@@ ih@@ r ( or Sok@@ h@@ ra ) , restored some degree of order .
the army was met by the Roman general Bel@@ is@@ ar@@ i@@ us , and though super@@ ior in numbers , was defeated at the B@@ attle of D@@ ara .
Sa@@ if , son of Mar@@ d @@@ -@@ @ Kar@@ i@@ b , who had accompanied the expedition , became King some@@ time between 5@@ 75 and 5@@ 77 .
thus , the Sas@@ san@@ ids were able to establish a base in south Arabia to control the sea trade with the east .
K@@ hos@@ ra@@ u I was a great buil@@ der , em@@ bel@@ lis@@ hing his capital , founding new towns , and construc@@ ting new buildings .
most of these positions were patri@@ mon@@ ial , and many were passed down through a single family for generations .
cul@@ tur@@ ally , the Sas@@ san@@ ids implemented a system of social str@@ ati@@ fication .
this system was supported by Zor@@ o@@ as@@ tri@@ an@@ ism , which was established as the state religion .
the Sas@@ san@@ ids , similar to the Roman Empire , were in a constant state of conflict with neigh@@ bor@@ ing k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms and n@@ om@@ adi@@ c hor@@ des .
the construction of for@@ ti@@ fic@@ ations such as T@@ us c@@ it@@ ade@@ l or the city of Nis@@ hap@@ ur , which later became a cen@@ ter of learning and trade , also assisted in defending the eastern provinces from attack .
the Sas@@ san@@ ids built numerous for@@ ti@@ fic@@ ations in the Caucasus region to halt these attacks .
commer@@ ci@@ ally , land and sea trade with China was important to both the Sas@@ san@@ id and Chinese Emp@@ ires .
politically , there is evidence of several Sas@@ san@@ id and Chinese efforts in for@@ ging al@@ li@@ ances against the common enemy , the Hep@@ h@@ th@@ ali@@ tes .
lower @@@ -@@ @ level cultural inter@@ changes also took place between India and Per@@ sia during this period .
membership in a class was based on birth , although it was possible for an excep@@ tional individual to move to another class on the basis of mer@@ it .
the Az@@ atan formed a large low @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ist@@ o@@ cracy of low @@@ -@@ @ level administr@@ ators , mostly living on small es@@ ta@@ tes .
much of what later became known as Muslim culture , including architecture and writing , was originally drawn from Per@@ sian culture .
the various Sas@@ anian crow@@ ns demonstrate the cultural , economic , social and historical situation in each period .
the art of this period reve@@ als an ast@@ on@@ ishing vir@@ il@@ ity , in certain respects anticip@@ ating key features of Islamic art .
the con@@ quest of Per@@ sia by Alexander the Great had inaugurated the spread of Hel@@ len@@ istic art into Western Asia .
already in the Parth@@ ian period , Hel@@ len@@ istic art was being interpreted freely by the peoples of the Ne@@ ar East .
throughout the Sas@@ anian period , there was reaction against it .
in addition to local traditions , Parth@@ ian architecture influenced Sas@@ anian architectural character@@ isti@@ cs .
many of the pal@@ aces contain an in@@ ner audience hall consisting , as at Fir@@ uz@@ ab@@ ad , of a chamber sur@@ moun@@ ted by a d@@ ome .
buildings were decor@@ ated with wall paintings .
Gu@@ il@@ ds were numerous .
K@@ hos@@ ra@@ u I further extended the already vast trade network .
the main exports of the Sas@@ an@@ ians were sil@@ k ; woo@@ len and golden tex@@ ti@@ les ; car@@ p@@ ets and ru@@ gs ; hi@@ des ; and , le@@ ather and pe@@ ar@@ ls from the Per@@ sian Gul@@ f .
the extraordinary mineral wealth of the P@@ amir Moun@@ tains on the eastern hor@@ iz@@ on of the Sas@@ anian emp@@ ire led to a legend among the T@@ aj@@ ik@@ s , an Iranian people living there , which is still told today .
S@@ hap@@ ur I ( Sha@@ bu@@ r M@@ alk@@ a in Ar@@ am@@ a@@ ic ) was a particular friend to the Jews .
today there are over 70,000 Zor@@ o@@ as@@ tri@@ ans in India .

art histor@@ ian Patri@@ cia failing said , " The bul@@ l and the hor@@ se are important charac@@ ters in Spanish culture .
their relationship is a kind of ballet that was conce@@ ived in a variety of ways throughout Pic@@ asso 's career .
the Pav@@ il@@ ion 's entrance presented an enormous photo@@ graphic mur@@ al of Republican soldiers accompanied by the slogan : : we are fighting for the essential unity of Spain .
: we are fighting for the independence of our country and for : the right of the Spanish people to determine their own dest@@ in@@ y .
at Pic@@ asso 's request the saf@@ eke@@ eping of the piece was entr@@ usted to the Museum of Modern Art ( Mo@@ MA ) in New York City .
the studies and photos were often lo@@ an@@ ed for other exhibitions , but until 1981 , " Gu@@ er@@ nica " itself remained at Mo@@ MA .
after Franco 's death , Spain was transformed into a democratic constitutional mon@@ archy , ratified by a new constitution in 197@@ 8 .

however , since that time there has never been any attempted vand@@ alism or other security threat to the pain@@ ting .
Bas@@ que nationalists have advoc@@ ated that the picture should be brought to the Bas@@ que country , especially after the building of the G@@ ug@@ gen@@ he@@ im Bil@@ ba@@ o Museum .
even the staff of the G@@ ug@@ gen@@ he@@ im do not see a permanent transfer of the pain@@ ting as possible , although the Bas@@ que government continues to support the possibility of a temporary exhibition in Bil@@ ba@@ o .

in physi@@ cs , a force is said to do work if , when acting on a body , there is a dis@@ placement of the point of application in the direction of the force .
the SI unit of work is the new@@ ton @@@ -@@ @ metre or jo@@ ule ( J ) .
= = Un@@ its = = The SI unit of work is the jo@@ ule ( J ) , which is defined as the work expen@@ ded by a force of one new@@ ton through a distance of one metre .
the dimen@@ sion@@ ally equivalent new@@ ton @@@ -@@ @ metre ( N · m ) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work , but this can be conf@@ used with the unit new@@ ton @@@ -@@ @ metre , which is the meas@@ urement unit of tor@@ que .
due to work having the same physical dimension as heat , occasi@@ onally meas@@ urement units typically reserved for heat or energy content , such as ther@@ m , B@@ TU and Cal@@ or@@ ie , are u@@ tili@@ z@@ ed as a measuring unit .
the work / energy principles discussed here are i@@ den@@ tical to Electric work / energy principles .
this force does zero work because it is per@@ pen@@ dic@@ ular to the v@@ el@@ o@@ city of the ball .
another example is a book on a table .
if external forces are applied to the book so that it sli@@ des on the table , then the force ex@@ er@@ ted by the table constra@@ ins the book from moving down@@ wards .
it can change the direction of motion but never change the speed .
thus , at any in@@ stan@@ t , the rate of the work done by a force ( meas@@ ured in j@@ ou@@ les / second , or wat@@ ts ) is the scal@@ ar product of the force ( a v@@ ec@@ tor ) , and the v@@ el@@ o@@ city v@@ ec@@ tor of the point of application .
work is the result of a force on a point that moves through a distance .
as the point moves , it follows a cur@@ ve X , with a v@@ el@@ o@@ city V , at each in@@ stan@@ t .
the sum of these small amounts of work over the traj@@ ec@@ tory of the point yi@@ elds the work , : formula _ 7@@ where " C " is the traj@@ ec@@ tory from x ( t@@ 1 ) to x ( t@@ 2 ) .
if the force is always directed along this line , and the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of the force is " F , " then this integral simp@@ li@@ fies to : formula _ 8@@ where " s " is distance along the line .
if F is constant , in addition to being directed along the line , then the integral simp@@ li@@ fies further to : formula _ 9@@ where " s " is the distance travelled by the point along the line .
this calc@@ ulation can be general@@ ized for a constant force that is not directed along the line , followed by the parti@@ cle .
thus , no work can be performed by gra@@ vity on a plan@@ et with a cir@@ cular or@@ bit ( this is ideal , as all or@@ bi@@ ts are slightly el@@ li@@ p@@ tical ) .
this integral depends on the rot@@ ational traj@@ ec@@ tory " φ ( t ) , " and is therefore path @@@ -@@ @ dependent .
= = Wor@@ k and potential energy = = The scal@@ ar product of a force F and the v@@ el@@ o@@ city V of its point of application defin@@ es the power in@@ put to a system at an in@@ stan@@ t of time .
integration of this power over the traj@@ ec@@ tory of the point of application , " C " = x ( t ) , defin@@ es the work in@@ put to the system by the force .
examples of forces that have potential ener@@ gies are gra@@ vity and spring forces .
near the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th the acceler@@ ation due to gra@@ vity is G = 9.@@ 8 m@@ .@@ s − 2 and the gra@@ vit@@ ational force on an object of mass m is F@@ g = " M@@ G . "
it is conven@@ i@@ ent to imag@@ ine this gra@@ vit@@ ational force concentrated at the cen@@ ter of mass of the object .
no@@ tice that the work done by gra@@ vity depends only on the ver@@ tical movement of the object .
the negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy .
this also means the constra@@ int forces do not add to the in@@ stan@@ tane@@ ous power .
this section focuses on the work @@@ -@@ @ energy principle as it applies to parti@@ cle dynam@@ ics .
in more general systems work can change the potential energy of a mechan@@ ical device , the heat energy in a thermal system , or the electrical energy in an electrical device .
work trans@@ fers energy from one place to another or one form to another .
the work of the net force is calculated as the product of its mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de and the parti@@ cle dis@@ placement .
to see this , consider a parti@@ cle P that follows the traj@@ ec@@ tory X ( t ) with a force F acting on it .
this can also be written as : formula _ 5@@ 4@@ This integral is compu@@ ted along the traj@@ ec@@ tory X ( t ) of the parti@@ cle and is therefore path dependent .
let the traj@@ ec@@ tory of the vehicle following the road be X ( t ) which is a cur@@ ve in three @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional space .
no@@ tice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle .
to see this , let the forces F@@ 1 , F@@ 2 ... F@@ n act on the points X@@ 1 , X@@ 2 ... X@@ n in a ri@@ g@@ id body .
the traj@@ ec@@ tories of X@@ i , i = 1 ... , n are defined by the movement of the ri@@ g@@ id body .

it is not easy to distingu@@ ish micro@@ finance from similar activities .
ensuring financial services to poor people is best done by expanding the number of financial institutions available to them , as well as by strengthening the capacity of those institutions .
in recent years there has also been increasing emphasis on expanding the diversity of institutions , since different institutions serve different needs .
# micro@@ finance also means integr@@ ating the financial needs of poor people into a country 's mainstream financial system .
# " The job of government is to enable financial services , not to provide them .
" # " The key bott@@ len@@ ec@@ k is the shortage of strong institutions and managers .
families who are de@@ stitute , or so poor they are unlikely to be able to generate the cash flow required to repay a loan , should be recipi@@ ents of charity .
others are best served by financial institutions .

the 8@@ 0@@ 08 was the prec@@ ur@@ sor to the very successful In@@ tel 8@@ 0@@ 80 ( 1974 ) , which offered much improved performance over the 8@@ 0@@ 08 and required fewer support chi@@ ps , Zil@@ o@@ g Z@@ 80 ( 197@@ 6 ) , and der@@ iv@@ ative In@@ tel 8 @@@ -@@ @ bit proc@@ es@@ sors .

the 9@@ 900 was used in the TI 9@@ 90 / 4 min@@ ic@@ om@@ pu@@ ter , the TI @@@ -@@ @ 99 / 4@@ A home computer , and the TM@@ 9@@ 90 line of O@@ E@@ M micro@@ computer boards .
a third c@@ hip , the T@@ MS 9@@ 9@@ 95 , was a new design .
the family later expanded to include the 9@@ 9@@ 1@@ 05 and 9@@ 9@@ 110 .
the Western Des@@ ign Center ( W@@ DC ) introduced the C@@ M@@ OS 6@@ 5@@ 8@@ 16 16 @@@ -@@ @ bit upgrade of the W@@ DC C@@ M@@ OS 6@@ 5@@ C@@ 02 in 1984 .
the 6@@ 5@@ 8@@ 16 16 @@@ -@@ @ bit micro@@ proc@@ essor was the core of the Ap@@ ple I@@ I@@ gs and later the Super N@@ inten@@ do Enter@@ tain@@ ment System , making it one of the most popular 16 @@@ -@@ @ bit design@@ s of all time .
In@@ tel " up@@ sized " their 8@@ 0@@ 80 design into the 16 @@@ -@@ @ bit In@@ tel 8@@ 0@@ 86 , the first member of the x@@ 86 family , which powers most modern PC type computers .
the 8@@ 0@@ 88 , a version of the 8@@ 0@@ 86 that used an 8 @@@ -@@ @ bit external data bus , was the micro@@ proc@@ essor in the first IBM PC .
In@@ tel then released the 8@@ 0@@ 18@@ 6 and 8@@ 0@@ 18@@ 8 , the 8@@ 0@@ 2@@ 86 and , in 1985 , the 32 @@@ -@@ @ bit 8@@ 0@@ 3@@ 86 , cem@@ enting their PC market domin@@ ance with the proc@@ essor family 's back@@ wards compati@@ bility .
the most significant of the 32 @@@ -@@ @ bit design@@ s is the Motor@@ ola MC@@ 6@@ 8@@ 000 , introduced in 1979 .
Motor@@ ola generally described it as a 16 @@@ -@@ @ bit proc@@ essor , though it clearly has 32 @@@ -@@ @ bit capable architecture .
the combination of high performance , large ( 16 me@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes or 2@@ 24 by@@ tes ) memory space and fairly low cost made it the most popular C@@ P@@ U design of its class .
after the div@@ esti@@ ture of AT & T in 1984 , it was ren@@ amed the we 3@@ 2000 ( we for Western Electric ) , and had two follow @@@ -@@ @ on generations , the we 3@@ 2@@ 100 and we 3@@ 2@@ 200 .
all these systems ran the UNI@@ X System V operating system .
Motor@@ ola 's success with the 6@@ 8@@ 000 led to the MC@@ 6@@ 8@@ 0@@ 10 , which added virtual memory support .
the MC@@ 6@@ 8@@ 0@@ 20 , introduced in 1984 added full 32 @@@ -@@ @ bit data and address buses .
the 6@@ 8@@ 0@@ 20 became hu@@ gely popular in the Uni@@ x super@@ micro@@ computer market , and many small companies ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . , Al@@ tos , Charles River D@@ ata Sy@@ stems , Cro@@ mem@@ co ) produced des@@ k@@ top @@@ -@@ @ size systems .
the continued success led to the MC@@ 6@@ 8@@ 0@@ 40 , which included an F@@ P@@ U for better math performance .
the 6@@ 8@@ k family fa@@ ded from the des@@ k@@ top in the early 1990s .
other large companies designed the 6@@ 8@@ 0@@ 20 and follow @@@ -@@ @ ons into em@@ bed@@ ded equipment .

the MI@@ PS R@@ 2000 ( 1984 ) and R@@ 3@@ 000 ( 1989 ) were highly successful 32 @@@ -@@ @ bit R@@ I@@ SC micro@@ proc@@ es@@ sors .
from 1993 to 2003 , the 32 @@@ -@@ @ bit x@@ 86 architec@@ tures became increasingly dominant in des@@ k@@ top , lap@@ top , and ser@@ ver markets , and these micro@@ proc@@ es@@ sors became faster and more capable .
during this sp@@ an , these proc@@ es@@ sors increased in complex@@ ity ( trans@@ ist@@ or count ) and capability ( instruc@@ tions / second ) by at least three orders of mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de .
the move to 64 bi@@ ts by Pow@@ er@@ PC proc@@ es@@ sors had been intended since the proc@@ es@@ sors ' design in the early 9@@ 0s and was not a major cause of in@@ compati@@ bility .
existing in@@ te@@ ger regist@@ ers are extended as are all related data path@@ ways , but , as was the case with IA @@@ -@@ @ 32 , both flo@@ ating point and v@@ ec@@ tor units had been operating at or above 64 bi@@ ts for several years .
the first commercial R@@ I@@ SC micro@@ proc@@ essor design was released in 1984 by MI@@ PS Com@@ pu@@ ter Sy@@ stems , the 32 @@@ -@@ @ bit R@@ 2000 ( the R@@ 1000 was not released ) .
the R@@ 3@@ 000 made the design truly practical , and the R@@ 4@@ 000 introduced the world 's first commer@@ ci@@ ally available 64 @@@ -@@ @ bit R@@ I@@ SC micro@@ proc@@ essor .
competing projects would result in the IBM power and S@@ un S@@ PA@@ RC architec@@ tures .

unlike high @@@ -@@ @ level languages , there is usually a one @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one correspon@@ dence between simple assembly statements and machine language instruc@@ tions .
in these cases , the most popular one is usually that supplied by the manufacturer and used in its documentation .
most instruc@@ tions refer to a single value , or a pair of values .
thus a mac@@ ro might generate numerous assembly language instruc@@ tions or data defin@@ itions , based on the mac@@ ro arguments .
this could be used to generate record @@@ -@@ @ style data structures or " un@@ rol@@ led " lo@@ ops , for example , or could generate entire al@@ gor@@ ith@@ ms based on complex parame@@ ters .
this was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of G@@ O@@ TO operations in assembly code , one of the main factors causing sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti code in assembly language .
there has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemb@@ lers since the decline of large @@@ -@@ @ scale assembly language development .
many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well , including a large amount of the IBM main@@ frame software written by large corpor@@ ations .
most early micro@@ computers reli@@ ed on hand @@@ -@@ @ co@@ ded assembly language , including most operating systems and large applications .
this was because these systems had severe resource constra@@ ints , imposed idi@@ os@@ yn@@ cratic memory and display architec@@ tures , and provided limited , bu@@ g@@ gy system services .
even into the 1990s , most consol@@ e video games were written in assembly , including most games for the Meg@@ a D@@ ri@@ ve / Gen@@ es@@ is and the Super N@@ inten@@ do Enter@@ tain@@ ment System .
the ar@@ c@@ ade game NBA j@@ am ( 1993 ) is another example .
Assembly language has specific nic@@ he uses where it is important ; see below .
Assembly language is still ta@@ ught in most computer science and electronic engineering program@@ s .
program@@ s using such facilities , such as the Lin@@ u@@ x ker@@ nel , can then construct ab@@ str@@ actions using different assembly language on each hard@@ w@@ are platform .
the system 's por@@ table code can then use these proc@@ essor @@@ -@@ @ specific components through a uni@@ form inter@@ face .
a generation of IBM main@@ frame program@@ mers called it A@@ L@@ C for " Assembly Lan@@ gu@@ age Code " or B@@ al for Bas@@ ic Assembly Lan@@ gu@@ age .
calling the language assemb@@ ler might be considered potentially conf@@ using and ambi@@ gu@@ ous , since this is also the name of the utility program that transla@@ tes assembly language statements into machine code .
however , this usage has been common among professionals and in the literature for decades .
* The comp@@ ut@@ ational step where an assemb@@ ler is run , including all mac@@ ro processing , is termed assembly time .
on Uni@@ x systems , the assemb@@ ler is traditionally called as , although it is not a single body of code , being typically written an@@ ew for each port .
a number of Uni@@ x vari@@ ants use gas .
within proc@@ essor groups , each assemb@@ ler has its own di@@ al@@ ect .
sometimes , some assemb@@ lers can read another assemb@@ ler 's di@@ al@@ ect , for example , TA@@ S@@ M can read old MA@@ S@@ M code , but not the rever@@ se .
the bas@@ ics are all the same , but the advanced features will differ .
also , assembly can sometimes be por@@ table across different operating systems on the same type of C@@ P@@ U .

limiting the number of memory acc@@ esses provided the key to extr@@ acting high performance from a modern computer .
now a system can star@@ ve several proc@@ es@@ sors at the same time , notably because only one proc@@ essor can access the computer 's memory at a time .
of course , not all data ends up con@@ fined to a single task , which means that more than one proc@@ essor may require the same data .
to handle these cases , N@@ U@@ MA systems include additional hard@@ w@@ are or software to move data between memory banks .
the IBM System / 360 ( S / 360 ) was a main@@ frame computer system family announced by IBM on April 7 , 19@@ 64 , and delivered between 19@@ 65 and 197@@ 8 .
many consider the design one of the most successful computers in history , influ@@ encing computer design for years to come .
with other ven@@ d@@ ors ( with the no@@ table exception of IC@@ T ) , customers had to choose between machines they could out@@ grow and machines that were potentially over@@ pow@@ ered ( and thus too expensive ) .
this meant that many companies simply did not buy computers .
the initial announcement in 19@@ 64 included Mo@@ de@@ ls 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 62 , and 70 .
the last three , intended to replace the 7@@ 000 series machines , never shi@@ pped and were replaced by the 65 and 75 , which were first delivered in November 19@@ 65 , and January 19@@ 66 , respectively .
later addi@@ tions to the low @@@ -@@ @ end included models 20 ( 19@@ 66 , mentioned above ) , 22 ( 1971 ) , and 25 ( 19@@ 68 ) .
a succ@@ ession of high @@@ -@@ @ end machines included the Mo@@ del 67 ( 19@@ 66 , mentioned below , brief@@ ly anticipated as the 64 and 66 ) , 85 ( 19@@ 69 ) , 91 ( 1967 , anticipated as the 92 ) , 95 ( 19@@ 68 ) , and 19@@ 5 ( 1971 ) .
the 85 design was inter@@ mediate between the System / 360 line and the follow @@@ -@@ @ on System / 3@@ 70 and was the basis for the 3@@ 70 / 165 .
IBM stopped marketing all System / 360 models by the end of 197@@ 7 .
) La@@ ter compatible IBM systems include the 30@@ 90 , the ES / 9@@ 000 family , 9@@ 6@@ 72 ( System / 3@@ 90 family ) , the z@@ Ser@@ ies , System z@@ 9 , System z@@ 10 and IBM z@@ Enter@@ prise System .

instruc@@ tions per second ( I@@ PS ) is a measure of a computer 's proc@@ essor speed .
in the late 197@@ 0s , min@@ ic@@ om@@ pu@@ ter performance was compared using " V@@ A@@ X MI@@ PS , " where computers were meas@@ ured on a task and their performance rated against the V@@ A@@ X 11 / 7@@ 80 that was mar@@ ke@@ ted as a " 1 MI@@ PS " machine .
( the measure was also known as the " V@@ A@@ X Unit of Per@@ for@@ man@@ ce " or V@@ U@@ P .
" z@@ MI@@ PS " ref@@ ers to the MI@@ PS measure used intern@@ ally by IBM to rate its main@@ frame ser@@ vers ( z@@ Ser@@ ies , IBM System z@@ 9 , and IBM System z@@ 10 ) .
very low @@@ -@@ @ cost systems , such as some early home computers , would instead use the C@@ P@@ U to send the data through an output pin , using the bit @@@ -@@ @ ban@@ ging techni@@ que .
= = = hard@@ w@@ are ab@@ str@@ action = = = Oper@@ ating systems usually use a symbolic name to refer to the ser@@ ial ports of a computer .
the Microsoft MS @@@ -@@ @ DOS and Windows environ@@ ments refer to ser@@ ial ports as C@@ om ports : C@@ OM@@ 1 , C@@ OM@@ 2 .. et@@ c .
this list includes some of the more common devices that are connected to the ser@@ ial port on a PC .
= = = Spe@@ ed = = = ser@@ ial ports use two @@@ -@@ @ level ( bin@@ ary ) sign@@ aling , so the data rate in bi@@ ts per second is equal to the symbol rate in b@@ au@@ ds .
for example with 8 @@@ -@@ @ N @@@ -@@ @ 1 character f@@ ram@@ ing only 80 % of the bi@@ ts are available for data ( for every eight bi@@ ts of data , two more f@@ ram@@ ing bi@@ ts are sent ) .
bit rates com@@ mon@@ ly supported include 75 , 110 , 300 , 1@@ 200 , 2@@ 400 , 4@@ 800 , 9@@ 600 , 19@@ 200 , 3@@ 8@@ 400 , 5@@ 7@@ 600 and 1@@ 15@@ 200 bit / s .
cr@@ y@@ st@@ al os@@ cil@@ la@@ tors with a frequ@@ ency of 1.@@ 8@@ 4@@ 3@@ 200 M@@ H@@ z are sold specifically for this purpose .
this is 16 times the fas@@ test bit rate and the ser@@ ial port cir@@ cu@@ it can easily divide this down to lower frequ@@ encies as required .
most ser@@ ial communications design@@ s send the data bi@@ ts within each By@@ te L@@ S@@ B ( Le@@ ast significant bit ) first .
the par@@ ity bit in each character can be set to none ( N ) , od@@ d ( O ) , even ( E ) , mark ( M ) , or space ( S ) .
mark par@@ ity means that the par@@ ity bit is always set to the mark signal condition ( logical 1 ) and likewise space par@@ ity always sends the par@@ ity bit in the space signal condition .
electronic devices usually use one stop bit .
= = = Con@@ ven@@ tional no@@ tation = = = The D / P / S ( D@@ ata / Par@@ ity / S@@ top ) conventional no@@ tation speci@@ fies the f@@ ram@@ ing of a ser@@ ial connection .
the most common usage on micro@@ computers is 8 / N / 1 ( 8@@ N1 ) .
this speci@@ fies 8 data bi@@ ts , no par@@ ity , 1 stop bit .
7 / E / 1 ( 7@@ E@@ 1 ) means that an even par@@ ity bit is added to the seven data bi@@ ts for a total of eight bi@@ ts between the start and stop bi@@ ts .
common hard@@ w@@ are hand@@ shake signals ( hard@@ w@@ are flow control ) use the RS @@@ -@@ @ 2@@ 32 RTS / C@@ T@@ S or D@@ T@@ R / DS@@ R signal cir@@ cu@@ its .
another method of flow control ( software flow control ) uses special charac@@ ters such as X@@ O@@ N / X@@ O@@ FF to control the flow of data .
the X@@ O@@ N / X@@ O@@ FF charac@@ ters are sent by the recei@@ ver to the sen@@ der to control when the sen@@ der will send data , that is , these charac@@ ters go in the opposite direction to the data being sent .
on the other hand , since no extra signal cir@@ cu@@ its are required , X@@ O@@ N / X@@ O@@ FF flow control can be done on a 3 w@@ ire inter@@ face .
additionally they allow controlling the data flow , em@@ ulating all signal lines ( D@@ T@@ R / DS@@ R / C@@ T@@ S / RTS / D@@ CD / RI ) and custom@@ iz@@ ing pin@@ out .
for instance , virtual ser@@ ial ports can share data between several applications from one G@@ PS device connected to a ser@@ ial port .
another option is to communicate with any other ser@@ ial devices via internet or L@@ AN as if they are loc@@ ally connected to computer ( ser@@ ial over L@@ AN / ser@@ ial @@@ -@@ @ over @@@ -@@ @ E@@ ther@@ net technology ) .
P@@ C@@ I Express is a lay@@ ered protocol , consisting of a " trans@@ action lay@@ er , " a " data link lay@@ er , " and a " physical lay@@ er . "
the P@@ hy@@ sical L@@ ay@@ er is sub@@ divided into logical and electrical sub@@ lay@@ ers .
devices may op@@ tionally support wider links composed of 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , or 32 lan@@ es .
= = = = D@@ ata transmission = = = = P@@ C@@ I@@ e sends all control messages , including inter@@ rup@@ ts , over the same links used for data .
in this co@@ ding scheme every eight ( un@@ co@@ ded ) pay@@ load bi@@ ts of data are replaced with 10 ( en@@ co@@ ded ) bi@@ ts of trans@@ mit data , causing a 20 % over@@ head in the electrical b@@ and@@ w@@ id@@ th .
many other protocols ( such as SO@@ N@@ ET ) use a different form of en@@ co@@ ding known as " s@@ cr@@ amb@@ ling " to em@@ bed clock information into data stre@@ ams .
P@@ C@@ I Express uses credit @@@ -@@ @ based flow control .
the advantage of this scheme ( compared to other methods such as wait states or hand@@ shake @@@ -@@ @ based transfer protocols ) is that the la@@ ten@@ cy of credit return does not affect performance , provided that the credit limit is not en@@ countered .
P@@ C@@ I@@ e 1.@@ x is often quoted to support a data rate of 250 M@@ B / s in each direction , per lan@@ e .
this figure is a calc@@ ulation from the physical sign@@ aling rate ( 2.5 gi@@ g@@ ab@@ au@@ d ) divided by the en@@ co@@ ding over@@ head ( 10 bi@@ ts per By@@ te .
) This means a six@@ teen lan@@ e ( × 16 ) P@@ C@@ I@@ e card would then be the@@ ore@@ tically capable of 16 × 250 M@@ B / s = 4 G@@ B / s in each direction .
like other high data rate ser@@ ial inter@@ connect systems , P@@ C@@ I@@ e has a protocol and processing over@@ head due to the additional transfer ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness ( C@@ RC and acknowled@@ gements ) .
long continuous uni@@ direc@@ tional trans@@ fers ( such as those typical in high @@@ -@@ @ performance storage control@@ lers ) can approach > 95 % of P@@ C@@ I@@ e 's raw ( lan@@ e ) data rate .
) But in more typical applications ( such as a US@@ B or E@@ ther@@ net control@@ ler ) , the traffic profile is character@@ ized as short data p@@ ac@@ kets with frequent enforced acknowled@@ gements .
these include In@@ fin@@ i@@ B@@ and , Rap@@ id@@ I@@ O , Hy@@ per@@ Transport , Q@@ PI , Star@@ Fabri@@ c , and MI@@ PI L@@ L@@ I .
an example of such a tra@@ de@@ off is adding complex he@@ ader information to a trans@@ mitted p@@ ac@@ ket to allow for complex rout@@ ing ( P@@ C@@ I Express is not capable of this ) .
also making the system hot @@@ -@@ @ p@@ lugg@@ able requires that software track network top@@ ology changes .
examples of buses su@@ ited for this purpose are In@@ fin@@ i@@ B@@ and and Star@@ Fabri@@ c .
examples of bus protocols designed for this purpose are Rap@@ id@@ I@@ O and Hy@@ per@@ Transport .
P@@ C@@ I Express falls somewhere in the middle , targeted by design as a system inter@@ connect ( local bus ) rather than a device inter@@ connect or ro@@ uted network protocol .

Her@@ mann W@@ ey@@ l introduced the term " Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a " ( after S@@ oph@@ us Li@@ e ) in the 19@@ 30@@ s .
for example , the Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a of S@@ U ( " n " ) is written as formula _ 13 .
a sub@@ space formula _ 18 that is closed under the Li@@ e brac@@ ket is called a Li@@ e sub@@ al@@ ge@@ br@@ a .
the central@@ iz@@ er of formula _ 5 itself is called the cen@@ ter of formula _ 5 .
below .
any one @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a over a field is ab@@ el@@ ian , by the anti@@ sym@@ me@@ try of the Li@@ e brac@@ ket .
as a concrete example , consider the special lin@@ e@@ ar group S@@ L ( " n , " R ) , consisting of all " n " × " n " mat@@ ri@@ ces with real ent@@ ries and determin@@ ant 1 .
this is a mat@@ ri@@ x Li@@ e group , and its Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a consists of all " n " × " n " mat@@ ri@@ ces with real ent@@ ries and tr@@ ace 0 .
in particular , this has an application to the clas@@ si@@ fication of Li@@ e groups .
more generally still , a Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a formula _ 5 is said to be sol@@ v@@ able if the der@@ ived series : : formula _ 8@@ 7@@ becomes zero eventually .
every fin@@ ite @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a has a unique maxim@@ al sol@@ v@@ able ideal , called its radical .
= = = C@@ artan 's criter@@ ion = = = C@@ artan 's criter@@ ion gives conditions for a Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a to be n@@ il@@ po@@ tent , sol@@ v@@ able , or sem@@ is@@ imp@@ le .
a Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a formula _ 5 is sem@@ is@@ imp@@ le if and only if the killing form is non@@ de@@ generate .
furthermore , sem@@ is@@ imp@@ le Li@@ e al@@ ge@@ bra@@ s over an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ ically closed field have been completely classified through their root systems .
this Li@@ e group is not determined uni@@ qu@@ ely ; however , any two connected Li@@ e groups with the same Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a are " loc@@ ally is@@ om@@ or@@ p@@ hic , " and in particular , have the same universal cover .
however , when the Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a formula _ 5 is fin@@ ite @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional , one can associate to it a simply connected Li@@ e group having formula _ 5 as its Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a .
more precisely , the Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a func@@ tor L has a left ad@@ joint func@@ tor Γ from fin@@ ite @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional ( real ) Li@@ e al@@ ge@@ bra@@ s to Li@@ e groups , fac@@ tor@@ ing through the full sub@@ category of simply connected Li@@ e groups .
the universal cover group above can be constructed as the image of the Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a under the ex@@ pon@@ ential map .
more generally , we have that the Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a is home@@ om@@ or@@ p@@ hic to a neigh@@ bor@@ hood of the identity .
but g@@ lob@@ ally , if the Li@@ e group is comp@@ act , the ex@@ pon@@ ential will not be in@@ j@@ ec@@ tive , and if the Li@@ e group is not connected , simply connected or comp@@ act , the ex@@ pon@@ ential map need not be sur@@ j@@ ec@@ tive .
if the Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a is in@@ fin@@ ite @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional , the issue is more sub@@ tle .
in many in@@ stances , the ex@@ pon@@ ential map is not even loc@@ ally a home@@ om@@ or@@ ph@@ ism ( for example , in D@@ if@@ f ( S@@ 1 ) , one may find di@@ ffe@@ om@@ or@@ ph@@ isms arbitr@@ arily close to the identity that are not in the image of ex@@ p ) .
furthermore , some in@@ fin@@ ite @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional Li@@ e al@@ ge@@ bra@@ s are not the Li@@ e Al@@ ge@@ br@@ a of any group .

population gen@@ e@@ tics was a vital ing@@ redi@@ ent in the emer@@ gence of the modern evol@@ utionary syn@@ th@@ es@@ is .
B@@ . S. Hal@@ dan@@ e and R@@ . A. Fis@@ her , who also laid the foundations for the related discipline of quanti@@ t@@ ative gen@@ e@@ tics .
for example , all of the mo@@ ths of the same species living in an isolated forest are a population .
a gen@@ e in this population may have several alter@@ nate forms , which account for vari@@ ations between the ph@@ en@@ oty@@ pes of the organis@@ ms .
an example might be a gen@@ e for col@@ oration in mo@@ ths that has two alle@@ les : Black and white .
gen@@ etic dri@@ ft may cause gen@@ e vari@@ ants to dis@@ appear completely , and there@@ by reduce gen@@ etic vari@@ ability .
Ron@@ ald Fis@@ her held the view that gen@@ etic dri@@ ft plays at the most a minor role in evol@@ ution , and this remained the dominant view for several decades .
in 19@@ 68 Mo@@ too Kim@@ ura rek@@ in@@ d@@ led the debate with his neutral theory of mo@@ lec@@ ular evol@@ ution which claims that most of the changes in the gen@@ etic material are caused by neutral mut@@ ations and gen@@ etic dri@@ ft .
Mut@@ ations can involve large sections of DNA becoming du@@ p@@ lic@@ ated , usually through gen@@ etic re@@ combination .
these du@@ p@@ lic@@ ations are a major source of raw material for evol@@ ving new gen@@ es , with tens to hundreds of gen@@ es du@@ p@@ lic@@ ated in animal gen@@ omes every million years .
for example , the human eye uses four gen@@ es to make structures that sense light : three for col@@ or vision and one for night vision ; all four ar@@ ose from a single an@@ ces@@ tral gen@@ e .
= = = Gen@@ e flow and transfer = = = Gen@@ e flow is the exchange of gen@@ es between populations , which are usually of the same species .
examples of gen@@ e flow within a species include the migration and then bre@@ eding of organis@@ ms , or the exchange of pol@@ len .
Gen@@ e transfer between species includes the formation of hy@@ bri@@ d organis@@ ms and hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal gen@@ e transfer .
immigration may add new gen@@ etic material to the established gen@@ e pool of a population .
Gen@@ e flow is hin@@ dered by mountain ran@@ ges , O@@ ce@@ ans and de@@ ser@@ ts or even man @@@ -@@ @ made structures such as the Great Wall of China , which has hin@@ dered the flow of plant gen@@ es .
Pol@@ y@@ plo@@ id@@ y is important in hy@@ bri@@ ds as it allows re@@ production , with the two different sets of ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes each being able to pair with an i@@ den@@ tical partner during me@@ i@@ osis .
= = = = Hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal Gen@@ e Trans@@ fer = = = = " Hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal gen@@ e transfer " is the transfer of gen@@ etic material from one organ@@ ism to another organ@@ ism that is not its off@@ spring ; this is most common among bac@@ ter@@ ia .
Hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal transfer of gen@@ es from bac@@ ter@@ ia to eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes such as the ye@@ ast " S@@ ac@@ char@@ om@@ y@@ ces cer@@ ev@@ is@@ i@@ a@@ e " and the ad@@ z@@ uki be@@ an be@@ etle " Cal@@ los@@ ob@@ ru@@ ch@@ us ch@@ in@@ en@@ sis " may also have occurred .
vir@@ uses can also carry DNA between organis@@ ms , allowing transfer of gen@@ es even across biological dom@@ ain@@ s .
in reality , one alle@@ le is frequently found in lin@@ k@@ age dis@@ equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um with gen@@ es at other Lo@@ ci , especially with gen@@ es located nearby on the same ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome .
in the extreme case of primarily as@@ ex@@ ual populations , lin@@ k@@ age is complete , and different population gen@@ etic equ@@ ations can be der@@ ived and solved , which be@@ have quite differ@@ ently from the sexual case .
population gen@@ e@@ tics of micro@@ organis@@ ms is also an essential factor for dev@@ ising strategies for the conserv@@ ation and better u@@ tili@@ z@@ ation of beneficial mic@@ rob@@ es ( X@@ u , 2010 ) .
a key step was the work of the British bi@@ ologist and statisti@@ cian R@@ .@@ A. Fis@@ her .
in a series of papers beginning in 19@@ 24 , another British gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ist , J@@ .@@ B@@ .S.
the work of Fis@@ her , Hal@@ dan@@ e and W@@ right founded the discipline of " population gen@@ e@@ tics . "
the American George R@@ . Pri@@ ce worked with both Ham@@ il@@ ton and M@@ ayn@@ ard S@@ mit@@ h .
American Richard Le@@ won@@ tin and Japanese Mo@@ too Kim@@ ura were heavily influenced by W@@ right .
Theod@@ os@@ i@@ us Dob@@ z@@ h@@ ans@@ ky , a post@@ doc@@ toral worker in T@@ . H@@ . M@@ organ 's lab , had been influenced by the work on gen@@ etic diversity by Russian gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ists such as Sergei Ch@@ et@@ ver@@ ikov .
Dob@@ z@@ h@@ ans@@ ky examined the gen@@ etic diversity of wild populations and showed that , contrary to the ass@@ ump@@ tions of the population gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ists , these populations had large amounts of gen@@ etic diversity , with marked differences between sub @@@ -@@ @ populations .
the book also took the highly ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal work of the population gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ists and put it into a more acces@@ sible form .

Ray@@ le@@ igh sc@@ at@@ tering of sun@@ light in the atmosphere causes di@@ ff@@ use sky radi@@ ation , which is the reason for the blue col@@ or of the sky and the yel@@ low tone of the sun itself .
S@@ cat@@ tering by parti@@ c@@ les similar to , or larger than , the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of light is typically treated by the Mi@@ e theory , the discre@@ te di@@ pol@@ e approxim@@ ation and other comp@@ ut@@ ational techniques .
for example , the major constituent of the atmosphere , nit@@ ro@@ gen , has a Ray@@ le@@ igh cross section of at a w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of 5@@ 32 N@@ M ( green light ) .
the strong w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th dependence of the sc@@ at@@ tering ( ~ " λ " − 4 ) means that shorter ( blue ) w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ ths are sc@@ at@@ tered more strongly than longer ( red ) w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ ths .
this results in the indirect blue light coming from all regions of the sky .
as previously stated , Ray@@ le@@ igh sc@@ at@@ tering is in@@ ver@@ sely propor@@ tional to the fourth power of w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th , so that shorter w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th Vi@@ o@@ let and blue light will sc@@ at@@ ter more than the longer w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ ths ( yel@@ low and especially red light ) .
the resulting col@@ or , which appears like a p@@ ale blue , actually is a mi@@ x@@ ture of all the sc@@ at@@ tered col@@ ors , mainly blue and green .
viewed from space , however , the sky is black and the sun is white .
in locations with little light pollution , the mo@@ on@@ lit night sky is also blue , because mo@@ on@@ light is reflected sun@@ light , with a slightly lower col@@ or temper@@ ature due to the bro@@ w@@ nish col@@ or of the moon .

most scholars reject the idea that " Ham@@ let " is in any way connected with S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are 's only son , Ham@@ net S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are , who died in 15@@ 96 at age eleven .
conventional wis@@ dom holds that " Ham@@ let " is too obviously connected to legend , and the name Ham@@ net was quite popular at the time .
he notes that the name of Ham@@ net Sad@@ ler , the Str@@ at@@ ford neighbour after whom Ham@@ net was named , was often written as Ham@@ let Sad@@ ler and that , in the loose or@@ tho@@ graphy of the time , the names were virtually inter@@ chan@@ ge@@ able .

this view changed dras@@ tically in the 18th century , when critics regarded Ham@@ let as a her@@ o - a p@@ ure , br@@ illi@@ ant young man th@@ rust into unfortun@@ ate circumstances .
by the mid @@@ -@@ @ 18th century , however , the adv@@ ent of Go@@ th@@ ic literature brought psychological and my@@ sti@@ cal read@@ ings , returning mad@@ ness and the gh@@ ost to the fo@@ ref@@ ront .
these developments represented a fundamental change in literary criticism , which came to focus more on character and less on plot .
by the 19th century , Roman@@ tic critics valued " Ham@@ let " for its internal , individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and in@@ ner character in general .

these discre@@ te values are called energy levels .
if the potential energy is set to zero at in@@ fin@@ ite distance from the at@@ om@@ ic n@@ uc@@ le@@ us or mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e , the usual convention , then bound elec@@ tr@@ on states have negative potential energy .
if an atom , Ion , or mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e is at the lowest possible energy level , it and its elec@@ tr@@ ons are said to be in the " ground state . "
if more than one qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ical state is at the same energy , the energy levels are " de@@ generate . "

the energy of its state is mainly determined by the elec@@ tro@@ st@@ atic inter@@ action of the ( negative ) elec@@ tr@@ on with the ( positive ) n@@ uc@@ le@@ us .
= = = = Mul@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ elec@@ tr@@ on At@@ oms include elec@@ tro@@ st@@ atic inter@@ action of an elec@@ tr@@ on with other elec@@ tr@@ ons = = = = If there is more than one elec@@ tr@@ on around the atom , elec@@ tr@@ on @@@ -@@ @ elec@@ tr@@ on @@@ -@@ @ inter@@ actions raise the energy level .
these inter@@ actions are often neglec@@ ted if the sp@@ ati@@ al over@@ la@@ p of the elec@@ tr@@ on w@@ av@@ ef@@ un@@ c@@ tions is low .
for multi @@@ -@@ @ elec@@ tr@@ on At@@ oms , inter@@ actions between elec@@ tr@@ ons cause the prec@@ eding equ@@ ation to be no longer accur@@ ate as stated simply with as the at@@ om@@ ic number .
: formula _ 3@@ In such cases , the or@@ bi@@ tal types ( determined by the az@@ im@@ u@@ thal qu@@ ant@@ um number ) as well as their levels within the mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e affect and therefore also affect the various at@@ om@@ ic elec@@ tr@@ on energy levels .
the Au@@ f@@ ba@@ u principle of filling an atom with elec@@ tr@@ ons for an elec@@ tr@@ on config@@ ur@@ ation takes these differing energy levels into account .
for filling an atom with elec@@ tr@@ ons in the ground state , the lowest energy levels are filled first and consistent with the Pa@@ uli exclu@@ sion principle , the Au@@ f@@ ba@@ u principle , and H@@ und 's rule .
the inter@@ action energy therefore becomes : formula _ 8 .
the energy level of the bon@@ ding or@@ bit@@ als is lower , and the energy level of the anti@@ bon@@ ding or@@ bit@@ als is higher .
a non @@@ -@@ @ bon@@ ding or@@ bi@@ tal in a mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e is an or@@ bi@@ tal with elec@@ tr@@ ons in ou@@ ter shel@@ ls which do not participate in bon@@ ding and its energy level is the same as that of the constituent atom .
the specific ener@@ gies of these components v@@ ary with the specific energy state and the sub@@ stance .
in mo@@ lec@@ ular physi@@ cs and qu@@ ant@@ um chem@@ istry , an energy level is a quanti@@ z@@ ed energy of a bound qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ical state .
= = = Energy level di@@ ag@@ r@@ ams = = = There are various types of energy level di@@ ag@@ r@@ ams for bonds between At@@ oms in a mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e .
elec@@ tr@@ ons can also be completely removed from a chemical species such as an atom , mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e , or Ion .
if an atom , Ion , or mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e is at the lowest possible energy level , it and its elec@@ tr@@ ons are said to be in the " ground state . "
such a species can be ex@@ cited to a higher energy level by absor@@ bing a pho@@ ton whose energy is equal to the energy difference between the levels .
a pho@@ ton 's energy is equal to Plan@@ ck 's constant ( ) times its frequ@@ ency ( ) and thus is propor@@ tional to its frequ@@ ency , or in@@ ver@@ sely to its w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th ( ) .
Con@@ du@@ ction of heat typically occur@@ s as mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les or At@@ oms col@@ li@@ de transferring the heat between each other .
a subsequent drop of an elec@@ tr@@ on to a lower energy level can release a pho@@ ton , causing a possibly c@@ olo@@ red g@@ low .
an elec@@ tr@@ on far@@ ther from the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us has higher potential energy than an elec@@ tr@@ on closer to the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us , thus it becomes less bound to the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us , since its potential energy is negative and in@@ ver@@ sely dependent on its distance from the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us .
at first this appears to be an exception to the requirement for energy levels .

the members of this group are usually in@@ ert to most common chemical reactions ( for example , comb@@ us@@ tion ) because the ou@@ ter val@@ ence shel@@ l is completely filled with eight elec@@ tr@@ ons .

this is a result of the same sp@@ in @@@ -@@ @ or@@ bit inter@@ actions that make un@@ un@@ oc@@ ti@@ um un@@ usually reac@@ tive .
for example , it was shown that the reaction of un@@ un@@ oc@@ ti@@ um with to form the compo@@ und would release an energy of 1@@ 06 k@@ cal / MOL of which about 46 k@@ cal / MOL come from these inter@@ actions .

A@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics is a sub @@@ -@@ @ field of f@@ lu@@ id dynam@@ ics and gas dynam@@ ics , and many aspects of a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics theory are common to these fields .
formal a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics study in the modern sense began in the eigh@@ teen@@ th century , although ob@@ serv@@ ations of fundamental concep@@ ts such as a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic dra@@ g have been recorded much earlier .
the N@@ avier @@@ -@@ @ Sto@@ kes equ@@ ations are the most general governing equ@@ ations of f@@ lu@@ id flow and are difficult to solve .
building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel , the W@@ right brothers fle@@ w the first pow@@ ered aircraft on December 17 , 19@@ 03 .
during the time of the first flights , Fre@@ der@@ ick W. Lan@@ ches@@ ter , Martin Wil@@ helm Kut@@ ta , and Nikola@@ i Z@@ huk@@ ov@@ sky independently created the@@ ories that connected circulation of a f@@ lu@@ id flow to lift .
Kut@@ ta and Z@@ huk@@ ov@@ sky went on to develop a two @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional wing theory .
as aircraft speed increased , design@@ ers began to en@@ counter challenges associated with air com@@ pres@@ sibility at spe@@ eds near or greater than the speed of sound .
the differences in air flows under these conditions led to problems in aircraft control , increased dra@@ g due to shock waves , and structural dangers due to a@@ ero@@ el@@ as@@ tic fl@@ ut@@ ter .
the rati@@ o of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mac@@ h number after Ern@@ st Mac@@ h , who was one of the first to investigate the properties of su@@ person@@ ic flow .
in many a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics problems , the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight : lift , dra@@ g , th@@ rust , and weight .
of these , lift and dra@@ g are a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic forces , i@@ .@@ e@@ .
S@@ ub@@ son@@ ic flows are flow fields in which air v@@ el@@ o@@ city throughout the entire flow is below the local speed of sound .
Tran@@ son@@ ic flows include both regions of sub@@ son@@ ic flow and regions in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound .
Su@@ person@@ ic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere .
a fourth clas@@ si@@ fication , hy@@ person@@ ic flow , ref@@ ers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound .
Vis@@ cos@@ ity is associated with the fri@@ c@@ tional forces in a flow .
in some flow fields , vis@@ c@@ ous effects are very small , and solutions may neglec@@ t to account for vis@@ c@@ ous effects .
finally , a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic problems may also be classified by the flow environment .
on a mo@@ lec@@ ular level , flow fields are made up of many individual col@@ lis@@ ions between gas mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les and between gas mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les and solid sur@@ faces .
this ass@@ umption allows f@@ lu@@ id properties such as den@@ s@@ ity and flow v@@ el@@ o@@ city to be defined anywhere within the flow .
for example , many a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmos@@ ph@@ er@@ ic conditions , where the mean free path length is on the order of micro@@ meters .
in its most complete form , the momentum conserv@@ ation equ@@ ations are known as the N@@ avier @@@ -@@ @ Sto@@ kes equ@@ ations .
the N@@ avier @@@ -@@ @ Sto@@ kes equ@@ ations have no known analy@@ tical solution , and are solved in modern a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics using comp@@ ut@@ ational techniques .
because of the comp@@ ut@@ ational cost of solving these complex equ@@ ations , simp@@ lified expres@@ sions of momentum conserv@@ ation may be appropriate to specific applications .
= = branches of a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics = = A@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow , including flow speed , com@@ pres@@ sibility , and vis@@ cos@@ ity .
evalu@@ ating the lift and dra@@ g on an air@@ plane or the shock waves that form in front of the n@@ ose of a rocket are examples of external a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics .
for instance , internal a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es the study of the air@@ flow through a j@@ et engine or through an air condi@@ tioning pip@@ e .
A@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic problems can also be classified according to whether the flow speed is below , near or above the speed of sound .
A@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic@@ ists disagree over the precise defin@@ ition of hy@@ person@@ ic flow ; a roug@@ h defin@@ ition considers flows with Mac@@ h numbers above 5 to be hy@@ person@@ ic .
the approxim@@ ations to these problems are called in@@ vis@@ ci@@ d flows .
= = = In@@ com@@ pres@@ sible a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics = = = A@@ n in@@ com@@ pres@@ sible flow is a flow in which den@@ s@@ ity is constant in both time and space .
= = = = S@@ ub@@ son@@ ic flow = = = = S@@ ub@@ son@@ ic ( or low @@@ -@@ @ speed ) a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics studies f@@ lu@@ id motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow .
there are several branches of sub@@ son@@ ic flow but one special case ar@@ ises when the flow is in@@ vis@@ ci@@ d , in@@ com@@ pres@@ sible and ir@@ rot@@ ational .
this case is called potential flow and allows the differ@@ ential equ@@ ations used to be a simp@@ lified version of the governing equ@@ ations of f@@ lu@@ id dynam@@ ics , thus making available to the a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic@@ ist a range of quick and easy solutions .
in general , this is the case where the Mac@@ h number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.@@ 3 .
= = = = Tran@@ son@@ ic flow = = = = The term Tran@@ son@@ ic ref@@ ers to a range of flow v@@ el@@ oc@@ ities just below and above the local speed of sound ( generally taken as Mac@@ h 0.@@ 8 @@@ -@@ @ 1.2 ) .
between these spe@@ eds , some of the air@@ flow is su@@ person@@ ic , and some is not .
= = = = Su@@ person@@ ic flow = = = = Su@@ person@@ ic a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic problems are those involving flow spe@@ eds greater than the speed of sound .
calc@@ ulating the lift on the Con@@ cor@@ de during cruise can be an example of a su@@ person@@ ic a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic problem .
Hy@@ person@@ ic flow is character@@ ized by high temper@@ ature flow behind a shock wave , vis@@ c@@ ous inter@@ action , and chemical dis@@ sociation of gas .
this principle makes a@@ er@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics much more tr@@ ac@@ table ma@@ them@@ atically .
this includes low momentum di@@ ff@@ usion , high momentum conv@@ ection , and rapid vari@@ ation of pressure and flow v@@ el@@ o@@ city in space and time .
flow that is not turbul@@ ent is called la@@ min@@ ar flow .

on June 30 , 1971 , a pro@@ ton be@@ am was gui@@ ded for the first time through the entire National acceler@@ ator Lab@@ or@@ atory acceler@@ ator system including the M@@ ain R@@ ing .
a series of milest@@ ones saw acceler@@ ation rise to 20 Ge@@ V on January 22 , 197@@ 2 to 53 Ge@@ V on February 4 and to 100 Ge@@ V on February 11 .
on March 1 , 197@@ 2 , the then NA@@ L acceler@@ ator system accelerated for the first time a be@@ am of pro@@ t@@ ons to its design energy of 200 Ge@@ V .
on 14 May 197@@ 6 Fer@@ mil@@ a@@ b took its pro@@ t@@ ons all the way to 500 Ge@@ V .

in physi@@ cs , particularly elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism , the Lor@@ ent@@ z force is the combination of electric and mag@@ ne@@ tic force on a point charge due to elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic fields .
the first der@@ iv@@ ation of the Lor@@ ent@@ z force is com@@ mon@@ ly attributed to Oliver He@@ avis@@ ide in 18@@ 89 , although other historians suggest an earlier origin in an 18@@ 65 paper by James cler@@ k Max@@ well .
H@@ end@@ rik Lor@@ ent@@ z der@@ ived it a few years after He@@ avis@@ ide .
more exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly stated : : formula _ 2@@ in which R is the position v@@ ec@@ tor of the charged parti@@ cle , " t " is time , and the over@@ do@@ t is a time der@@ iv@@ ative .
according to some defin@@ itions , the term " Lor@@ ent@@ z force " ref@@ ers specifically to the formula for the mag@@ ne@@ tic force , with the " total " elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force ( including the electric force ) given some other ( non@@ standard ) name .
the mag@@ ne@@ tic force component of the Lor@@ ent@@ z force manif@@ ests itself as the force that acts on a current @@@ -@@ @ carrying w@@ ire in a mag@@ ne@@ tic field .
however , in both cases the experim@@ ental proof was neither complete nor conclu@@ sive .
in all these descri@@ p@@ tions , the force was always given in terms of the properties of the objects involved and the dist@@ ances between them rather than in terms of electric and mag@@ ne@@ tic fields .
J@@ . J@@ . Thom@@ son was the first to attempt to der@@ ive from Max@@ well 's field equ@@ ations the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic forces on a moving charged object in terms of the object 's properties and external fields .
finally , in 18@@ 92 , H@@ end@@ rik Lor@@ ent@@ z der@@ ived the modern form of the formula for the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force which includes the contributions to the total force from both the electric and the mag@@ ne@@ tic fields .
thus , Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations do not stand separate from other physical laws , but are coup@@ led to them via the charge and current den@@ si@@ ties .
the response of a point charge to the Lor@@ ent@@ z law is one aspect ; the generation of E and B by curren@@ ts and charges is another .
in real materials the Lor@@ ent@@ z force is inadequate to describe the behavi@@ or of charged parti@@ c@@ les , both in principle and as a matter of comp@@ ut@@ ation .
the charged parti@@ c@@ les in a material medium both respond to the E and B fields and generate these fields .
see for example , Green @@@ -@@ @ K@@ ub@@ o relations and Green 's function ( many @@@ -@@ @ body theory ) .
= = Lor@@ ent@@ z force law as the defin@@ ition of E and B = = In many text@@ book treat@@ ments of classical elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism , the Lor@@ ent@@ z force Law is used as the " defin@@ ition " of the electric and mag@@ ne@@ tic fields E and B@@ .
so the two v@@ ec@@ tor fields E and B are there@@ by defined throughout space and time , and these are called the " electric field " and " mag@@ ne@@ tic field . "
see for example Bre@@ m@@ s@@ stra@@ h@@ lun@@ g and syn@@ ch@@ ro@@ tr@@ on light .
these effects occur through both a direct effect ( called the radi@@ ation reaction force ) and indirectly ( by affecting the motion of nearby charges and curren@@ ts ) .
when a conduc@@ tor is moved through a mag@@ ne@@ tic field , the mag@@ ne@@ tic force tries to push elec@@ tr@@ ons through the w@@ ire , and this creates the E@@ M@@ F .
in other electrical gener@@ ators , the mag@@ n@@ ets move , while the conduc@@ tors do not .
both of these E@@ M@@ F 's , despite their different orig@@ ins , can be described by the same equ@@ ation , name@@ ly , the E@@ M@@ F is the rate of change of mag@@ ne@@ tic f@@ lu@@ x through the w@@ ire .
) E@@ in@@ stein 's special theory of rela@@ tivity was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects .
the " sign " of the E@@ M@@ F is determined by Len@@ z 's law .
the rever@@ se is also true , the Lor@@ ent@@ z force and the Max@@ well E@@ qu@@ ations can be used to der@@ ive the Far@@ aday Law .
let Σ ( " t " ) be the moving w@@ ire , moving together without ro@@ tation and with constant v@@ el@@ o@@ city V and Σ ( " t " ) be the internal sur@@ face of the w@@ ire .
so we have , the Max@@ well Far@@ aday equ@@ ation : : formula _ 17@@ The two are equivalent if the w@@ ire is not moving .
using Lag@@ range 's equ@@ ations , the equ@@ ation for the Lor@@ ent@@ z force can be obtained .

the SI unit of capac@@ it@@ ance is the far@@ ad ( symbol : F ) , named after the English physi@@ cist Michael Far@@ aday .
a 1 far@@ ad capac@@ it@@ or , when charged with 1 co@@ ul@@ om@@ b of electrical charge , has a potential difference of 1 vol@@ t between its plates .
histor@@ ically , a far@@ ad was regarded as an in@@ conven@@ i@@ ently large unit , both electri@@ cally and physi@@ cally .
such capac@@ itors are princip@@ ally used for energy storage replacing more traditional bat@@ ter@@ ies .
the energy ( meas@@ ured in j@@ ou@@ les ) stored in a capac@@ it@@ or is equal to the " work " done to charge it .
the energy stored in a capac@@ it@@ or is found by integr@@ ating this equ@@ ation .
the most common su@@ bun@@ its of capac@@ it@@ ance in use today are the micro@@ far@@ ad ( µ@@ F ) , n@@ an@@ of@@ ar@@ ad ( n@@ F ) , pic@@ of@@ ar@@ ad ( p@@ F ) , and , in mic@@ roc@@ ir@@ cu@@ its , fem@@ to@@ far@@ ad ( f@@ F ) .
however , spec@@ ially made super@@ capac@@ itors can be much larger ( as much as hundreds of far@@ ads ) , and paras@@ iti@@ c capac@@ itive elements can be less than a fem@@ to@@ far@@ ad .
the closer the she@@ ets are to each other , the greater the capac@@ it@@ ance .
in C@@ G@@ S units the equ@@ ation has the form : : formula _ 6@@ where " C " in this case has the units of length .
see , for example , lin@@ e@@ ar response function .
the integral extends over the entire past history up to the present time .
these res@@ on@@ ances are the basis for a number of experim@@ ental techniques for detec@@ ting def@@ ects .
the defin@@ ition C = Q / V still holds for a single pla@@ te given a charge , in which case the field lines produced by that charge termin@@ ate as if the pla@@ te were at the cen@@ ter of an oppos@@ itely charged sp@@ here at in@@ fin@@ ity .
Her@@ mann von Hel@@ m@@ hol@@ tz and S@@ ir William Thom@@ son showed that the co@@ effici@@ ents of potential are sym@@ metric , so that formula _ 20 , et@@ c .
the reference point for this potential is a the@@ ore@@ tical hol@@ low conducting sp@@ here , of in@@ fin@@ ite radi@@ us , cen@@ tered on the conduc@@ tor .
stra@@ y capac@@ it@@ ance can allow signals to le@@ ak between otherwise isolated cir@@ cu@@ its ( an effect called cros@@ stal@@ k ) , and it can be a limiting factor for proper functioning of cir@@ cu@@ its at high frequ@@ ency .
this is tri@@ vi@@ al in cases with high sym@@ me@@ try .
in n@@ an@@ os@@ cal@@ e capac@@ itors , however , the elec@@ tro@@ st@@ atic poten@@ ti@@ als experienced by elec@@ tr@@ ons are determined by the number and locations of all elec@@ tr@@ ons that contribute to the electronic properties of the device .
the defin@@ ition of capac@@ it@@ ance , : formula _ 28 , with the potential difference : formula _ 29@@ may be applied to the device with the addition or removal of individual elec@@ tr@@ ons , : formula _ 30 and formula _ 31 .
then : formula _ 3@@ 2@@ is the " qu@@ ant@@ um capac@@ it@@ ance " of the device .
the primary differences between n@@ an@@ os@@ cal@@ e capac@@ itors and mac@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic ( conventional ) capac@@ itors are the number of exc@@ ess elec@@ tr@@ ons ( charge carrier , or elec@@ tr@@ ons that contribute to the device 's electronic behavi@@ or ) and the shape and size of metal@@ lic elec@@ tro@@ des .
