in all ES@@ PA@@ D countries at least two thirds of the students have dr@@ un@@ k alcohol at least once during their lif@@ etime , with an ES@@ PA@@ D average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
beer is even more dominant among boys , accounting for about half their total consumption on the last drinking day . girls have a more even@@ ly distributed pat@@ tern , with spir@@ its as the most important type , con@@ stitut@@ ing about one third of the total consumption .
other countries with large increases include Poland ( which returned close to the 1999 level after a drop in 2003 ) ( 16 percentage points ) , France ( 15 ) , Croatia ( 14 ) and Bulgaria ( 12 ) .
lif@@ etime use of mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms was reported by 3 % while G@@ H@@ B and ster@@ o@@ ids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de as reported experience of in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug use .
only 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 % in Armenia , the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries are most often found in western Europe .
overall , one out of seven past @@@ -@@ @ year can@@ na@@ bis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related problems , and the average pre@@ val@@ ence of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users across countries was 2 % .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall up@@ ward trend when the period is considered all in all .
since there is a high co @@@ -@@ @ vari@@ ation between illi@@ cit drug use and can@@ na@@ bis use on the country level , quite n@@ atur@@ ally the development for lif@@ etime can@@ na@@ bis use is more or less the same as described for all illi@@ cit drugs above .
the overall impression is that the increase in illi@@ cit drug use between 1995 and 2003 noted among the ES@@ PA@@ D countries has at least come to a halt , if not a decrease , especially considering that there are no increases in any country for recent use of can@@ na@@ bis between 2003 and 2007 .
the up@@ ward trend between 1995 and 2003 in lif@@ etime use of illi@@ cit drugs - predominantly can@@ na@@ bis - has come to a halt ; the 2007 figure is three percentage points below that for 2003 .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe includes an increasing , and ag@@ eing , population of people with heroin problems , who are likely to require care and remain major consumers of resources for many years to come .
the emer@@ gence of m@@ C@@ P@@ P illu@@ stra@@ tes the fact that those involved in the production of illi@@ cit drugs are constantly looking for innovation in the form of new chem@@ ic@@ als that can be introduced to the market - in this case probably to poten@@ ti@@ ate or modi@@ fy the effects of M@@ D@@ MA ( ec@@ st@@ asy ) .
there are simil@@ ar@@ ities with the 2004 evaluation of the 1999 Portuguese national drug strategy and the 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 04 action plan , conducted ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally by the Portuguese National Institute for Public Administration and intern@@ ally by the Institute for Dru@@ gs and Ad@@ diction ( I@@ D@@ T ) .

as in the evaluation of the EU action plan ( 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 04 ) , the ste@@ ering group will be made up of representatives of relevant Commission departments , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol , as well as representatives of the M@@ ember States .

chapter 1 : policies and laws
difficulties in defining the quanti@@ ty of a single d@@ ose and evidence that the exception has been mis@@ used in court to benefit drug deal@@ ers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annul@@ ment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint direc@@ tive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecut@@ ors @@@ -@@ @ General dealt with can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ements .
the af@@ ore@@ mentioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sent@@ encing of over 1 800 cases in six different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ( Sch@@ ä@@ fer and Pa@@ ol@@ i , 2006 ) .
a survey carried out in 2004 among 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds in Finland showed that about 7 % of those who had used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year had financed their use illegally , more than half by selling drugs and the rest mainly by ste@@ aling ( Ki@@ vi@@ v@@ u@@ ori et al . , 2005 , cited in the Finnish national report ) .
in Romania , court sent@@ encing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social re@@ integration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the san@@ ction under surveillance .
in most EU M@@ ember States the majority of reported drug law offences ( 17 ) are related to drug use or possession for use ( 18 ) , ranging in 2004 from 61 % of all drug law offences in Poland to 90 % in Austria .
in this regard , it is hel@@ p@@ ful that the concept of selec@@ tive prevention does not focus on drug use and does not sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ se drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulner@@ ability in a broader sense .
several M@@ ember States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
by 2001 , 24 EU countries as well as Bulgaria , Romania and Norway had introduced it ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 ) . however , scale and coverage differ considerably between countries ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .
32 receiving such treatment stabil@@ ised or decreased (
the reduction of dru@@ g@@ related deaths was defined for the first time as a European drug policy objective six years ago , and it is an objective of the current EU action plan ( 33 ) .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing inf@@ ec@@ tious disease are clearly ge@@ ar@@ ed towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for deliver@@ ing medical and social services .
an initiative in this direction is the joint E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA @@@ -@@ @ cor@@ relation project , supported by experts from the national fo@@ cal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
other countries also mentioned in 2004 as source countries for the can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in seized in the EU include Albania , Portugal , Sen@@ eg@@ al , Afghanistan , Pakistan and countries in central Asia ( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports , 2005 ; W@@ C@@ O , 2005 ; IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 6@@ a ) .

( 53 ) The average pro@@ portion was compu@@ ted as the average of national pre@@ val@@ ence rates weigh@@ ted according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
participation in ES@@ PA@@ D has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU M@@ ember States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
by contrast , in the 2004 US national survey on drug use and health ( 60 ) , 4@@ 0.2 % of adults ( defined as aged 12 years and older ) reported lif@@ etime use , compared with the EU average of about 20 % .
countries where the rate is higher than 25 % include Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia ( 27 @@@ -@@ @ 28 % ) and Belgium , France , Ireland and the United Kingdom , where lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence ran@@ ges from 32 % to 40 % .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 4@@ a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily can@@ na@@ bis users .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents seeking treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use who have co@@ existing mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influ@@ encing demand for treatment ( 78
the importance of this is underlined by evidence that early @@@ -@@ @ on@@ set users ( pre@@ - to mid @@@ -@@ @ ad@@ o@@ le@@ sc@@ ence ) have a significantly higher risk of developing drug problems , including dependence ( V@@ on Sy@@ dow et al . , 2002 ; Ch@@ en et al . , 2005 ) .
this kind of approach is now used in several countries , including Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and the United Kingdom , where interven@@ tions may take the form of coun@@ selling , " can@@ na@@ bis courses " or even self @@@ -@@ @ help websites .
for example , the German website @@@ -@@ @ based coun@@ selling programme , Qu@@ it the S@@ hit ( www.@@ dru@@ g@@ com@@ .@@ de ) , is an innovative approach , using te@@ lem@@ atics , for can@@ na@@ bis users who want to reduce or stop their drug use .

demands for treatment related to ec@@ st@@ asy use are reported to account for less than 1 % of all treatment demands in most countries , with the exception of Cyprus , Hungary , Ireland and Turkey , where ec@@ st@@ asy clients constitute between 4 % and 6 % of all clients seeking treatment .
reports about ac@@ ute or chron@@ ic health problems requiring medical interven@@ tions relating to the use of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic substan@@ ces by young people .
the decision also provides for an assessment of the risks associated with these new substan@@ ces so that measures applic@@ able in the M@@ ember States for the control of narco@@ tic and psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic substan@@ ces ( 2 ) can also be applied to new psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces if appropriate .
most of the cocaine seized in Europe comes directly from South America ( mainly Col@@ om@@ bia ) or via Central America and the Car@@ ib@@ be@@ an . in 2004 , Sur@@ in@@ ame , Brazil , Argentina , Venezuela , E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , Cur@@ aç@@ ao , J@@ am@@ a@@ ica , Mexico , G@@ uy@@ ana and Pan@@ ama were reported as transit countries for cocaine imported into the EU ( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports , 2005 ; W@@ C@@ O , 2005 ; CN@@ D , 2006 ; IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 6@@ a ; Europol , 2006 ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe better identified by focusing the analysis on groups in which drug use is concentrated , in particular young people living in urban areas .
as cocaine use can escal@@ ate quickly , brief interven@@ tions that can alert users to the fact that they may be beginning to experience negative consequences due to their use of the drug may also be worth expl@@ oring .
for example , one study of an innovative out@@ reach treatment programme in Rot@@ ter@@ dam ( Hen@@ s@@ ken@@ s , 2004 , cited in the Dutch national report ) identified factors that were observed to be important for tre@@ ating this group of clients , who are often difficult to engage in conventional drug services .
Netherlands ( 16@@ 7 ) . the average p@@ urity of heroin products has been f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ating in most reporting countries ( 16@@ 8 ) since 1999 , making it difficult to identify any overall trend .
for example , in countries with a high pro@@ portion of sti@@ mul@@ ant users ( the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) , the rates of in@@ j@@ ecting among heroin users might not be representative of the overall situation .
in some EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember States from which data are available ( Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom ) , rates of in@@ j@@ ecting among heroin users in treatment have declined .
in France , where HIV cases have been recorded only since 2003 , there has been an increase in the inci@@ dence of HIV among I@@ D@@ U@@ s ( al@@ be@@ it from a low level ) , from an estimated 2.3 cases per million population in 2003 to 2.9 cases in
41 % of a samp@@ le of 9@@ 64 in 2001 to 54 % of 350 in 2005 ) and excep@@ tionally high in another ( Ko@@ h@@ t@@ la @@@ -@@ @ J@@ ä@@ r@@ ve : 90 % out of 100 ) .
since the mid@@ 1990s , the European response has been characterised by an increasing provision of drug dependence treatment ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and overall this appears to be one of the elements that have contributed to the relatively encouraging picture now seen in Europe in terms of ep@@ i@@ demic spread of HIV among in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
in 2003 @@@ -@@ @ 04 , pre@@ val@@ ence rates of over 60 % among I@@ D@@ U samples were reported from Italy and Poland , while samples with pre@@ val@@ ence rates of less than 20 % were recorded in Belgium , Ireland , Cyprus , Austria , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
in Finland , hep@@ ati@@ tis B noti@@ fic@@ ations among I@@ D@@ U@@ s have fallen ste@@ ep@@ ly in recent years , possibly as a result of vacc@@ ination programmes and a comprehensive ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge exchange system .
the purchase of sy@@ r@@ inges through pharmac@@ ies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , and the potential to explo@@ it this contact point as a con@@ du@@ it to other services clearly exists .
it was estimated that in six of the locations ( Am@@ sterdam , Barcelona , Dub@@ lin , London , Rome and Vienna ) 10 @@@ -@@ @ 23 % of the overall mortality among adults aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 49 years could be attributed to op@@ i@@ oid use , mainly over@@ dos@@ es , AIDS and external causes ( accidents , suic@@ ides ) .
in this section , and in the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA protocol , the term " dru@@ g@@ related deaths " ref@@ ers to those deaths caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs and , generally , oc@@ curr@@ ing shortly after the consumption of the sub@@ stance ( s ) .
national trends in dru@@ g@@ related deaths can provide some in@@ sight into developments in pat@@ ter@@ ns of problematic drug use in each country such as heroin ep@@ i@@ dem@@ ics and high @@@ -@@ @ risk behavi@@ ours ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . in@@ j@@ ection ) , as well as treatment provision and even differences in heroin avail@@ ability .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreas@@ es in the numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment avail@@ ability and harm reduction initiatives , although dec@@ lines in the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use may also be important .
although interpre@@ tations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths in some countries , these pat@@ ter@@ ns could be related to the trends in heroin in@@ j@@ ection ( 20@@ 9 ) .
however , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
it is also evident in a recent report from the European Commission , which found that the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 had played a role in encouraging M@@ ember States to develop and expand harm @@@ -@@ @ reduction activities .
drug use among those who are developing both physi@@ cally and socially can be a particular problem , and this issue is dealt with in detail in the accompan@@ ying selected issue on drug use in minors .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison sett@@ ings .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
these legal income opportunities are , however , not open to all and , in many areas , farmers " options are limited by high transport costs , poor roads and problems ar@@ ising from lack of security .
of drug treatment data and drug over@@ dos@@ es suggests that the heroin @@@ -@@ @ using population in Europe continues to age , although the picture in eastern European countries is less clear .
however , a study commissioned by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has shown that it is possible to assess Co@@ ordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Co@@ ordination out@@ comes ( Ken@@ is , 2006 ) .
a first ob@@ servation is that such instruments can be useful for a long@@ itu@@ din@@ al follow @@@ -@@ @ up of the national situation but that , to understand what is really going on , the result should be con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alised with the analysis of individual indicators within the inde@@ x@@ es .
this figure is likely to under@@ estimate the full extent of drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture , given the high level of under @@@ -@@ @ reporting . the six countries included in T@@ able 1 account for 76 % of the total public expendi@@ ture reported by EU M@@ ember States
in response to the EU drugs action plan 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is currently working towards developing a meth@@ od@@ ology that will enable the M@@ ember States , candidate countries and Norway to comp@@ ile stand@@ ardis@@ ed data on drug @@@ -@@ @ related expendi@@ ture .
in Ireland , substan@@ tive changes included the introduction of the Criminal Justice Ac@@ t 2006 , which sets out new offences of sup@@ plying drugs to prisoners , provisions to deal with anti@@ social behaviour and proposals to strengthen im@@ position of the 10 @@@ -@@ @ year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking drugs with a street value of EU@@ R 13 000 or more .
in Romania , a law implemented in June 2006 introduced the European arrest warrant and set out procedures for its use , as well as measures to improve judicial co@@ operation , surveillance and cross @@@ -@@ @ border pursu@@ it and transfer of legal procedures .
the term " reports " for drug law offences is given in qu@@ ot@@ ation marks because it describes different concep@@ ts in different countries ( police reports of suspected drug law offen@@ ders , charges for drug law offences , et@@ c . ) .
taking pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ reviewed scientific public@@ ations as an indicator of scientific activity , an analysis of such public@@ ations during 2005 and 2006 and quoted in the national reports reve@@ als a pat@@ tern of them@@ atic research priorities that var@@ ies between countries .
EU funding for drug @@@ -@@ @ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .
although selec@@ tive prevention is gaining in popularity , caution is required , especially when involving young people at risk in pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ er programmes ( Ch@@ o et al . , 2005 ; Dis@@ hion and D@@ od@@ ge , 2005 ) , because negative " Con@@ tag@@ ion effects " can occur among vulnerable groups .
approximately half ( 53 % ) of the out@@ patient clients are treated for primary op@@ i@@ oid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular can@@ na@@ bis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
in some countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Greece , Slovenia ) , struc@@ tured re@@ integration programmes are provided only as a follow @@@ -@@ @ on from successfully completed abst@@ in@@ ence @@@ -@@ @ based drug dependence treatment , and specific re@@ integration measures for clients in drug maintenance treatment are currently not available .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using can@@ na@@ bis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in can@@ na@@ bis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the range 10 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % ( 32
developing psy@@ cho@@ metric scal@@ es to identify intensive , dependent and problematic can@@ na@@ bis use in survey data there are important tempor@@ al differences between countries and waves of popularity ob@@ serv@@ able in the use of the drug since it began to become popular in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s ( 38 ) .
an example of this is data from Sweden ( 2005 Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national report ) where a relatively high level of experim@@ entation was reported in the 197@@ 0s among cons@@ cripts and school students , followed by a substantial decrease in the 1980s , and then a new rise during the 1990s to levels similar to those of the 197@@ 0s followed by a subsequent decrease in more recent years .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s on@@ wards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable in@@ sight into trends over time .
however , there are interesting vari@@ ations between countries , with can@@ na@@ bis being cited by less than 5 % of all clients reported as entering treatment in Bulgaria , Lithuania , Poland and Romania and by more than 30 % in Hungary and France . for the remaining countries , in 12 the pro@@ portion of
there are differences between countries in the frequ@@ ency of can@@ na@@ bis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily can@@ na@@ bis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
in Denmark , s@@ mas@@ h is an anonymous support and coun@@ selling project for young can@@ na@@ bis users , intended to reduce the harmful effects , provide information and support to help them stop smoking can@@ na@@ bis ( 52
in recent school surveys , increases in lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of ec@@ st@@ asy use occurred largely in parallel among both male and female school students , although there is a pro@@ gressive increase in the gender gap with increasing age .
imports from outside Europe are also reported by a number of other countries including Belgium , Germany , France and the United Kingdom ; and distribution may also be diversi@@ fying , with reports of increased activity through eastern and central Europe and both EU and neighbouring countries sometimes now reported as secondary transit locations .
estimates of cocaine use for shorter reference periods ( 98 ) suggest that in the last year , of the 3.5 million ( 2.@@ 4 % ) young adults who have used the drug , 1.5 million ( 1 % ) have used it in the last month .
estimates of problematic cocaine use are scar@@ ce and the P@@ D@@ U indicator is , except in few high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries , likely to be less reliable for this drug . ) Se@@ e F@@ ig@@ ure P@@ D@@ U @@@ -@@ @ 4 ( part II ) in the 2007 statistical bul@@ letin .
of the other countries able to provide data , the highest estimates have been reported from the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland and the United Kingdom , at between four and five cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 , and the lowest figures from Cyprus , Hungary and the Netherlands , at under one case per 1 000 .
information available from the treatment demand indicator ( T@@ DI ) does not cover all people in drug treatment , which is a considerably greater number ; only clients requ@@ esting treatment during the reported year are recorded , but a pilot project is currently being implemented in 2007 , aiming to extend the European data collection to treatment clients in continuous treatment ( 1@@ 23 ) and assess reporting coverage of national systems .
in the EU M@@ ember States and Norway , in 2005 , it is estimated that the number of drug sub@@ stitution treat@@ ments was at least 5@@ 85 000 . this estimate is based on treatment monitoring carried out in most countries and provides a general picture of service avail@@ ability .
for EU countries where estimates of problem op@@ i@@ oid use were available for 2005 , the extent of sub@@ stitution treatment among problem op@@ i@@ oid users was calculated ( F@@ ig@@ ure 10 ) .
the absolute decrease of new op@@ i@@ o@@ ids treatment demands , mainly due to heroin use , is confirmed by looking at the trend of new heroin clients : all the countries , except Bulgaria and Greece , report a decrease in the pro@@ portion of new requests for primary heroin use among new drug clients in the last seven years .
figure 10 : number of op@@ i@@ oid maintenance treatment clients as a percentage of the estimated number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users , 2005 generally high , education levels low , and between 10 % and 18 % are reported to be home@@ less .
most clients ( 60 % ) report initi@@ ation of op@@ i@@ oid use before the age of 20 ; first use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids after the age of 25 was very un@@ common ( 13@@ 3 ) .
in interpre@@ ting this data , a number of consider@@ ations should be bor@@ ne in mind : infected I@@ D@@ U@@ s may not be diagnos@@ ed if they are not in contact with health services ; new inf@@ ections may not necessarily be attributed to drug in@@ j@@ ection ; and , the number of cases
support for the conclusions drawn from the available case reporting data can be found by analy@@ sing levels of HIV infection in samples of new I@@ D@@ U@@ s ( those in@@ j@@ ecting less than two years ) and young I@@ D@@ U@@ s ( those under age 25 ) .
most available time series for the EU show stable pre@@ val@@ ence , suggesting that the numbers of infected I@@ D@@ U@@ s dying are balanced by the numbers of I@@ D@@ U@@ s contr@@ acting HIV infection .
among young I@@ D@@ U@@ s ( under age 25 ) in these samples , a high pre@@ val@@ ence ( over 40 % in at least one samp@@ le ) was found in seven countries and among new I@@ D@@ U@@ s , for whom data are not available for many countries , in Poland and the United
in Europe , most op@@ i@@ oid deaths are related to heroin , but often other substan@@ ces are also identified as having possibly played a role , in particular alcohol , benz@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines , or other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids and , in some countries , cocaine .
figure 13 : overall trend in ac@@ ute drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths , 1996 @@@ -@@ @ 2005 for all M@@ ember States with available data account for a decreas@@ ing pro@@ portion of over@@ dos@@ es ( 170 ) .
a collabor@@ ative study that started within an E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA project found that op@@ i@@ oid users recru@@ ited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their pe@@ ers of the same age ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) .
increases in the pro@@ portion of drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths in drug users aged under 30 years have been observed in Greece and among those aged under 25 years in Estonia , Luxembourg and Austria , and to a les@@ ser extent in Latvia and
a long@@ itu@@ din@@ al study on the effectiveness of treat@@ ments for heroin addi@@ ction , which will examine the association between re@@ tention in treatment and mortality , is currently under@@ way in Italy ( Bar@@ g@@ ag@@ li et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from op@@ i@@ oid drugs are at an ele@@ v@@ ated risk of an over@@ d@@ ose , if they rela@@ p@@ se back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) .
local production also poses a challenge for law enforcement bodies , as production sites are located close to the consumer , relatively easy to conce@@ al and do not necess@@ itate the transportation of drugs across national borders .
cocaine trafficking through west Africa : an area of concern and action population of problem drug users in Europe , but also among the better socially integrated groups of young people who use drugs on a more rec@@ re@@ ational basis .
however , pat@@ ter@@ ns of sti@@ mul@@ ant use differ across Europe : cocaine is now the most com@@ mon@@ ly used sti@@ mul@@ ant in many countries in the south and west of Europe , and its use continues to grow .
relatively high levels of initi@@ ation also appear to be still oc@@ curr@@ ing in some M@@ ember States , as indicated by studies among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users that show a relatively high pro@@ portion of young and new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
in 2008 , 13 EU M@@ ember States have already red@@ raf@@ ted or are due to review and red@@ ra@@ ft their national dru@@ g@@ policy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policy@@ making at national level .

in Hungary , where N@@ SP@@ s and out@@ reach work have been increasing , a study among the out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
financial support for harm@@ reduction activities is provided by the Global Fund " Programme to fight against AIDS , malar@@ ia and tub@@ er@@ cul@@ osis , " while in Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia , UNODC has recently launched the project " HIV / AIDS prevention and care among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users and in prison sett@@ ings . "
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wal@@ es in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports ) . her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis in Europe is also reported to come from other parts of the world , including : West and southern Africa ( Ni@@ ger@@ ia , An@@ g@@ ola ) , south @@@ -@@ @ east Asia ( Tha@@ il@@ and ) , south @@@ -@@ @ west Asia ( Pakistan ) and the Americ@@ as ( Col@@ om@@ bia , J@@ am@@ a@@ ica ) ( CN@@ D , 2008 ; Europol , 2008 ) .
can@@ na@@ bis can be cultiv@@ ated in a wide range of environ@@ ments and gro@@ ws wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultiv@@ ated in 17@@ 2 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
after a period of stabilisation in 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 03 , the number of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in seiz@@ ures is increasing in Europe , while the quantities inter@@ cep@@ ted increased until 2003 @@@ -@@ @ 04 , but there@@ after have been declining .
the data on European drug seiz@@ ures mentioned in this chapter can be found in T@@ ables S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 1 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 2 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 3 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 4 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 5 and S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 6 in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
however , there are still differences between countries in the meth@@ od@@ ology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
it is conserv@@ atively estimated that can@@ na@@ bis has been used at least once ( lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence ) by more than 70 million Europeans , that is over one in five of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ ye@@ ar@@ - ol@@ ds ( see T@@ able 2 for a sum@@ m@@ ary of the data ) .
population survey data suggest that , on average , 31 % of young European adults ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 years ) have ever used can@@ na@@ bis , while 13 % have used the drug in the last year and 7 % have used it in the last month .
esti@@ m@@ ating intensive and long @@@ -@@ @ term pat@@ ter@@ ns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .
although among can@@ na@@ bis users the last month pre@@ val@@ ence of other drug use remained low ( below 10 % ) , levels of cigarette smoking and bin@@ ge drinking among can@@ na@@ bis users was about double that ( 80 % ) found among the general student population .
a comparison of H@@ B@@ SC data of 2001 / 02 and 2005 / 06 shows a stable or decreas@@ ing trend in both lif@@ etime and other more frequent can@@ na@@ bis use among 15 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school students in most EU countries ( 49 ) .
among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , can@@ na@@ bis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .
overall , primary can@@ na@@ bis users entering treatment can be divided in to three groups , in terms of frequ@@ ency of use : those who use it occasi@@ onally ( 30 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 30 % ) and those using it daily ( 40 % ) ( 57 ) .
project Pr@@ ism is an international initiatives et up to prevent the di@@ version of prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als used in the illi@@ cit manufac@@ ture of syn@@ thetic drugs , through a system of pre@@ export noti@@ fic@@ ations for li@@ cit trade and the reporting of ship@@ ments stopped and seiz@@ ures made when suspicious transactions occur .
seiz@@ ures of saf@@ role , which may replace 3,4 @@@ -@@ @ M@@ DP @@@ -@@ @ 2 @@@ -@@ @ P in the syn@@ th@@ es@@ is of M@@ D@@ MA , remained margin@@ al in 2006 , with 62 lit@@ res seized worldwide , mostly in Australia ; in Europe , only France reported a seiz@@ ure of saf@@ role ( 7 lit@@ res ) .
for example , rec@@ re@@ ational and less intensive and damaging pat@@ ter@@ ns of use among socially wel@@ lin@@ tegrated users can co@@ exist with intensive use among more margin@@ alised groups , with greater association with dependence problems and more risk@@ y mo@@ des of administration , such as in@@ j@@ ection and smoking .
only one M@@ ember State ( Finland ) has provided a recent national estimate of problem amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use , which in 2005 was estimated to amount to between 1@@ 2000 and 2@@ 2000 problem amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users ( 4.3 to 7.@@ 9 cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 , aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 54 years ) , about four times the estimated number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users in the country .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe been reported by Latvia and Denmark , while in Sweden and Finland the percentage of new amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine clients declined , possibly suggesting an ag@@ eing population ( 67 ) .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Gri@@ ff@@ i@@ ths et al . , 2008 ) .
stable there@@ after . a marked increase in amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use is reported in Denmark between 1994 and 2000 , but the results of the 2005 survey indicate a decrease in the use of this sub@@ stance since the beginning of this decade ( 73
countries with sufficient data on last year pre@@ val@@ ence of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use among the 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .
West Africa : now a regional transit hub for trafficking to Europe amount seized in Portugal since 2005 , accounting for 28 % of the European total in 2006 , points to the growing use of the I@@ ber@@ ian peninsula by cocaine traffickers as an entry point to the European market .
the second is a more margin@@ alised group of clients who are typically smoking or in@@ j@@ ecting cocaine ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) , and more often report using either cr@@ ack cocaine or the combination of cocaine and heroin .
in 2006 , around 8 000 cr@@ ack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 1@@ 02 ) .
following the increase of cocaine use and associated problems in several M@@ ember States , specialised drug treatment facilities face the difficult task of adap@@ ting their traditionally op@@ i@@ oid @@@ -@@ @ oriented services to the var@@ ied cocaine and cr@@ ack @@@ -@@ @ using populations .
for example , the incentive could be v@@ ou@@ chers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abst@@ in@@ ence . in this scenario , failure to stay dru@@ g@@ free results in the loss of the acc@@ um@@ ulated gains .
the amount of heroin inter@@ cep@@ ted in an average seiz@@ ure var@@ ied greatly between these two countries , with the size of the average seiz@@ ure in Turkey being 100 times that reported for the United Kingdom , reflecting different positions in the supply chain ( F@@ ig@@ ure 6 ) .
global seiz@@ ures of ac@@ etic an@@ hy@@ dri@@ de ( used in the illi@@ cit manufac@@ ture of heroin ) increased to 26 400 lit@@ res in 2006 , most of it recovered in the Russian Federation ( 99 00 lit@@ res ) and Col@@ om@@ bia ( 8 800 lit@@ res ) , followed by Turkey ( 3 800 lit@@ res ) ( IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 8@@ b ) .
O@@ pi@@ oid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational at@@ tain@@ ment than other clients ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequ@@ ency of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders is noted .
pres@@ cri@@ ption of medical heroin ( di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine ) , as a treatment option for chron@@ ic treatment @@@ -@@ @ res@@ istant op@@ i@@ oid users , is available to a limited extent in the Netherlands ( 8@@ 15 clients in 2006 ) , the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 400 clients ) and Germany , where the participants of the heroin trial continue to receive di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine according to a special regulation .
treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
by the end of 2006 , the inci@@ dence of diagnos@@ ed HIV infection among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users ( I@@ D@@ U@@ s ) appears to have been low in most countries of the European Union , and the overall EU situation appears relatively positive in a global context .
data on newly diagnos@@ ed cases related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use for 2006 suggest that infection rates are still falling overall in the European Union , following the peak in 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 02 , which was due to out@@ breaks in Estonia , countries , HIV pre@@ val@@ ence remained unchanged during the period .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA defin@@ ition of dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths ( 13@@ 6 ) ref@@ ers to those deaths that are directly caused ( po@@ is@@ on@@ ings or over@@ dos@@ es ) by the consumption of one or more drugs , where at least one of the substan@@ ces present is an illi@@ cit
the second component is broader and covers deaths which can@@ not be directly attri@@ but@@ able to the pharmac@@ ological action of the drugs , but are nevertheless linked with their use : long @@@ -@@ @ term consequences of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases , inter@@ actions with mental health issues ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . suicide ) or with other circumstances ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . road traffic accidents ) .
a recent Norwegian study of a co@@ h@@ ort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 18@@ 9 recorded deaths , over@@ dos@@ es , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
in one of these approaches , mortality rates are extra@@ po@@ lated from co@@ h@@ ort studies to local ( Bar@@ g@@ ag@@ li et al . , 2005 ) or national estimates of problem drug users ( C@@ ru@@ ts et al . , 2008 ) .
the number of deaths from other causes ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . consequences of other inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases , violence , accidents ) is more difficult to assess at present and there is a need to improve data collection and esti@@ mation in this area ( see prec@@ eding section ) .
the U@@ SA , for example , sof@@ tened its approach to the provision of ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @@@ -@@ @ term data .
commen@@ tary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem or near @@@ -@@ @ daily basis , with much higher levels found among young mal@@ es . this represents a large population at risk , and highlights the need for better understanding of the service needs of this group .
again , market factors and prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als appear important here , with meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine production sites appe@@ aring now to be located in Lithuania , whose geographical position facilit@@ ates the import of prec@@ ur@@ sors , in this case 1 @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ en@@ y@@ l @@@ -@@ @ 2 @@@ -@@ @ pro@@ pan@@ one ( BM@@ K ) , from outside of the European Union .
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @@@ -@@ @ based products , in particular her@@ bal mi@@ x@@ tures , as well as mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise containing syn@@ thetic compo@@ unds .
the enforcement of drug prohibi@@ tion is jud@@ ged by the study to have caused substantial un@@ intended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . geographical dis@@ placement of production and trafficking ) .
the new EU action plan identi@@ fies five key priorities that reflect its areas of action : improving Co@@ ordination , co@@ operation and raising public awareness ; reducing the demand for drugs ; reducing the supply of drugs ; improving international co@@ operation ; and , improving the understanding of the problem . the new plan is more
it includes many of the elements put forward by the European Union , as can be seen in the plan of action , which re@@ views current drug policy problems and lists the actions that UN M@@ ember States have committed themselves to implementing during the next decade .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor , with only about half the number of objectives ( 24 ) and fewer actions ( 72 ) .
the involvement of non@@ governmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the prepar@@ atory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
in May 2008 , the European Commission 's Civil Society Forum on Dru@@ gs debated the first results of the evaluation of the EU drug action plan ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 ) and discussed the needs and possible contents of the following action plan ( European Commission , 200@@ 8@@ a ) .
Spain adopted a new drug strategy in February 2009 , and eight other countries ( Bulgaria , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Cyprus , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia ) were in the process of fin@@ alising and adopting new drug strategies and action plans during the first half of 2009 ; Latvia extended its 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 programme with a 1 @@@ -@@ @ year action plan .
the contribution of NGOs to the progress made in achieving the goals set at the 1998 UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS was reviewed by the Vienna NGO Committee on narco@@ tic Dru@@ gs , with financial support from the European Commission and several EU M@@ ember States .
in 1999 , Ireland created the new off@@ ence of possession of a large amount of drugs ( worth more than EU@@ R 12 700 ) with intent to supply , which would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years " imprisonment .
involving 7 000 students aged 12 @@@ -@@ @ 14 in seven European countries , the study is evalu@@ ating a programme based on the comprehensive social influence approach , which combin@@ es training in life @@@ -@@ @ skills with norm@@ ative education and knowledge acquisition on substan@@ ces .
girls accounted for the largest effect in terms of bul@@ lying , past @@@ -@@ @ week and past @@@ -@@ @ month alcohol consumption , while boys accounted for the largest effect for drinking more than five drin@@ ks on one occasion and having tried can@@ na@@ bis .
selec@@ tive prevention interven@@ es with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scar@@ ce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
the mean age of drug users entering in@@ patient treatment is 30 years , but op@@ i@@ oid and cocaine clients are on average older ( 31 ) than those in treatment for non @@@ -@@ @ cocaine sti@@ mul@@ ants ( 28 ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 26 ) .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment mod@@ ality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
in Ireland , for example , users are responsible for paying the rent and some domestic services , while support workers help them with their ten@@ ancy and to gain access to education , training or employment .
this is because many drug offences can be viewed as a " consen@@ su@@ al crime , " where con@@ sent@@ ing individuals secre@@ tly participate in an un@@ law@@ ful activity of which the police will remain unaware unless discovered by chance ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . during a fo@@ ot patrol ) or by active detection .
the value of this approach is supported by the results of a S@@ co@@ tti@@ sh study , which found that recover@@ ing drug users who received employment @@@ -@@ @ related support were three times more likely to have found paid employment ( Mc@@ In@@ tos@@ h et al . , 2008 ) .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including compu@@ ter@@ ised datab@@ ases and dedicated communication networks .
prisoners are entitled to the same level of medical care as persons living in the community , and prison health services should be able to provide treatment for problems related to drug use in conditions compar@@ able to those offered outside prison ( C@@ P@@ T , 2006 ; WHO , 2007 ) .
north America continued to account for the bul@@ k of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis seized ( 66 % ) , while quantities of res@@ in seized remained concentrated in western and central Europe ( 66 % ) ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
information on the poten@@ cy of loc@@ ally produced her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis over a number of years is available only for the Netherlands , where a recent decline in the mean poten@@ cy of n@@ eder@@ wi@@ et was observed , from a peak of 20.@@ 3 % in 2004 to 16.@@ 0 % in 2006 , remaining at that level in 2007 ( 47 ) .

the scientific literature suggests that a number of psy@@ cho@@ ther@@ ap@@ ies , such as motiv@@ ational and cogn@@ iti@@ ve@@ behavi@@ our@@ al ther@@ ap@@ ies , are effective for can@@ na@@ bis treatment but that none has been found to be more effective than the others ( N@@ ord@@ strom and L@@ evin , 2007 ) .

similarly , a decline noted in the number of heroin seiz@@ ures in the European Union until 2003 has now been replaced by a steady increase . in the most recent data on drug law offences , an increase in the number of heroin @@@ -@@ @ related cases may also be observed .

rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( F@@ ig@@ ure 13 ) .

drug users are informed about over@@ d@@ ose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abst@@ in@@ ence , the effects and risks of pol@@ y@@ drug use , in particular con@@ com@@ it@@ ant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
according to expert ratings from 24 countries , prison pre @@@ -@@ @ release coun@@ selling on over@@ d@@ ose risk and prevention is currently not provided in six European countries , only provided to a few problem drug users in prison in 10 countries , and to less than half of them in a further six countries .

the use of op@@ i@@ ates and can@@ na@@ bis is usually considered to be unlikely to lead to psych@@ op@@ harmac@@ olog@@ ically indu@@ ced crime , and may even contribute to reducing it in some individuals , as these drugs ( and tran@@ qu@@ il@@ lis@@ ers ) tend to reduce violent imp@@ ul@@ ses and aggres@@ sion .
Studies of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime have often over@@ looked drug law offences as the link between drugs and crime is of a very different nature - in this case drugs and crime are linked by defin@@ ition in the law , rather than by any effect of one behaviour on the other .
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the pro@@ portion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .

in the 20@@ 20@@ s , the estimated increase in heat @@@ -@@ @ related mortality resulting from projected climate change could exceed 25 000 per year , mainly in central and southern European regions ( 69 ) .

overall , therefore , the projections show that better management of municipal waste will reduce green@@ house gas emissions in Europe , dec@@ ou@@ pling environmental pressures from economic growth as called for in the Si@@ x@@ th Environment Action Programme .

this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Co@@ p 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the K@@ yo@@ to ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
however a range of other options are available to help them reach their target ( see box : get us to K@@ yo@@ to on time ) . ' K@@ yo@@ to ' has been quite controversial mainly because the United States did not ratify it and because developing
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
