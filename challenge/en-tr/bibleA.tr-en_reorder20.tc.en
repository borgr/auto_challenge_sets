" to the children of Levi , behold , I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance , in return for their service which they serve , even the service of the tent of Meeting .
for the tithe of the children of Israel , which they offer as a wave offering to Yahweh , I have given to the Levites for an inheritance : therefore I have said to them , ' Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance . ' "
" moreover you shall speak to the Levites , and tell them , ' When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh , a tithe of the tithe .
he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the evening : and it shall be to the children of Israel , and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them , for a statute forever .
but the man who shall be unclean , and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly , because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh : the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him ; he is unclean .
from there they traveled , and encamped on the other side of the Arnon , which is in the wilderness , that comes out of the border of the Amorites : for the Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .

behold , one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses , and in the sight of all the Congregation of the children of Israel , while they were weeping at the door of the tent of Meeting .
now the name of the man of Israel that was slain , who was slain with the Midianite woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a fathers ' house among the Simeonites .
the sons of Eliab : Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . these are that Dathan and Abiram , who were called of the Congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against Yahweh ,
" our father died in the wilderness , and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah : but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
who may go out before them , and who may come in before them , and who may lead them out , and who may bring them in ; that the Congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which have no shepherd . "
he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the Congregation . "
but if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it , then he shall make void her vow which is on her , and the rash utterance of her lips , with which she has bound her soul : and Yahweh will forgive her .
but if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them , then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her soul , shall not stand : her husband has made them void ; and Yahweh will forgive her .
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day , then he establishes all her vows , or all her bonds , which are on her : he has established them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
they killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain : Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , the five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword .
the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones ; and all their livestock , and all their flocks , and all their goods , they took for a prey .
they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , to Moses , and to Eleazar the priest , and to the Congregation of the children of Israel , to the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by the Jordan at Jericho .
even of the children of Israel 's half , Moses took one drawn out of every fifty , both of man and of animal , and gave them to the Levites , who performed the duty of the tabernacle of Yahweh ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock : and when they saw the land of Jazer , and the land of Gilead , that behold , the place was a place for livestock ;
for when they went up to the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them .
Yahweh 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh , was consumed .
Moses gave to them , even to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land , according to its cities and borders , even the cities of the surrounding land .

" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land of Canaan ( this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan according to its borders ) ,
and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass along to Zin ; and the goings out of it shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea ; and it shall go forth to Hazar Addar , and pass along to Azmon ;
and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall go down , and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward ;
for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers ' houses , and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers ' houses , have received , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh have received , their inheritance :
and the Congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood , and the Congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge , where he was fled : and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest , who was anointed with the holy oil .
" ' so you shall not pollute the land in which you are : for blood , it pollutes the land ; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him who shed it .
the heads of the fathers ' households of the family of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spoke before Moses , and before the princes , the heads of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel :
when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be , then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong : so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers . "
it happened in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spoke to the children of Israel , according to all that Yahweh had given him in commandment to them ;
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us . "
moreover your little ones , whom you said should be a prey , and your children , who this day have no knowledge of good or evil , they shall go in there , and to them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
you shall purchase food of them for money , that you may eat ; and you shall also buy water of them for money , that you may drink . ' "
this day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky , who shall hear the report of you , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of you . "
from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the valley , even to Gilead , there was not a city too high for us ; Yahweh our God delivered up all before us :
( for only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; isn 't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon ? nine cubits was its length , and four cubits its breadth , after the cubit of a man . )
and the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , the kingdom of Og , gave I to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , even all Bashan . ( the same is called the land of Rephaim .
to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon , the middle of the valley , and its border , even to the river Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
only take heed to yourself , and keep your soul diligently , lest you forget the things which your eyes saw , and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life ; but make them known to your children and your children 's children ;
you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt , and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm : therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day .
it happened , when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , while the mountain was burning with fire , that you came near to me , even all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ;
and you said , " behold , Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that God does speak with man , and he lives .
Yahweh heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Yahweh said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
that you might fear Yahweh your God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prolonged .
and you shall teach them diligently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a Jealous God ; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you , and he destroy you from off the face of the earth .
remember , don 't forget , how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt , until you came to this place , you have been rebellious against Yahweh .
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Yahweh gave them to me .
and what he did to the army of Egypt , to their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day ;
for the land , where you go in to possess it , isn 't as the land of Egypt , that you came out from , where you sowed your seed , and watered it with your foot , as a garden of herbs ;
and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you , and he shut up the sky , so that there shall be no rain , and the land shall not yield its fruit ; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you .
every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even to the hinder sea shall be your border .
and the curse , if you shall not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which you have not known .
these are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has given you to possess it , all the days that you live on the earth .
then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there , there you shall bring all that I command you : your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the wave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh .
you may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain , or of your new wine , or of your oil , or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock , nor any of your vows which you vow , nor your freewill offerings , nor the wave offering of your hand ;
when Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border , as he has promised you , and you shall say , " I want to eat meat , " because your soul desires to eat meat ; you may eat meat , after all the desire of your soul .
if the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to put his name there , is too far from you , then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock , which Yahweh has given you , as I have commanded you ; and you may eat within your gates , after all the desire of your soul .
and you shall offer your burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and you shall eat the flesh .
you shall not do so to Yahweh your God : for every abomination to Yahweh , which he hates , have they done to their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , of which he spoke to you , saying , " Let us go after other gods " ( which you have not known ) " and let us serve them " ;
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
then you shall inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in the midst of you ,
if a poor man , one of your brothers , is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives you , you shall not harden your heart , nor shut your hand from your poor brother ;
you shall surely give him , and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him ; because that for this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work , and in all that you put your hand to .
but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell in , there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening , at the going down of the sun , at the season that you came forth out of Egypt .
and you shall rejoice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male servant , and your female servant , and the Levite , and the foreigner , and the fatherless , and the widow , who are within your gates .
if there is found in the midst of you , within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God , in transgressing his Covenant ,
then you shall bring forth that man or that woman , who has done this evil thing , to your gates , even the man or the woman ; and you shall stone them to death with stones .
the hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterward the hand of all the people . so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
if there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within your gates ; then you shall arise , and go up to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose ;
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you :
according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach you , and according to the judgment which they shall tell you , you shall do ; you shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you , to the right hand , nor to the left .
the man who does presumptuously , in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the evil from Israel .
that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers , and that he not turn aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he and his children , in the midst of Israel .
this shall be the priests ' due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep , that they shall give to the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
this is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
but the prophet , who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other gods , that same prophet shall die . "
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and see horses , chariots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Yahweh your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people , that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people .
but the women , and the little ones , and the livestock , and all that is in the city , even all its spoil , you shall take for a prey to yourself ; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies , which Yahweh your God has given you .
and it shall be , that the city which is nearest to the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd , which hasn 't been worked with , and which has not drawn in the yoke ;
it shall be , if you have no delight in her , then you shall let her go where she will ; but you shall not sell her at all for money , you shall not deal with her as a slave , because you have humbled her .
then it shall be , in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has , that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated , who is the firstborn :
so you shall do with his donkey ; and so you shall do with his garment ; and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother 's , which he has lost , and you have found : you may not hide yourself .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before you in the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eggs , and the hen sitting on the young , or on the eggs , you shall not take the hen with the young :
and accuses her of shameful things , and brings up an evil name on her , and says , " I took this woman , and when I came near to her , I didn 't find in her the tokens of virginity " ;
but it shall be , when evening comes on , he shall bathe himself in water ; and when the sun is down , he shall come within the camp .
he shall dwell with you , in the midst of you , in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates , where it pleases him best : you shall not oppress him .
to a foreigner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to possess it .
that which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God , a freewill offering , which you have promised with your mouth .
when a man takes a wife , and marries her , then it shall be , if she find no favor in his eyes , because he has found some unseemly thing in her , that he shall write her a bill of divorce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , who took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , who sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for that is abomination before Yahweh : and you shall not cause the land to sin , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance .
if a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel , and he deal with him as a slave , or sell him ; then that thief shall die : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his wickedness , by number .
forty stripes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then your brother should seem vile to you .
that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground , which you shall bring in from your land that Yahweh your God gives you ; and you shall put it in a basket , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
you shall come to the priest who shall be in those days , and tell him , " I profess this day to Yahweh your God , that I am come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers to give us . "
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you , that you shall set yourself up great stones , and plaster them with plaster :
it shall be , when you have passed over the Jordan , that you shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in Mount Ebal , and you shall plaster them with plaster .
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments which I command you this day , that Yahweh your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth :
Yahweh will make you the head , and not the tail ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be beneath ; if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day , that all these curses shall come on you , and overtake you .
your ox shall be slain before your eyes , and you shall not eat of it : your donkey shall be violently taken away from before your face , and shall not be restored to you : your sheep shall be given to your enemies , and you shall have none to save you .
Yahweh will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
they shall besiege you in all your gates , until your high and fortified walls come down , in which you trusted , throughout all your land ; and they shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land , which Yahweh your God has given you .
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the flesh of your sons and of your daughters , whom Yahweh your God has given you , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates .
it shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you , so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it .
that he may establish you this day to himself for a people , and that he may be to you a God , as he spoke to you , and as he swore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreigner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick ;
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Yahweh your God has driven you ,
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers , flowing with milk and honey , and they shall have eaten and filled themselves , and grown fat ; then will they turn to other gods , and serve them , and despise me , and break my Covenant .
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God . they have provoked me to anger with their vanities . I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people . I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
" go up into this mountain of Abarim , to Mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and see the land of Canaan , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because you didn 't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel .
Yahweh said to him , " This is the land which I swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , ' I will give it to your seed . ' I have caused you to see it with your eyes , but you shall not go over there . "
from the wilderness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth , but you shall meditate on it day and night , that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then you shall make your way prosperous , and then you shall have good success .
it happened about the time of the shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don 't know . pursue them quickly ; for you will overtake them . "
behold , when we come into the land , you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you used to let us down . you shall gather to yourself into the house your father , your mother , your brothers , and all your father 's household .
Joshua said , " Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Hivite , and the Perizzite , and the Girgashite , and the Amorite , and the Jebusite out from before you .
and when those who bore the Ark had come to the Jordan , and the feet of the priests who bore the Ark had dipped in the edge of the water ( for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest ) ,
it happened , when the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan , and the soles of the priests ' feet were lifted up to the dry ground , that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place , and went over all its banks , as before .
for Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until you had passed over , as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea , which he dried up from before us , until we had passed over ;
this is the reason Joshua circumcised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
the manna ceased on the next day , after they had eaten of the produce of the land . the children of Israel didn 't have manna any more ; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
the city shall be devoted , even it and all that is in it , to Yahweh . only Rahab the prostitute shall live , she and all who are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
the young men who were spies went in , and brought out Rahab with her father , her mother , her brothers , and all that she had . they also brought out all her relatives , and they set them outside of the camp of Israel .
but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things ; for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , took some of the devoted things . therefore Yahweh 's anger burned against the children of Israel .
it shall be , that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire , he and all that he has , because he has transgressed the Covenant of Yahweh , and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel . ' "
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yahweh . behold , I have commanded you . "
all the people , even the men of war who were with him , went up , and drew near , and came before the city , and encamped on the north side of AI . now there was a valley between him and AI .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their ambush on the west of the city ; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hurried and set the city on fire .
the others came out of the city against them , so they were in the midst of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side . they struck them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
it happened , when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of AI in the field , in the wilderness in which they pursued them , and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all Israel returned to AI , and struck it with the edge of the sword .
it happened , when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan , in the hill country , and in the lowland , and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite , heard of it
therefore the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their armies , and encamped against Gibeon , and made war against it .
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
Joshua took Makkedah on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with its king . he utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining . he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho .
Yahweh delivered it also , with its king , into the hand of Israel . he struck it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining in it . he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho .
Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel . he took it on the second day , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with all the souls who were in it , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
they took it , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with its king and all its cities , and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but he utterly destroyed it , and all the souls who were in it .
the children of Israel took all the spoil of these cities , with the livestock , as spoils for themselves ; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them . they didn 't leave any who breathed .
their border was from Aroer , that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the middle of the valley , and all the plain by Medeba ;
" now , behold , Yahweh has kept me alive , as he spoke , these forty @-@ five years , from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses , while Israel walked in the wilderness . now , behold , I am eighty @-@ five years old , today .
as yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now for war , to go out and to come in .
the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor , and so northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is over against the ascent of Adummim , which is on the south side of the river . the border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh , and ended at En Rogel .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron ; and the border extended to Baalah ( the same is Kiriath Jearim ) ;
and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir , and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north ( the same is Chesalon ) , and went down to Beth Shemesh , and passed along by Timnah ;
and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward ; and the border extended to Shikkeron , and passed along to Mount Baalah , and went out at Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .

the border extended , and turned around on the west quarter southward , from the mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward ; and ended at Kiriath Baal ( the same is Kiriath Jearim ) , a city of the children of Judah . this was the west quarter .
out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon ; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them . therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance .

the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
they came to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , to the land of Gilead , and they spoke with them , saying ,
" if we have not out of concern done this , and for a reason , saying , ' In time to come your children might speak to our children , saying , " What have you to do with Yahweh , the God of Israel ?
when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the Congregation , even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke , it pleased them well .
Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , to the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .

Naphtali didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh , nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath ; but he lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor .
the angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim . he said , " I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers ; and I said , ' I will never break my Covenant with you :
and they forsook Yahweh , the God of their fathers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the peoples who were around them , and bowed themselves down to them : and they provoked Yahweh to anger .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them ; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all around , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
yet they didn 't listen to their judges ; for they played the prostitute after other gods , and bowed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked , obeying the commandments of Yahweh . they didn 't do so .
they waited until they were ashamed ; and behold , he didn 't open the doors of the upper room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
far from the noise of archers , in the places of drawing water , there they will rehearse the righteous acts of Yahweh , the righteous acts of his rule in Israel . " then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates .
then Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as Yahweh had spoken to him : and it happened , because he feared his father 's household and the men of the city , so that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was broken down , and the Asherah was cut down that was by it , and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built .
behold , I will put a Fleece of wool on the threshing floor ; if there is dew on the Fleece only , and it is dry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and encamped beside the spring of Harod : and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
and you shall hear what they say ; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp . " then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp .
it was so , when Gideon heard the telling of the dream , and its interpretation , that he worshiped ; and he returned into the camp of Israel , and said , " arise ; for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian into your hand ! "
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , seventy persons , on one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his female servant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ) ;
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , you shall rise early , and rush on the city ; and behold , when he and the people who are with him come out against you , then may you do to them as you shall find occasion . "
Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people who were with him , from the ambush .
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and behold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
Abimelech , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
all the people likewise each cut down his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them at the base of the stronghold , and set the stronghold on fire on them ; so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .

while Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns , and in Aroer and its towns , and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon , three hundred years ; why didn 't you recover them within that time ?
then it shall be , that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , it shall be Yahweh 's , and I will offer it up for a burnt offering . "
the men of Ephraim were gathered together , and passed northward ; and they said to Jephthah , " Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon , and didn 't call us to go with you ? we will burn your house around you with fire ! "
when I saw that you didn 't save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and Yahweh delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
for , behold , you shall conceive , and bear a son ; and no razor shall come on his head ; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb : and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines . "

they said to him , " We have come down to bind you , that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines . " Samson said to them , " swear to me that you will not fall on me yourselves . "
the Philistines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
it happened , when their hearts were merry , that they said , " Call for Samson , that he may entertain us . " they called for Samson out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pillars ;
the man departed out of the city , out of Bethlehem Judah , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he traveled .
when they were a good way from the house of Micah , the men who were in the houses near to Micah 's house were gathered together , and overtook the children of Dan .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land .
it happened on the fourth day , that they arose early in the morning , and he rose up to depart : and the young lady 's father said to his son @-@ in @-@ law , " Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward you shall go your way . "
so they sat down , ate , and drank , both of them together : and the young lady 's father said to the man , " Please be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be merry . "
but the man wouldn 't stay that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus ( the same is Jerusalem ) : and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled ; his concubine also was with him .
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gibeah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim , and he lived in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjamites .
her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
when he had come into his house , he took a knife , and laid hold on his concubine , and divided her , limb by limb , into twelve pieces , and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel .
now therefore deliver up the men , the base fellows , who are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel . " but Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel .
but when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them ; and behold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst .
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the sword , both the entire city , and the livestock , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
then she arose with her daughters @-@ in @-@ law , that she might return from the country of Moab : for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread .

go back , my daughters , go your way ; for I am too old to have a husband . if I should say , ' I have hope , ' if I should even have a husband tonight , and should also bear sons ;
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @-@ in @-@ law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed .
now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim , of the hill country of Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephraimite :
therefore you shall make images of your tumors , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
the cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh ; they went along the highway , lowing as they went , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh .
the Levites took down the Ark of Yahweh , and the coffer that was with it , in which the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and they shall run before his chariots ;

" but they forgot Yahweh their God ; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the army of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab ; and they fought against them .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in coverts , and in pits .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might greet him .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
now it fell on a day , that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor , " Come , and let us go over to the Philistines ' garrison , that is on the other side . " but he didn 't tell his father .
between the passes , by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines ' garrison , there was a rocky crag on the one side , and a rocky crag on the other side : and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
but Jonathan didn 't hear when his father commanded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand , and dipped it in the honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel , he fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines : and wherever he turned himself , he defeated them .
Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning ; and it was told Samuel , saying , " Saul came to Carmel , and behold , he set up a monument for himself , and turned , and passed on , and went down to Gilgal . "
David said , " Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . " Saul said to David , " Go ; and Yahweh shall be with you . "
he took his staff in his hand , and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the Brook , and put them in the shepherd 's bag which he had , even in his wallet . his sling was in his hand ; and he drew near to the Philistine .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and slung it , and struck the Philistine in his forehead ; and the stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the earth .
then David ran , and stood over the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of its sheath , and killed him , and cut off his head therewith . when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , they fled .
the men of Israel and of Judah arose , and shouted , and pursued the Philistines , until you come to Gai , and to the gates of Ekron . the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim , even to Gath , and to Ekron .
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clothing , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his sash .
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
though men may rise up to pursue you , and to seek your soul , yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God . he will sling out the souls of your enemies , as from the hollow of a sling .
that this shall be no grief to you , nor offense of heart to my lord , either that you have shed blood without cause , or that my lord has avenged himself . when Yahweh has dealt well with my lord , then remember your handmaid . "
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " Go up in peace to your house . behold , I have listened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
Abigail came to Nabal ; and behold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king . Nabal 's heart was merry within him , for he was very drunken . therefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
David arose , and came to the place where Saul had encamped ; and David saw the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his army : and Saul lay within the place of the wagons , and the people were encamped around him .
so David and Abishai came to the people by night : and , behold , Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons , with his spear stuck in the ground at his head ; and Abner and the people lay around him .
it happened in those days , that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . Achish said to David , " Know assuredly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
the woman said to him , " behold , you know what Saul has done , how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land . why then do you lay a snare for my life , to cause me to die ? "
the woman came to Saul , and saw that he was very troubled , and said to him , " behold , your handmaid has listened to your voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have listened to your words which you spoke to me .
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , depart . "
it happened , when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South , and on Ziklag , and had struck Ziklag , and burned it with fire ,

all the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan ; and they came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
it happened on the third day , that behold , a man came out of the camp from Saul , with his clothes torn , and earth on his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the earth , and showed respect .
they mourned , and wept , and fasted until evening , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Yahweh , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead , and said to them , " blessed are you by Yahweh , that you have shown this kindness to your lord , even to Saul , and have buried him .
Joab the son of Zeruiah , and the servants of David , went out , and met them by the pool of Gibeon ; and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .

it was so , as the Ark of Yahweh came into the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh ; and she despised him in her heart .

when they had told David , saying , " Uriah didn 't go down to his house , " David said to Uriah , " haven 't you come from a journey ? why didn 't you go down to your house ? "
why have you despised the word of Yahweh , to do that which is evil in his sight ? you have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and have taken his wife to be your wife , and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon .
" this is what Yahweh says : ' behold , I will raise up evil against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wives before your eyes , and give them to your neighbor , and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun .

now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and your handmaid said , ' I will now speak to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant . '
then your handmaid said , ' Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest ; for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad . May Yahweh , your God , be with you . ' "
Joab fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and blessed the king . Joab said , " Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight , my lord , king , in that the king has performed the request of his servant . "

it stood on twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
he set the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward , toward the south .
the two pillars , and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ;
and the cups , and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the fire pans , of pure gold ; and the hinges , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , of the temple , of gold .
thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yahweh was finished . Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated , the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , and put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the princes of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel , to king Solomon in Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David , which is Zion .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , who were assembled to him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
Yahweh has established his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and I sit on the throne of Israel , as Yahweh promised , and have built the house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which you have said , ' My name shall be there ; ' to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place .
then hear in heaven , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way on his own head , and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
then hear in heaven , your dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of all the children of men ; )
" if your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name ;
if they sin against you ( for there is no man who doesn 't sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy , far off or near ;
yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive , saying , ' We have sinned , and have done perversely ; we have dealt wickedly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies , who carried them captive , and pray to you toward their land , which you gave to their fathers , the city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name :
and forgive your people who have sinned against you , and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you ; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh , he arose from before the altar of Yahweh , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven .
let these my words , with which I have made supplication before Yahweh , be near to Yahweh our God day and night , that he may maintain the cause of his servant , and the cause of his people Israel , as every day shall require ;
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
as for you , if you will walk before me , as David your father walked , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and the cities for his chariots , and the cities for his horsemen , and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and a horse for one hundred fifty ; and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
therefore Yahweh said to Solomon , " Because this is done by you , and you have not kept my Covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded you , I will surely tear the kingdom from you , and will give it to your servant .
they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran ; and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , to Pharaoh king of Egypt , who gave him a house , and appointed him food , and gave him land .
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam lived in Egypt ,
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Thus you shall tell this people who spoke to you , saying , ' Your father made our yoke heavy , but make it lighter to us ; ' you shall say to them , ' My little finger is thicker than my father 's waist .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
if this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord , even to Rehoboam king of Judah ; and they will kill me , and return to Rehoboam king of Judah . "
now there lived an old prophet in Bethel ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
but came back , and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you , " eat no bread , and drink no water " ; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers . ' "
the prophet took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the donkey , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn , and to bury him .
and tore the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it you ; and yet you have not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in my eyes ,
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and didn 't turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger .
it happened , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he struck all the house of Baasha : he didn 't leave him a single one who urinates on a wall , neither of his relatives , nor of his friends .
it happened , when Zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the castle of the king 's house , and burnt the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin , to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger with their vanities .
now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he showed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
it happened , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians , and went and served Baal , and worshiped him .
it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . behold , a voice came to him , and said , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "

but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time , and they shall search your house , and the houses of your servants ; and it shall be , that whatever is pleasant in your eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away . " ' "
the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city , did as Jezebel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
behold , I will bring evil on you , and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall , and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger , and have made Israel to sin . "
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " surely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . Jehoshaphat cried out .

he walked in all the way of ASA his father ; He didn 't turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he showed , and how he warred , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , in which he made Israel to sin .
then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him . he went up to him ; and behold , he was sitting on the top of the hill . he said to him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' Come down ! ' "
he went up , and lay on the child , and put his mouth on his mouth , and his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands . he stretched himself on him ; and the flesh of the child grew warm .
Elisha came again to Gilgal . there was a famine in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him ; and he said to his servant , " Set on the great pot , and boil stew for the sons of the prophets . "
so they poured out for the men to eat . it happened , as they were eating of the stew , that they cried out , and said , " Man of God , there is death in the pot ! " they could not eat of it .
it was so , when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , " Why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel . "
it happened , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he tore his clothes ( now he was passing by on the wall ) ; and the people looked , and behold , he had sackcloth underneath on his flesh .
they rose up in the twilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did the house of Ahab ; for he was the son @-@ in @-@ law of the house of Ahab .
for the whole house of Ahab shall perish . I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall , both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent them to him to Jezreel .
Jehu sent through all Israel ; and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that didn 't come . they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another .
however from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin , Jehu didn 't depart from after them , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
but Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh , the God of Israel , with all his heart . he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin .
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded ; and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sabbath , with those who were to go out on the Sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " Bring her out between the ranks . kill him who follows her with the sword . " for the priest said , " Don 't let her be slain in the house of Yahweh . "
all the people of the land went to the house of Baal , and broke it down ; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . the priest appointed officers over the house of Yahweh .

but Jehoiada the priest took a chest , and bored a hole in its lid , and set it beside the altar , on the right side as one comes into the house of Yahweh : and the priests who kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh .
it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king 's scribe and the high priest came up , and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yahweh .
they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work , who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh : and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders , who worked on the house of Yahweh ,
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ; he didn 't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; but he walked therein .
now the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?

but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel .
so Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria , saying , " I am your servant and your son . come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , who rise up against me . "
Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
the bronze altar , which was before Yahweh , he brought from the forefront of the house , from between his altar and the house of Yahweh , and put it on the north side of his altar .

therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dismayed and confounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green herb , like the grass on the housetops , and like grain blasted before it has grown up .
because of your raging against me , and because your arrogance has come up into my ears , therefore will I put my hook in your nose , and my bridle in your lips , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came . "
it happened that night , that the angel of Yahweh went out , and struck one hundred eighty @-@ five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .

of gold for the things of gold , and of silver for the things of silver , and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans . who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh ? "
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your commandments , your testimonies , and your statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "

I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , by which they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , by which they have sinned against me , and by which they have transgressed against me .
in the cities of the hill country , in the cities of the lowland , and in the cities of the South , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them , says Yahweh .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of it , saying :
at the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew , who has been sold to you , and has served you six years , you shall let him go free from you : but your fathers didn 't listen to me , neither inclined their ear .
but you turned and profaned my name , and caused every man his servant , and every man his handmaid , whom you had let go free at their pleasure , to return ; and you brought them into subjection , to be to you for servants and for handmaids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life ; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky , and to the animals of the earth .
Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , who have gone away from you .
but it happened , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians ; so we dwell at Jerusalem .
take a scroll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spoke to you , from the days of Josiah , even to this day .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
therefore you go , and read in the scroll , which you have written from my mouth , the words of Yahweh in the ears of the people in Yahweh 's house on the fast day ; and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities .
now it happened in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , in the ninth month , that all the people in Jerusalem , and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem , proclaimed a fast before Yahweh .
then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh , in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan , the scribe , in the upper court , at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh 's house , in the ears of all the people .
he went down into the king 's house , into the scribe 's room : and behold , all the princes were sitting there , Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the son of Achbor , and Gemariah the son of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the princes .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe ; and they told all the words in the ears of the king .
so the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll ; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe . Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king .
it happened , when Jehudi had read three or four leaves , that the king cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier , until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier .
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah : he shall have none to sit on the throne of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the Frost .
thus says Yahweh , He who remains in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live , and his life shall be to him for a prey , and he shall live .
then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king 's son , that was in the court of the guard : and they let down Jeremiah with cords . in the dungeon there was no water , but mire ; and Jeremiah sank in the mire .
now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , a eunuch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
my lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he is likely to die in the place where he is , because of the famine ; for there is no more bread in the city .
but if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and you shall not escape out of their hand .
they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
it happened that , when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's garden , through the gate between the two walls ; and he went out toward the Arabah .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath ; and he gave judgment on him .
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city , the deserters also who fell away to him , and the residue of the people who remained .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah , who were carried away captive to Babylon .
now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed to him men , and women , and children , and of the poorest of the land , of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon ;
as for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah , to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us : but you , gather wine and summer fruits and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that you have taken .
likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab , and among the children of Ammon , and in Edom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan ;
now it happened in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king , and ten men with him , came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah .
then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men who were with him , and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword , and killed him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men who were with him .
now it happened that , when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
if you will still live in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pluck you up ; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
then it shall happen , that the sword , which you fear , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt ; and the famine , about which you are afraid , shall follow close behind you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
so shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there : they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them .
for you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls ; for you sent me to Yahweh your God , saying , pray for us to Yahweh our God ; and according to all that Yahweh our God shall say , so declare to us , and we will do it :
it happened that , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God , with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Judah ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt , who lived at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Memphis , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of Judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
so that Yahweh could no longer bear , because of the evil of your doings , and because of the abominations which you have committed ; therefore your land has become a desolation , and an astonishment , and a curse , without inhabitant , as it is this day .
behold , I watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until they are all gone .
the message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah , when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
he made many to stumble , yes , they fell one on another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our birth , from the oppressing sword .
also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall ; for they also are turned back , they are fled away together , they didn 't stand : for the day of their calamity has come on them , the time of their visitation .
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants ; and afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , says Yahweh .
but don 't you be afraid , Jacob my servant , neither be dismayed , Israel : for , behold , I will save you from afar , and your seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and shall be quiet and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones , at the rushing of his chariots , at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers don 't look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
he who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring on him , even on Moab , the year of their visitation , says Yahweh .
those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon ; for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon , and a flame from the midst of Sihon , and has devoured the corner of Moab , and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones .
behold , I will bring a fear on you , says the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , from all who are around you ; and you shall be driven out every man right forth , and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives .
therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh , that he has taken against Edom ; and his purposes , that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : surely they shall drag them away , the little ones of the flock ; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them .
their camels shall be a booty , and the multitude of their livestock a spoil : and I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their beards cut off ; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them , says Yahweh .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
a sword is on their horses , and on their chariots , and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is on her treasures , and they shall be robbed .
they lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roars like the sea ; and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Babylon .
therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh , that he has taken against Babylon ; and his purposes , that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans : surely they shall drag them away , even the little ones of the flock ; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them .
against him who bends let the archer bend his bow , and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail : and don 't spare her young men ; utterly destroy all her army .

it shall be , when you have made an end of reading this book , that you shall bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates :
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and encamped against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem :
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people , and the residue of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Babylon , and the residue of the multitude .
the Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
the captain of the guard took away the cups , the fire pans , the basins , the pots , the lampstands , the spoons , and the bowls ; that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand ; They are knit together , they have come up on my neck ; he has made my strength to fail : the Lord has delivered me into their hands , against whom I am not able to stand .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger ! he has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel , And hasn 't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger .

the Lord has cast off his altar , he has abhorred his sanctuary ; He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces : they have made a noise in the house of Yahweh , as in the day of a solemn assembly .
the elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground , they keep silence ; They have cast up dust on their heads ; they have clothed themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
my eyes do fail with tears , my heart is troubled ; My liver is poured on the earth , because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , Because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city .
Yahweh has done that which he purposed ; he has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old ; He has thrown down , and has not pitied : he has caused the enemy to rejoice over you ; he has exalted the Horn of your adversaries .
arise , cry out in the night , at the beginning of the watches ; pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children , that faint for hunger at the head of every street .

now it happened in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
as for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , like the appearance of torches : the fire went up and down among the living creatures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above .
I saw as it were glowing metal , as the appearance of fire within it all around , from the appearance of his waist and upward ; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and there was brightness around him .

she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations , and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ordinances , and as for my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you are turbulent more than the nations that are around you , and have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept my ordinances , neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you ;
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter to all the winds .
therefore as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely , because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things , and with all your abominations , therefore will I also diminish you ; neither shall my eye spare , and I also will have no pity .
and say , You mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord Yahweh : thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills , to the watercourses and to the valleys : behold , I , even I , will bring a sword on you , and I will destroy your high places .

my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your abominations shall be in the midst of you ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , do strike .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
it happened in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in my house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell there on me .
then I saw , and behold , a likeness as the appearance of fire ; from the appearance of his waist and downward , fire ; and from his waist and upward , as the appearance of brightness , as it were glowing metal .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
he brought me into the inner court of Yahweh 's house ; and see , at the door of Yahweh 's temple , between the porch and the altar , were about twenty @-@ five men , with their backs toward Yahweh 's temple , and their faces toward the east ; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east .
the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clothed in linen , who had the writer 's inkhorn by his side .
Yahweh said to him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in its midst .
then I looked , and see , in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
the glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh 's glory .
the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen , who took it and went out .
their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes all around , even the wheels that the four of them had .
the cherubim lifted up their wings , and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth , and the wheels beside them : and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh 's house ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
in their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder , and carry it forth in the dark ; you shall cover your face , so that you don 't see the land : for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel .
I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my stuff by day , as stuff for removing , and in the even I dug through the wall with my hand ; I brought it forth in the dark , and bore it on my shoulder in their sight .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my snare ; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
so will I break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consumed in its midst : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , and be saved alive :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him an astonishment , for a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .

you took of your garments , and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors , and played the prostitute on them : [ the like things ] shall not come , neither shall it be [ so ] .
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your vaulted place , and break down your lofty places ; and they shall strip you of your clothes , and take your beautiful jewels ; and they shall leave you naked and bare .

your sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate ; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate ; and you and your daughters shall return to your former estate .

for in my holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them , serve me in the land : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offerings , and the first fruits of your offerings , with all your holy things .
as a pleasant aroma will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered ; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations .
